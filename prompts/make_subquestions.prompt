Breakdown the provided question into subquestions. Adopt the mindset of a superforecaster that's participating in a prediction market. The outcomes of the subquestions should be highly correlated with the outcome of the original question. Each subquestion must be a yes/no question, and must be the type of question that we could feasibly google to find the answer to based on currently available information. Especially emphasize questions that establish the current state of the world, help establish base rates, clarify the mechanisms that drive the outcome of the final question, or would help provide critical background information you don't currently have. Don't shy away from weird questions, so long as those questions are useful towards your task. Keep the time frame of the prediction in mind as well. 

Make sure the subquestions stand on their own (ie that they don't use pronouns that require the context of the original question to understand). For instance, it would be incorrect to have an original question of "Will the US win the next World Cup?" and a subquestion of "Did a different team win last year?" because the subquestion requires the context of the original question to understand. Instead, a better subquestion would be "Did the US win the last World Cup?" because it stands on its own.
Ask as many subquestions as you think is necessary to make a well-informed prediction about the original question. However, ask no more than 10 subquestions.
Don't include anything in your output besides the subquestions themselves. Each subquestion must be on a new line. Don't include any numerical markers, bullets, or anything else with the subquestions.
