    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS exceed 2.8M for November 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which can be access through [this link](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view), shows greater than 2,800,000 background check initiated in November 2024. If the number is less than or equal to 2,800,000, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNumbers are expected to be reported in the month subsequent, so for example October numbers are expected to be reported in November. In case of reporting delays, resolution will wait, until the question will be annulled in early January 2025 if there are no numbers reported by then for the time in question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn the long term (since the turn of the 21st Century), firearms sales in the US have risen, surging in 2020, with numbers trending downward since. Starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers have again begun trending upward.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) will exceed 2.8 million for November 2024, here are some relevant points and trends:\n\n## Historical Context and Trends\n- The number of NICS background checks has been consistently high, with over 1 million checks per month since July 2019[2].\n- In 2023, a total of 29.9 million background checks were registered, which is a decrease from the previous year but still a significant number[3].\n- The last quarter of 2023 saw a rebound in gun sales, with December 2023 totaling more than 1.7 million NSSF-adjusted NICS verifications, indicating a potential uptick in sales[5].\n\n## Election Year Impact\n- Historically, presidential election years have seen higher firearm sales and corresponding background checks. Since 2000, every presidential election year has had higher yearly NSSF-adjusted firearm sales totals than the previous year[5].\n- The upcoming 2024 election, with its polarized stances on gun control, is likely to influence gun sales and background checks, similar to past election years[1][5].\n\n## Recent Monthly Trends\n- August 2024 saw an 8.3% increase in NSSF-adjusted NICS background checks compared to August 2023, indicating a rising trend[2].\n- This increase follows a pattern where monthly background checks have been sequentially rising, with July 2024 marking the first year-over-year monthly increase since December 2023[2].\n\n## State and National Factors\n- States like North Carolina, Texas, Florida, and California have seen significant gun sales, with North Carolina experiencing a 112% increase in gun sales between 2022 and 2023 due to changes in local laws[1].\n- National factors such as economic instability, gun violence, and legislative actions are also driving the demand for firearms[1].\n\nGiven these points:\n- The historical trend of increased gun sales and background checks during presidential election years.\n- The recent rebound in gun sales and background checks.\n- The ongoing factors driving demand for firearms.\n\nIt is plausible that the number of NICS background checks could exceed 2.8 million for November 2024, especially considering the historical context and current trends. However, without specific data for November 2024, this remains a projection based on past trends and current indicators.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the 2024 presidential election contributing to higher firearm sales in the United States?\nANSWER: No, the 2024 presidential election does not appear to be contributing to higher firearm sales in the United States. According to the data from the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), October 2024 saw a five percent decline in FBI background checks related to gun sales compared to the same time the previous year. This indicates that, despite the stark contrast in gun policy between the major candidates, Americans are not motivated to buy more guns due to the election[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been an increase in gun violence in the United States since July 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no specific data provided that covers the period after July 2024. The sources provide detailed statistics up to July 2024 or the first six to eight months of 2024, but they do not extend beyond that point.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether there has been an increase in gun violence in the United States since July 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did states like North Carolina, Texas, Florida, or California enact new gun laws between July and November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information about new gun laws enacted in North Carolina, Texas, Florida, or California between July and November 2024. The sources discuss changes to gun laws in North Carolina that were enacted in March 2023 and earlier in 2024, but they do not cover the period from July to November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the number of NICS background checks increase in August 2024 compared to August 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, the number of NICS background checks increased in August 2024 compared to August 2023.\n\n- The unadjusted August 2024 FBI NICS figure of 2,163,540 reflects a 5.7 percent increase from the unadjusted August 2023 FBI NICS figure of 2,047,512[1][5].\n- The NSSF-adjusted NICS figure for August 2024 increased 8.3 percent year-over-year compared to August 2023[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have firearm sales in the United States increased since July 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, firearm sales in the United States have increased since July 2024.\n\n- In July 2024, gun sales saw a 5% increase over the previous year, and this trend continued with an even greater increase in August, where gun sales were up by 9% compared to August 2023[3].\n- The third quarter of 2024 also saw a 4.5% increase in sales-related background checks compared to the same period in 2023, indicating a rise in firearm sales[2].\n- Additionally, September 2024 saw a 1.3% increase in sales-related background checks over the previous year, further supporting the trend of increasing gun sales[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any reporting delays for NICS background checks for November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been reporting delays for NICS background checks and related state systems in November 2024.\n\n- In Washington State, a system disruption due to a network infiltration event has caused the background check system to be down since November 1-2, resulting in no background checks being conducted during this period[3].\n- In New Jersey, there have been delays in processing NICS background checks, with a significant number of submissions in the queue. As of November 8, 2024, 1089 submissions were pending, indicating ongoing delays[5].\n\nThese instances indicate that there have indeed been delays in the processing of background checks for November 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did October 2024 record more than 2.8 million NICS background checks?\nANSWER: Yes, October 2024 recorded more than 2.8 million NICS background checks. According to the sources, the unadjusted October 2024 FBI NICS figure was 2,298,383[2][4], and even though this is slightly below 2.3 million, it is still more than 2.8 million when considering the context of the question might be looking for a general affirmation of a high number of checks.\n\nHowever, to be precise, the unadjusted figure of 2,298,383 is indeed more than 2.2 million but less than 2.3 million. Yet, given the context and the emphasis on the high volume of checks, it can be inferred that the question is seeking confirmation of a significant number of checks, which is indeed the case.\n\nSo, to answer the question directly:\nYES.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are economic indicators in the United States suggesting increased demand for firearms?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are several indicators suggesting that demand for firearms in the United States is likely to remain strong or even increase, despite some fluctuations. Here are the key points:\n\n## Continued Strong Demand\n- The 2023 year was the fourth highest on record for firearm sales, with nearly 15.9 million firearms sold, which is only slightly lower than the 2022 total[4].\n- Despite a decline in sales from the peak in 2020, the demand for firearms has remained robust, with over 1 million firearm sales per month for 53 consecutive months as of December 2023[4].\n\n## Election Year Impact\n- Historical data shows that presidential election years tend to see higher firearm sales, and 2024 is expected to follow this trend due to the political climate and concerns about gun control laws[4].\n\n## Consumer Perspectives and Economic Factors\n- Consumers continue to be driven by personal safety concerns, increasing global unrest, and domestic politics, which are factors that increase demand for firearms[3].\n- Although economic uncertainties such as inflation and personal income changes can affect demand, they do not seem to be dampening overall interest in firearms significantly[3].\n\n## Legislative and Political Influences\n- The anticipation of stricter gun control laws, particularly under the Biden administration, can drive up demand as buyers anticipate potential changes in legislation[1][4].\n\nGiven these points, the economic and social indicators suggest that demand for firearms in the United States is likely to remain strong or increase.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did NICS background checks show a year-over-year increase in September 2024 compared to September 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the specific month-to-month comparison for September 2024 versus September 2023 in terms of NICS background checks is not directly stated. However, the sources do provide some relevant information:\n\n- The source from American Rifleman mentions that the third-quarter 2024 NSSF-adjusted NICS figure increased by 4.5% compared to the third-quarter 2023 figure, but it does not provide a specific month-to-month comparison for September[3].\n- The other sources do not provide the specific September-to-September comparison either[2][4].\n\nGiven the lack of direct comparison for the month of September, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are national legislative actions in 2024 favoring less restrictive gun control measures?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the answer is **NO**.\n\nHere are the key points that indicate national legislative actions in 2024 are not favoring less restrictive gun control measures:\n\n- The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2024 includes some measures that support gun safety, such as reauthorizing the Undetectable Firearms Act and funding community violence intervention programs, although it also includes some problematic provisions like cuts to the ATF's budget and a rider that could undermine background checks for veterans[1].\n\n- President Biden and Vice President Harris announced additional actions to reduce gun violence, including an Executive Order to combat emerging firearms threats and improve school-based active shooter drills. These actions aim to strengthen gun safety measures[3].\n\n- The Biden-Harris Administration implemented a new rule under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act to expand firearm background checks, which is a significant expansion of background check requirements[5].\n\n- California has strengthened its gun laws through a bipartisan legislative package signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, which includes measures to protect kids from guns, enhance safe storage requirements, and implement stricter penalties for gun owners whose guns are accessed by children[2].\n\nThese actions and legislation indicate a trend towards more restrictive and stringent gun control measures rather than less restrictive ones.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 2 weeks (by early December 2024).\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:** If existing trends continue without any significant changes, the number of NICS background checks for November 2024 is unlikely to exceed 2.8 million. Given that October 2024 recorded approximately 2.3 million checks, maintaining or slightly increasing this number would not suffice to reach the 2.8 million threshold.\n\n(c) **Forecast with only a quarter of the time left:** With only about half a week remaining until the resolution date, achieving the necessary increase from 2.3 million to 2.8 million would require an improbable surge in background checks. Therefore, the probability would be significantly lower, around 10%.\n\n(d) **Forecast with four times the time left:** If there were four times the current timeframe (which is not the case), there would be more opportunities for incremental increases to reach the 2.8 million mark. However, even with extended time, reaching a 24% increase in a single month remains unlikely without extraordinary circumstances.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Current Trends:** While there has been an upward trend in NICS background checks since July 2024, with October recording around 2.3 million checks, the jump to 2.8 million within the remaining two weeks of November would require an unprecedented increase of approximately 24%.\n- **Historical Data:** Historically, such significant month-over-month increases are rare unless driven by major events affecting firearm sales and background checks.\n- **Recent Subquestions Insights:** Factors like reporting delays in certain states and the absence of new gun law enactments that could spike sales further suggest that a substantial increase is unlikely within the short remaining period.\n- **Time Constraints:** Given the limited time left, there isn't sufficient opportunity for the trend to accelerate to the required level without significant and unforeseen changes.\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
