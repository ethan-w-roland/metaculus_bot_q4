    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill it rain more than 150mm in Bras칤lia, Brazil in December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves based on the amount of measured and recorded cumulative rainfall (in millimeters) at the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) weather station [83377] BRASILIA - DF for the month of December 2024.\n\nDETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Go to the INMET weather station map [here](https://mapas.inmet.gov.br/).\n2. Click the 游댌search icon on the left side of the screen.\n3. Paste this into the search box: [83377] BRASILIA - DF\n4. Click on the blue dot to access the weather station.\n\nTo access the precipitation data, click on \"Tabela\". The question will resolve based on the total *Chuva (mm)* for the month of December 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf the resolution source is unavailable or data have not been released for every day of December, resolution will wait until January 7, 2025 for the data to be available, at which point if they still are not available, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nThis question resolves based on the values shown when accessed by Metaculus after the data for December 31 are first released. Further revisions to the data will not be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBras칤lia, the capital city of Brazil, has [just had rain](https://brazilian.report/liveblog/politics-insider/2024/10/07/brasilia-longest-drought-ever/) after a record-breaking drought, characterized by 167 consecutive days of no rain. September 2024 was the [hottest September on record](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/noticias/brasil-tem-o-setembro-mais-quente-em-63-anos) for the area, and INMET expects 2024 to be one of the top 5 hottest years, which has also caused a surge in wildfires.\n\nDecember is typically the [wettest month](https://avionero.com/New-York-Brasilia.NYC-BSB/weather/december) for Bras칤lia, with rain averaging about 253 mm and an average of 21 rainy days in the month. See also [Weatherspark](https://weatherspark.com/y/30238/Average-Weather-in-Bras%C3%ADlia-Federal-District-Brazil-Year-Round), which found an average of about 215 mm and about 75% of days having at least 1 mm of rain.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine the likelihood of rainfall exceeding 150mm in Bras칤lia, Brazil in December 2024, here are some key points from the available data:\n\n## Historical Rainfall\n- December is typically one of the wettest months in Bras칤lia. The average rainfall in December is around 253 mm, according to historical data.\n\n## Monthly Rainfall Distribution\n- The average sliding 31-day rainfall during December in Bras칤lia remains essentially constant, around 8.4 inches (approximately 213 mm), and rarely exceeds 12.8 inches (approximately 325 mm).\n\n## Frequency of Rainy Days\n- December experiences a high number of rainy days, with an average of 24-26 days with at least some rainfall.\n\nGiven these points, it is highly likely that the rainfall in Bras칤lia in December 2024 will exceed 150mm. The historical average rainfall for December is significantly higher than 150mm, and the month is characterized by a high frequency of rainy days.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The base rate for December rainfall in Bras칤lia is well above 150mm, making it a strong indicator that this threshold will be surpassed.\n- The consistent pattern of high rainfall in December across different years and data sources reinforces this likelihood.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the historical data and typical weather patterns, it is very likely that Bras칤lia will experience more than 150mm of rainfall in December 2024.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have meteorological agencies issued advisories about potential drought conditions in Bras칤lia for December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of meteorological agencies issuing advisories about potential drought conditions in Bras칤lia for December 2024. The sources discuss general drought conditions and forecasts for various regions of South America, including Brazil, but do not provide detailed advisories specifically for Bras칤lia in December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are weather forecasts predicting below-average rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the forecasts do not indicate below-average rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024. Here are the relevant details:\n\n- According to the weather guide for Bras칤lia in December 2024, there are usually **26 days** with some rain, and the average monthly rainfall is **261mm**.\n- This suggests that the predicted rainfall is in line with or consistent with historical averages, rather than being below average.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, the forecasts are not predicting below-average rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is an El Ni침o event currently occurring and expected to affect Bras칤lia's rainfall in December 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nAs of the current updates, El Ni침o conditions are not present and are not expected to occur in the near future. The reports indicate that the 2023-24 El Ni침o event has dissipated, and current conditions are neutral, with a predicted transition to La Ni침a conditions later in the year.\n\nTherefore, an El Ni침o event is not currently occurring and is not expected to affect Bras칤lia's rainfall in December 2024. Instead, there is a significant likelihood of La Ni침a conditions emerging during this period.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the atmospheric moisture content over Bras칤lia expected to be lower than normal in December 2024?\nANSWER: No, the atmospheric moisture content over Bras칤lia is not expected to be lower than normal in December 2024. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- December is part of the rainy season in Bras칤lia, with high rainfall expected. The average monthly rainfall in December is around 261 mm.\n- Humidity levels are expected to be high, rising from 78% to 81% during December.\n\nThese indicators suggest that the atmospheric moisture content will be at or above normal levels for December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the drought in Bras칤lia from earlier in 2024 expected to persist through December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the drought in Bras칤lia and the broader region of Brazil is expected to continue for some time, but there is no specific indication that it will persist through December 2024.\n\n- The sources mention that the drought is severe and has broken records, with Bras칤lia ending its 167-day drought in early October 2024.\n- It is noted that rainfall sufficient to begin replenishing the rivers is not anticipated for several weeks, and river levels are expected to continue their decline until November.\n- However, there is no explicit statement that the drought will persist through December 2024.\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the months leading up to December 2024 shown significantly reduced rainfall in Bras칤lia compared to historical averages?\nANSWER: To determine if the months leading up to December 2024 have shown significantly reduced rainfall in Bras칤lia compared to historical averages, we need to compare the rainfall data for those months in 2024 with the historical averages.\n\n### Historical Averages:\n- October: 238 mm (9.4 in)\n- November: 238 mm (9.4 in)\n\n### 2024 Data:\nThe provided sources do not offer specific rainfall data for October and November 2024. They provide general historical averages and forecasts, but not the actual rainfall amounts for these specific months in 2024.\n\nGiven this, we cannot determine whether the rainfall in the months leading up to December 2024 was significantly reduced compared to historical averages because the specific data for 2024 is not available in the sources provided.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bras칤lia experienced December months with cumulative rainfall below 150mm in recorded history?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is evidence to suggest that Bras칤lia has experienced significant variability in rainfall, but specific instances of December months with cumulative rainfall below 150mm are not explicitly mentioned.\n\n- Source mentions that the driest year in December was 2019 with \"only 963 mm of rainfall for the year,\" but this does not specify the December rainfall alone. However, it does indicate that the average rainfall in December is around 253 mm, and the wettest year was 1992 with 1971 mm, suggesting significant variability.\n- Source and provide average rainfall figures for December, which are around 240-253 mm, but they do not provide specific historical data for individual years that might have had rainfall below 150mm.\n\nGiven the lack of specific historical data on individual December months with rainfall below 150mm, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are climate models projecting decreased rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024 due to climate change?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about climate models projecting decreased rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024 due to climate change.\n\n- The sources discuss general climate trends, historical weather data, and specific weather events, but they do not provide projections for December 2024 rainfall in Bras칤lia specifically.\n- The CLIMBra dataset mentioned in one of the sources provides bias-corrected climate model projections for Brazil, but it does not offer specific projections for December 2024 rainfall in Bras칤lia.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Bras칤lia receive less than 150mm of rainfall in December in any year within the last decade?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data that breaks down the rainfall in Bras칤lia for each year of the last decade. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The sources provide average rainfall data for December, but not year-by-year specifics. For example, mentions that December typically sees around 253 mm of rainfall, but does not provide yearly variations.\n- and discuss historical rainfall data, but they do not provide detailed yearly breakdowns for the last decade.\n- There is no mention of any year in the last decade receiving less than 150mm of rainfall in December.\n\nGiven this, the answer to whether Bras칤lia received less than 150mm of rainfall in December in any year within the last decade is **UNCLEAR**, as the sources do not provide the necessary detailed yearly data.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there active wildfires near Bras칤lia that could impact precipitation patterns in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Current Fire Activity**: The sources indicate that there have been intense and widespread wildfires in Brazil, particularly in the Amazon and Pantanal regions, during August and early September 2024. These fires have been driven by drought, climate change, and human activities such as deforestation.\n\n2. **Impact on Bras칤lia**: The smoke from these fires has affected several states, including the capital city of Bras칤lia, causing air quality issues, school closures, and flight groundings in mid-August and early September 2024.\n\n3. **Future Precipitation Patterns**: While the sources do not provide specific predictions for December 2024, they do mention that the fire season in the Amazon region typically peaks in August and September but can extend due to ongoing drought and deforestation. However, they do not specify whether these fires will continue into December or how they might impact precipitation patterns at that time.\n\nGiven this information, it is unclear whether there will be active wildfires near Bras칤lia in December 2024 or how they might impact precipitation patterns at that time.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately **2 months** remain until the end of December 2024, at which point the total rainfall will be known. The data should be available shortly after December 31, 2024.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf current patterns and historical averages hold, **Bras칤lia would receive well over 150mm of rainfall in December 2024**, as December is typically the wettest month of the year for the region.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith only **half a month** left until December 2024, the forecast would likely remain the same or become more confident, as short-term weather predictions become more accurate. The probability of exceeding 150mm would **increase slightly** due to improved forecasting.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nIf there were **8 months** remaining until December 2024, there would be greater uncertainty due to potential climatic changes or unexpected events. However, the historical trends would still support a high probability of exceeding 150mm of rainfall.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Historical Averages:**\n   - **Base Rate:** December is historically the wettest month in Bras칤lia, with average rainfall between **215mm and 261mm**.\n   - **Frequency of Exceeding 150mm:** Given the average, it is common for rainfall to exceed 150mm in December.\n\n2. **Recent Weather Patterns:**\n   - **Drought Ending:** The record-breaking drought of 167 days without rain ended in early October 2024.\n   - **Onset of Rainy Season:** October generally marks the beginning of the rainy season in Bras칤lia, leading up to the peak in December.\n\n3. **Climate Factors:**\n   - **El Ni침o/La Ni침a:** There are currently **no indications** of an El Ni침o event affecting Bras칤lia's rainfall in December 2024.\n   - **Climate Change:** While climate change can introduce variability, there is **no specific projection** indicating below-average rainfall for December 2024.\n\n4. **Recent Precipitation Trends:**\n   - **October and November Rainfall:** Data for October and November 2024 is not specified, but the onset of the rainy season typically brings increasing rainfall.\n   - **Impact of Prior Drought:** While the drought was severe, its end suggests a return to normal precipitation patterns.\n\n5. **Potential Risks:**\n   - **Variability:** There is always a chance of atypical weather patterns that could reduce rainfall.\n   - **Wildfires and Atmospheric Conditions:** Ongoing wildfires could potentially impact local weather, but there is **no clear evidence** they will reduce December rainfall.\n\n6. **Confidence Levels:**\n   - **Short-Term Forecasts:** As the event approaches, confidence in weather predictions increases.\n   - **Long-Term Uncertainty:** With more time, potential unforeseen climatic events introduce uncertainty.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the strong historical precedent for December rainfall exceeding 150mm in Bras칤lia, the recent end of the drought, and the lack of indicators for below-average rainfall, it is highly probable that December 2024 will see more than 150mm of rainfall.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
