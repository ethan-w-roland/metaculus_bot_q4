    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Oregon voters approve Oregon Measure 117, which would establish ranked-choice voting in the state?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-30\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Oregon Measure 117 is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Oregon Measure 117, Ranked-Choice Voting for Federal and State Elections Measure (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_117,_Ranked-Choice_Voting_for_Federal_and_State_Elections_Measure_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Oregon voters approving Measure 117, which would establish ranked-choice voting (RCV) for federal and state elections, here are some key points and relevant background information:\n\n## Current Voting System\nOregon currently uses a plurality voting system, where the candidate with the highest number of votes wins. Measure 117 would change this to a ranked-choice voting system, where voters rank candidates by preference, and the winner is determined through a process of elimination until a candidate achieves a majority of votes.\n\n## Support and Opposition\nThe measure has support from various groups, including Oregon Ranked Choice Voting Advocates and some Native organizations. House Speaker Dan Rayfield (D-16) has also expressed support, arguing that RCV will give voters more choice and strengthen democracy by ensuring winners are elected by a true 50% majority.\n\n## Public Opinion\nRecent polling data indicates that Oregon voters are split on the issue. A Public Policy Polling survey from October 16-17, 2024, showed mixed opinions among likely voters, suggesting that the outcome is not certain.\n\n## Implementation Details\nIf approved, the measure would take effect on January 1, 2028, and would apply to elections for federal and state offices, including the president, U.S. senator, U.S. representative, governor, and other state executive offices. It would also allow local governments to adopt RCV for local elections unless preempted by home rule charters. The secretary of state would be required to establish a voter education program about RCV.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\nWhile there are no previous statewide ballot measures in Oregon specifically on RCV, other jurisdictions that have implemented RCV have seen mixed public reactions and varying levels of success. Understanding the experiences of these other jurisdictions could provide some context, but the specific outcome in Oregon would depend on local factors and voter sentiment.\n\n## Time to Resolution\nThe measure will be decided in the November 2024 elections, so the time to resolution is imminent.\n\nGiven the split public opinion and the lack of a clear majority in recent polls, it is not possible to definitively answer whether Oregon voters will approve Measure 117 as a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" without further data or polling results closer to the election date. The outcome remains uncertain and will depend on various factors, including voter education, campaign efforts, and final voter sentiment.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent public opinion polls shown a majority of Oregon voters supporting Measure 117?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not include recent public opinion polls or specific data on the current level of support for Measure 117 among Oregon voters. Therefore, it is unclear whether a majority of Oregon voters support Measure 117 based on the available information.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has ranked-choice voting been successfully implemented in any cities or counties in Oregon?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nRanked-choice voting has been successfully implemented or is in the process of implementation in several cities and counties in Oregon. For example, Corvallis and Benton County are already using ranked-choice voting for their local elections.\n\nAdditionally, Portland and Multnomah County voters have approved the transition to ranked-choice voting, with implementation set to begin in the November 2024 elections.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout in the 2024 Oregon general election expected to be high?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is an indication that election officials anticipate high voter turnout for the 2024 Oregon general election.\n\n- An article from Yahoo News states that \"Oregon election officials anticipate high turnout in 2024 presidential ... With one week before Election Day, over half a million Oregonians have already cast their ballots\".\n- Another source mentions that the early voter turnout is falling between the levels of the 2020 and 2022 elections, which suggests a significant level of participation.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that there are expectations for high voter turnout.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have similar ranked-choice voting measures been approved in other states recently?\nANSWER: Yes, similar ranked-choice voting measures have been approved in other states recently.\n\n- Alaska adopted a Top-Four Open Primary and Ranked-Choice General Election through a 2020 ballot initiative, which was enacted in 2022.\n- Maine has been using ranked-choice voting since 2018 for certain elections, including federal and state offices.\n- Hawaii also adopted ranked-choice voting for certain elections in 2023.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ranked-choice voting has been implemented in several states prior to the 2024 ballot measures.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there well-funded campaigns actively opposing Measure 117 in Oregon?\nANSWER: There are campaigns and groups actively opposing Measure 117 in Oregon, although the extent of their funding is not explicitly detailed in the sources.\n\n- Several county clerks, 17 out of 36, have endorsed a political action committee that is raising concerns about Measure 117, highlighting issues such as the lack of infrastructure, funding, and potential complexity of the new voting system.\n- Some Republicans, including state Rep. Ed Diehl, have also publicly opposed the measure, citing concerns about its complexity, potential errors, and the need for more evidence to support its implementation.\n- The Oregon Association of County Clerks has expressed significant concerns and has advocated against the measure, emphasizing the need for more involvement and consideration of their perspectives.\n\nWhile these opposition efforts are organized and vocal, the sources do not provide specific details on the funding levels of these campaigns.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Oregon voters historically approved ballot measures related to electoral reforms?\nANSWER: The information provided does not offer a comprehensive history of Oregon voters' decisions on all past ballot measures related to electoral reforms. However, it does mention some current and recent initiatives:\n\n- Oregon voters are currently considering Measure 117, which would implement ranked choice voting for federal and statewide races by 2028.\n- There is no detailed historical context in the sources provided about the outcomes of previous electoral reform measures.\n\nGiven the lack of historical data in the sources, the answer to whether Oregon voters have historically approved ballot measures related to electoral reforms is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Measure 117 endorsed by major political parties or influential politicians in Oregon?\nANSWER: Measure 117, the Ranked-Choice Voting for Federal and State Elections Measure, has support from various groups and individuals, but the specific endorsement by major political parties or influential politicians in Oregon is not fully detailed in the sources provided.\n\n- The measure was put on the ballot by the Oregon state legislature, with the vote being largely along party lines, except for one Republican who joined the Democrats in support.\n- House Speaker Dan Rayfield (D-16) is quoted as supporting the measure, indicating some level of support from Democratic leadership.\n- However, there is no explicit mention of endorsements from the major political parties as a whole or from a broad range of influential politicians.\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there well-funded campaigns actively supporting Measure 117 in Oregon?\nANSWER: Yes, there are well-funded and actively supported campaigns for Measure 117 in Oregon. Here are some indicators of this support:\n\n- Measure 117 has been endorsed by over 130 organizations across Oregon, including Native-led nonprofits like NAYA Action Fund and Tribal Democracy Project, as well as other groups such as the League of Women Voters of Oregon and the Oregon American Civil Liberties Union.\n- The measure has the support of top Democrats, including then-Speaker Dan Rayfield and Majority Leader Julie Fahey, who helped pass the bill that placed the measure on the November 2024 ballot.\n- Proponents of the measure have met with various county clerks and statewide elections officials multiple times to discuss the ranked-choice voting legislation, indicating a significant effort and resources dedicated to the campaign.\n- The campaign includes organizations like the Next Up Action Fund, which is actively campaigning for the measure.\n\nThese points suggest that there is substantial support and resources behind the campaigns advocating for Measure 117.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant media coverage in Oregon favoring Measure 117?\nANSWER: The media coverage of Measure 117 in Oregon is extensive, but it does not uniformly favor the measure. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- There are several articles and reports from reputable sources such as KGW, OPB, and the Oregon Capital Chronicle that provide detailed explanations and debates on Measure 117, indicating significant media coverage.\n- Supporters of Measure 117, including state representatives and advocacy groups like Oregon Ranked Choice Voting Advocates, are quoted in these articles, presenting their arguments in favor of the measure.\n- However, these same sources also include opinions and concerns from opponents, such as the Equal Vote Coalition and the Oregon Association of County Clerks, who raise issues about the complexity and potential drawbacks of ranked-choice voting.\n\nGiven that the media coverage includes both supportive and opposing views, it is not accurate to say that the media coverage is uniformly in favor of Measure 117. Instead, it reflects a balanced presentation of the debate.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do Oregon voters perceive ranked-choice voting as a positive change to the electoral system?\nANSWER: The perception of ranked-choice voting (RCV) among Oregon voters is not uniformly clear from the available sources, as it reflects both support and opposition.\n\n### Support\n- Many supporters, including Oregon House Speaker Dan Rayfield, the ACLU of Oregon, and various advocacy groups, argue that RCV will give voters more choice, encourage voter engagement, and strengthen democracy by improving people's perception of elections and election outcomes.\n- Proponents also highlight that RCV can lead to more positive and civil campaigns, better representation of diverse backgrounds and ideologies, and higher voter satisfaction.\n\n### Opposition\n- Opponents, such as State Rep. E. Werner Reschke and the Oregon Association of County Clerks, argue that RCV could make elections more complicated, potentially discouraging voting due to longer and more complex ballots.\n- Some opponents also raise concerns about the logistical and fiscal impacts of implementing RCV, as well as potential voter confusion.\n\nGiven the mixed views and the lack of specific polling data on how Oregon voters as a whole perceive RCV, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of the provided date (October 30, 2024), the general election in Oregon is scheduled for November 5, 2024. Therefore, there is approximately **one week** left until the outcome of Measure 117 is known.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and Election Day, the outcome remains uncertain due to mixed public opinion and the lack of clear majority support in available data up to my knowledge cutoff in October 2023. Given the factors involved, Measure 117 would have a moderate chance of approval but is not guaranteed to pass.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only a quarter of the time left (approximately **one to two days** before the election), and assuming no significant developments, I would forecast a probability of **45%** that Measure 117 will be approved.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were four times the time left (approximately **four weeks** until the election), this additional time could allow for more campaigning and voter education. In that case, I would forecast a slightly higher probability of **55%** that Measure 117 will be approved.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Support and Opposition:**\n  - **Support:** Measure 117 has backing from various advocacy groups, some Native organizations, and certain Democratic leaders. The support includes endorsements from over 130 organizations, indicating a strong coalition in favor.\n  - **Opposition:** There is notable opposition from county clerks, some Republicans, and groups concerned about the implementation complexities and potential voter confusion.\n\n- **Public Opinion and Voter Sentiment:**\n  - As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there is no clear consensus among Oregon voters regarding Measure 117. The available information suggests mixed opinions.\n  - Historical trends show that electoral reforms can face significant challenges due to voter unfamiliarity and resistance to change.\n\n- **Implementation in Oregon:**\n  - Ranked-choice voting has been adopted in some Oregon localities, such as Corvallis and Benton County, which could serve as positive examples and increase voter confidence in the system.\n  - The successful implementation at the local level may sway voters to support statewide adoption.\n\n- **Base Rates and Trends:**\n  - States like Maine and Alaska have successfully implemented ranked-choice voting, indicating a growing acceptance of the system in the U.S.\n  - However, not all measures pass simply because of trends elsewhere; local factors and campaign effectiveness are crucial.\n\n- **Time Factors:**\n  - **With less time left (c):**\n    - Voter opinions are more solidified, and significant shifts are less likely.\n    - The effectiveness of last-minute campaigning is limited.\n    - A probability of 45% reflects the uncertainty and slight disadvantage due to lingering doubts among voters.\n  - **With more time left (d):**\n    - Additional time allows for more comprehensive voter education and campaigning.\n    - Proponents can address concerns and misconceptions.\n    - A probability of 55% accounts for the potential positive impact of extended advocacy efforts.\n\n- **Other Considerations:**\n  - Voter turnout is expected to be high, which can influence the outcome. Higher turnout can benefit electoral reform measures if younger and more progressive voters participate in larger numbers.\n  - The lack of recent polling data makes it challenging to predict voter behavior accurately.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 45%**",
