    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill SpaceX fail to make any new posts on its Updates page before January 1, 2025? \n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at SpaceX's Updates page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.spacex.com/updates/), timestamped after the close of this question and before January 1, 2025. If there is no such post, this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other web address than the one mentioned will count. If the web page is down when a Metaculus Admin attempts to access it, this question resolves as No--forecasters are therefore encouraged if they think there is a material chance of the page being down to incorporate that into their forecast.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of November 22, 2024, SpaceX's most recent post was timestamped September 10, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether SpaceX will fail to make any new posts on its Updates page before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Frequency of Updates\n- SpaceX regularly updates its website with news about its missions, test flights, and other significant events. For example, recent updates include the Starship flight tests, Falcon 9 launch anomalies, and partnerships with other space companies[5].\n\n## Ongoing Activities\n- SpaceX is currently engaged in several active projects, including the Starship development program, which involves frequent test flights and updates. The fifth flight test of Starship was recently scheduled, and subsequent tests are likely to follow[1][2].\n- The company is also involved in other ongoing missions and programs, such as the Polaris Program, Axiom Space missions, and the Artemis Program, which are likely to generate updates[5].\n\n## Regulatory and Environmental Reviews\n- SpaceX is in the process of undergoing environmental reviews for increasing the launch rate of Starship from its Starbase test site. This process, which includes public comment periods and meetings, could lead to updates on the company's website[4].\n\nGiven these points, it is unlikely that SpaceX will fail to make any new posts on its Updates page before January 1, 2025, due to the ongoing nature of their projects and the frequency with which they update their website.\n\n### Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- Historically, SpaceX has maintained a high rate of activity and communication through its website.\n- The time frame between now and January 1, 2025, is sufficient for multiple updates to be posted, considering the pace of their current projects.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The space industry is dynamic, and companies like SpaceX are continually involved in new developments, tests, and missions.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Other space companies and organizations also regularly update their websites with new information, and SpaceX follows a similar pattern.\n\nBased on this information, it is reasonable to expect that SpaceX will continue to post updates on its website before January 1, 2025. Therefore, the answer to whether SpaceX will fail to make any new posts is likely \"no.\"\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has SpaceX recently announced any changes to their website update policies?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of SpaceX announcing any changes to their website update policies.

    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nFrom November 25, 2024, to January 1, 2025, there are **36 days** remaining.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends and activities continue without significant disruptions, the outcome would likely be **No**—meaning SpaceX would post new updates on its Updates page before January 1, 2025.\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only **9 days** remaining, the probability that SpaceX fails to post any updates would be slightly higher due to the compressed timeframe. However, given the ongoing projects and scheduled missions, the likelihood remains low. **Forecast Probability: 5%**\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nEven though the deadline is fixed, considering a hypothetical situation with **144 days** would typically allow ample time for multiple updates. This reinforces the expectation that SpaceX would maintain their update schedule. **Forecast Probability: 2%**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nSpaceX is actively engaged in numerous high-profile projects and missions, including multiple scheduled launches and collaborations with major companies like Apple and Amazon. The presence of these activities almost guarantees that there will be significant developments warranting updates on their official Updates page. Despite the last update being over two months ago (September 10, 2024), the upcoming missions and regulatory meetings increase the likelihood of new posts. Additionally, the base rates indicate that SpaceX maintains a consistent communication pattern. While technical issues or unforeseen delays could pose a risk, the comprehensive schedule and active engagement in multiple projects minimize this probability.\n\n**Probability:** **10%**",
