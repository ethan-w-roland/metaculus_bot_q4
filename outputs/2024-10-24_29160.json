{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore December 31, 2024, will Tech Crunch report new layoffs at Google or Alphabet?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-24\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to Tech Crunch's tracker \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs,\" which can be accessed [here](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/11/tech-layoffs-2024-list/), Google (or Alphabet) has layoffs following the launch of this question and before December 31, 2024. To resolve the question, a Metaculus Admin will go to the Tech Crunch link on December 31, 2024, and see if Google or Alphabet appears for October 2024, November 2024, or December 2024. If Google or Alphabet are not listed as having a layoff event under those months, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nAs the parent company of Google, Alphabet is an acceptable synonym for Google. Tech Crunch's \"comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" will be the sole source used for resolution of this question, regardless of information from other sources. If a layoff event appears in the time period listed, this question resolves as Yes, and if not, it resolves as No.\n\nFor ease of resolution, in this series of questions, in order to count the Tech Crunch page must specifically list the company in question, which in this case is Google or Alphabet. This is true regardless of subsidiaries or ownerships. So for example, a question on Microsoft must specifically mention Microsoft, and a layoff event at LinkedIn will not count for purposes of this question (unless the subheading mentions Microsoft), even though LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft.\n\nAccording to Tech Crunch, \"Below you\u2019ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2024, to be updated regularly.\" Admins to resolve this question will only be looking to see what is on the page at the time of resolution. If Tech Crunch ceases to publish updates on the resolution source following the launch of this question (regardless of what can be found elsewhere on the Tech Crunch website), this question resolves as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nGoogle is most recently listed in July 2024, with the blurb saying, \"Is reportedly making large cuts globally across several of its Cloud teams, including teams focused on sustainability, consulting and partner engineering.\" Google has also been mentioned in May, April, and January.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of TechCrunch reporting new layoffs at Google or Alphabet before December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context\n- Google has been undergoing significant layoffs and restructuring throughout 2024, affecting various divisions including engineering, services, voice assistance, hardware teams, and even specific platforms like YouTube.\n- The company has already laid off over 1,000 employees in multiple rounds this year, and CEO Sundar Pichai has warned staff that more layoffs are expected, although not at the scale of the previous year's reductions.\n\n## Ongoing Restructuring\n- Google has been making organizational changes to become more efficient and align resources with its biggest product priorities. These changes have included role eliminations globally and are expected to continue throughout the year.\n\n## Recent Statements\n- Sundar Pichai's memo to staff indicated that while the scale of layoffs will not be as large as in 2023, some teams will continue to make resource allocation decisions that may impact roles throughout 2024.\n\n## Base Rates\n- Given the frequent reports of layoffs and restructuring at Google in the first half of 2024, it is reasonable to assume that such activities could continue, especially as the company adjusts to new priorities and market conditions.\n\n## Time to Resolution\n- With several months remaining in 2024, there is ample time for additional organizational changes or layoffs to occur and be reported by TechCrunch.\n\nBased on these points, it is highly likely that TechCrunch will report new layoffs at Google or Alphabet before December 31, 2024, given the ongoing nature of the company's restructuring efforts and the recent history of layoffs. However, the exact timing and scale of such layoffs cannot be predicted with certainty.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Google or Alphabet announced any plans for further layoffs after July 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about Google or Alphabet announcing plans for further layoffs after July 2024. The sources discuss layoffs that have occurred up to April 2024 and the general trend of workforce reductions in the tech industry, but they do not provide details about future layoffs beyond July 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Google implemented hiring freezes or additional cost-cutting measures since July 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about Google implementing hiring freezes or additional cost-cutting measures specifically since July 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss layoffs and hiring freezes in general terms and provide historical context, but they do not mention any recent actions by Google after July 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Google's revenue or profit decreased in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the previous quarter?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or information available for the third quarter of 2024 regarding Google's revenue or profit. The latest detailed financial data provided is for the second quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2024, but there is no breakdown or figures given for the third quarter of 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there credible reports or rumors of imminent layoffs at Google or Alphabet since July 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are credible reports of layoffs at Google or Alphabet since July 2024.\n\n- In June 2024, Alphabet initiated a round of layoffs within its cloud unit, affecting teams in sales, consulting, 'go to market' strategy, operations, and engineering. At least 100 positions were eliminated in the cloud unit.\n\n- Additionally, there have been ongoing layoffs at Google since early 2023, with recent cuts including those in the 'Core' organization and other divisions. While the specific reports mentioned are from June, the context indicates that layoffs have been an ongoing process, suggesting that such actions could continue.\n\nThese reports indicate that layoffs have indeed occurred recently and are part of a broader trend of workforce reductions at Alphabet and Google.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Sundar Pichai or other Google executives stated that layoffs have concluded for 2024?\nANSWER: NO, Sundar Pichai and other Google executives have not stated that the layoffs have concluded for 2024. Instead, they have indicated that layoffs will continue throughout the year, although at a lesser scale than in 2023.\n\n- Pichai mentioned that the majority of the layoffs would happen in the first six months of 2024, but there would still be some impact in the second half of the year.\n- He also stated that some teams will continue to make specific resource allocation decisions throughout the year, which may impact some roles.\n- The layoffs are part of an ongoing process to simplify execution, drive velocity, and reallocate resources towards key priorities.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Google undergoing major reorganizations or strategic shifts since July 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the major reorganizations and strategic shifts at Google have been ongoing but do not specifically start or intensify after July 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- Google initiated significant layoffs and reorganizations in 2023 and continued them into 2024, affecting various divisions including core engineering, hardware, sales, advertising, and the YouTube division.\n- The layoffs and reorganizations were part of a broader strategy to simplify execution, reduce bureaucracy, and align resources with the company's biggest product priorities, particularly in the area of AI.\n- These changes were announced and implemented in the first half of 2024, with no specific mention of new major reorganizations or strategic shifts starting after July 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has TechCrunch reported layoffs at other major tech companies since August 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, TechCrunch has reported layoffs at other major tech companies since August 2024.\n\n- For example, TechCrunch reported layoffs at Character.AI, where 5% of the staff were laid off, primarily in marketing and recruitment.\n- They also reported on layoffs at Brave, where 27 employees were laid off, accounting for 14% of the workforce.\n- Additionally, TechCrunch mentioned layoffs at Malwarebytes, where 100 positions were cut as part of a plan to separate the business into two units.\n- Other reports include layoffs at Formlabs, where around 40 employees were laid off over the past two years.\n\nThese reports indicate that TechCrunch has been actively covering layoffs at various tech companies since August 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an increasing trend of layoffs in the tech industry from August to October 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if there is an increasing trend of layoffs in the tech industry from August to October 2024, we need to examine the number of layoffs reported during these months.\n\n- **August 2024**: There were significant layoffs reported, with 26,024 employees laid off across various tech companies.\n- **September 2024**: The number of layoffs was lower, with 3,765 employees laid off.\n- **October 2024**: While the sources do not provide a comprehensive total for October, they do mention several companies undergoing layoffs, but the overall numbers for October are not as high as those in August. For example, specific layoffs mentioned include Meta, CapWay, Gigamon, and ByteDance, among others, but these do not add up to the large numbers seen in August.\n\nBased on the available data, there is no indication of an increasing trend from August to October 2024. Instead, the number of layoffs appears to have decreased from August to September.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Google faced significant financial or regulatory challenges since July 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nSince July 2024, Google has faced several significant financial and regulatory challenges:\n\n- Google has been involved in a landmark antitrust lawsuit where a federal judge ruled that the company has violated U.S. antitrust laws with its search operations, declaring Google a monopolist and ordering potential penalties and changes to its business practices.\n\n- The Department of Justice (DOJ) and attorneys general from several states have sued Google over allegations of creating a monopoly in the digital advertising market. This case, which began in early September, seeks to force Google to divest from its Ad Manager suite.\n\n- Google's stock price dropped significantly following reports that the DOJ might consider breaking up the company due to its alleged illegal monopoly in the search engine market.\n\n- Google has also faced other legal challenges, including a $700 million settlement for an antitrust lawsuit related to its app store, and ongoing investigations and lawsuits in Europe regarding its ad tech practices.\n\n- Additionally, Google is preparing to defend itself against antitrust charges related to its acquisition of DoubleClick and other ad tech firms, further highlighting the regulatory pressures it is under.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Google historically avoided layoffs in the last quarter of the year?\nANSWER: No, Google has not historically avoided layoffs in the last quarter of the year or any specific time frame recently. Here are some points that indicate this:\n\n- In January 2023, Google laid off 12,000 employees, which was a significant reduction in its workforce.\n- Throughout 2023 and into 2024, Google has continued to make various rounds of layoffs across different divisions, including core engineering, Google Assistant, and hardware teams.\n- There have been reports of layoffs every single month across various teams for over a year, indicating that layoffs are not confined to any specific quarter.\n- In January 2024, Google initiated another round of layoffs, and CEO Sundar Pichai announced that more layoffs were coming, affecting teams in sales, advertising, product, and the YouTube division.\n\nThese instances show that Google has not avoided layoffs in the last quarter of the year or any other specific period.", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately **68 days** remaining until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changes between now and December 31, 2024\u2014meaning no new layoffs at Google or Alphabet are reported by TechCrunch in October, November, or December 2024\u2014then the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only about **17 days** left (a quarter of the remaining time), the probability of TechCrunch reporting new layoffs at Google or Alphabet before the deadline would be **lower**, due to the shorter time frame for such an event to occur and be reported.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **272 days** remaining (four times the current time left), extending the deadline to around July 2025, the probability would be **higher** that TechCrunch would report new layoffs at Google or Alphabet before the deadline.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Historical Layoff Frequency at Google:**\n\n   - **2024 Layoffs:** TechCrunch reported layoffs at Google in **January**, **April**, **May**, and **July** 2024.\n   - This indicates an average of approximately one report every **two months** in the first half of 2024.\n   - **No Reports Since July:** There have been no reports of layoffs at Google or Alphabet by TechCrunch in **August**, **September**, or **October** 2024.\n\n2. **Time Frame Consideration:**\n\n   - With just over **two months** remaining until the end of the year, there is still sufficient time for new layoffs to occur and be reported.\n   - However, the absence of reports in the last three months suggests a potential slowdown in layoffs at Google.\n\n3. **Industry Trends:**\n\n   - **Decreasing Layoffs:** The tech industry has seen a decrease in layoffs from **August** (26,024 employees) to **September** (3,765 employees) 2024.\n   - This downward trend may continue, potentially reducing the likelihood of new layoffs at Google.\n\n4. **Financial and Regulatory Challenges:**\n\n   - **Significant Challenges:** Google is facing major antitrust lawsuits and regulatory pressures since **July 2024**.\n   - **Potential Impact:** These challenges may prompt Google to implement cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, to address financial strains.\n\n5. **Statements from Leadership:**\n\n   - **No Conclusion of Layoffs:** CEO Sundar Pichai and other executives have not stated that layoffs have concluded for 2024.\n   - **Indications of Ongoing Restructuring:** Pichai indicated that some teams would continue to make resource allocation decisions throughout the year that may impact roles.\n\n6. **Base Rates and Probabilities:**\n\n   - **Historical Base Rate:** With four layoffs reported in the first seven months, the base rate was approximately 57%.\n   - **Adjusted Base Rate:** Considering no layoffs reported in the last three months, the recent base rate decreases.\n\n7. **Potential Counterarguments:**\n\n   - **No Credible Reports of Imminent Layoffs:** The subquestion regarding credible reports or rumors of imminent layoffs since July 2024 is answered as **YES**, but the supporting information references events from **June**.\n   - **Unclear Future Actions:** Without concrete evidence of upcoming layoffs, the probability may be lower.\n\n8. **Overall Assessment:**\n\n   - **Balancing Factors:** The financial pressures and lack of closure on layoffs suggest potential for more layoffs, while recent trends and lack of reports suggest otherwise.\n   - **Uncertainty:** Given mixed signals, there is significant uncertainty in forecasting the outcome.\n\n---\n\n**Final Probability Estimate:**\n\nConsidering the factors above, I estimate the probability that TechCrunch will report new layoffs at Google or Alphabet before December 31, 2024, as:\n\n**Probability: 45%**", "probability": 45}
