    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Planet Nine be discovered before 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nFor this question to resolve positive, the new Solar System planet must be detected by direct optical observation. The planet should have an inferred radius larger than that of Earth, and an orbital period greater than 5,000 years. If this does not happen before January 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n*Note: question text is copied directly from [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4741/will-planet-nine-be-discovered-by-mid-2021/). This version has an extended resolution date.*\n\n---\n\nIn early 2016, two Caltech Professors -- Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown -- created a major media splash by predicting the existence of [Planet Nine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Nine), a new, but as-yet unseen planet in the outer solar system. As originally envisioned, their trans-Neptunian world has an orbital period of about 20,000 years and a super-Earth mass more than sufficient to bring the Solar System's planetary inventory back up to nine.\n\n[Batygin and Brown's paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-6256/151/2/22), has been downloaded well over half a million times, and presents indirect dynamical evidence for the planet's existence. Its presence is inferred through the gravitational sculpting that it has produced in the trajectories of the most distant Pluto-like worlds that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.\n\n[Follow-up papers](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016AJ....151...22B/citations) by a range of authors have added a mixture of credibility, detail, and skepticism to the Planet Nine hypothesis. In the years since the announcement of the hypothesis, Planet Nine has been invoked as an [explanation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04992) for the generation of highly inclined Kuiper belt objects such as Drac and Niku, it has been argued that it [can account for curious orbital commensurabilities](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...91M/abstract) among the most distant members of the Kuiper Belt, and it has been [hypothesized that it can explain](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017AJ....153...27G/abstract) the 6-degree tilt of the planetary orbits relative to the Sun's equator.\n\nThe planet, however, remains to be found.\n\nIf it does exist, its most likely sky location is probably in one of the two regions of the sky where the Galactic Plane intersects the ecliptic. Confusion from the myriad stars of the Milky Way's disk renders systematic searches difficult in these areas. Nonetheless, new techniques, such as the [use of data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06383) from NASA's TESS Mission may potentially provide a breakthrough. Additionally, Batygin and co-authors have published [an update](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10103) to their original paper that contains a significant amount of new analysis and remains optimistic regarding the prospects for eventual detection.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nThe discovery of Planet Nine before 2025 is uncertain and depends on several factors:\n\n## Current Status\nPlanet Nine has not yet been discovered, and its existence is still a topic of debate within the scientific community. The hypothesis of Planet Nine was proposed by Caltech astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Michael Brown in 2016 to explain the unusual orbital patterns of certain trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) in the Kuiper Belt[2][3][4].\n\n## Ongoing and Upcoming Searches\nSeveral powerful telescopes, including the Keck and Subaru telescopes, and citizen science projects like Backyard Worlds: Planet 9, have been searching for Planet Nine. However, these efforts have not yet yielded a definitive discovery[3].\n\n## Vera C. Rubin Observatory\nThe most promising upcoming resource for the search is the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is set to begin operations in 2025. This observatory will conduct a 10-year survey of the Southern Hemisphere sky and is expected to have the capability to detect objects as faint and distant as Planet Nine. While it may provide conclusive evidence for or against the existence of Planet Nine, it is unlikely to do so before 2025[2][3][4].\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the current state of the search and the timeline for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, it is highly unlikely that Planet Nine will be discovered before 2025. The discovery, if it happens, is more likely to occur after the observatory begins its operations. Therefore, the answer to whether Planet Nine will be discovered before 2025 is likely \"no,\" but it cannot be definitively confirmed until the relevant searches are completed.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Vera C. Rubin Observatory begun its survey?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe Vera C. Rubin Observatory has not yet begun its survey. According to the sources, the first light for the engineering camera is expected in August 2024, and full survey operations are aimed to begin in August 2025[3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has NASA's TESS mission data indicated the presence of a new planet in the outer solar system?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources provided do not indicate that NASA's TESS mission has discovered a new planet in our outer solar system. Instead, TESS is focused on discovering exoplanets, which are planets outside our solar system, particularly around the brightest dwarf stars in the sky[1][3][5]. There is no mention of discoveries within our own solar system.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any sources from the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project identified Planet Nine?\nANSWER: No, the sources from the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project have not identified Planet Nine. The project is focused on discovering new brown dwarfs and other faint objects, and while it aims to detect objects that could potentially include the hypothesized Planet Nine, there is no mention in the provided sources of any successful identification of Planet Nine[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the Keck or Subaru telescopes reported any direct optical detections of Planet Nine?\nANSWER: No, the Keck or Subaru telescopes have not reported any direct optical detections of Planet Nine. The sources indicate that while these telescopes, along with other observational efforts, are actively searching for Planet Nine, the planet has not yet been directly observed. The evidence for Planet Nine is currently based on mathematical modeling, computer simulations, and the observed effects on the orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Vera C. Rubin Observatory detected any new planets since its operations started?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided discuss the potential and capabilities of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, including its upcoming operations and the expectations for what it might discover, such as potentially hazardous asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects, and even the hypothetical Planet Nine. However, none of the sources indicate that the observatory has already detected any new planets since its operations have not yet begun; it is set to start in late 2025[2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a current consensus among astronomers supporting the existence of Planet Nine?\nANSWER: There is no current consensus among astronomers supporting the existence of Planet Nine. The hypothesis of Planet Nine is still a topic of debate and ongoing research.\n\n- Some studies suggest that the clustering of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) could be explained by a large, unseen planet, but other analyses have questioned the validity of this clustering, suggesting it might be an illusion or due to observational biases[2][4].\n- Different researchers have varying opinions on the strength of the evidence, with some, like Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown, remaining optimistic about the existence of Planet Nine, while others, such as Kevin Napier and Jean-Marc Petit, express more skepticism and highlight the need for further evidence[2][3][4].\n- The search for Planet Nine continues, with new surveys and telescopes expected to provide more data, but as of now, there is no consensus on its existence[3][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any other observatories besides Vera C. Rubin made significant progress in the search for Planet Nine?\nANSWER: Yes, other observatories besides the Vera C. Rubin Observatory have made significant progress in the search for Planet Nine.\n\n- Researchers have used data from the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) at Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii to analyze thousands of images along Planet Nine's proposed orbital pathway. This work has helped rule out around 78% of the suspected orbital pathway as possible hiding places for the planet[5].\n- The Subaru Telescope, located on Hawaii’s dormant volcano Mauna Kea, has also been utilized in the search. It is one of the best current options available and has been allocated a few nights a year for this purpose[2][5].\n- Additionally, NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has been mentioned as a potential tool that could catch sight of Planet Nine, although its primary focus is on searching for planets orbiting other stars[2][4].\n\nThese efforts, while not yet resulting in the direct observation of Planet Nine, have contributed to refining the search area and understanding the potential orbit and characteristics of the hypothetical planet.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Konstantin Batygin or Mike Brown published any new findings confirming the existence of Planet Nine?\nANSWER: Yes, Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown have published new findings that provide additional evidence for the existence of Planet Nine, although they do not constitute a definitive confirmation of its existence.\n\n- Recent studies by Batygin, Brown, and their colleagues have analyzed the movements of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and extreme TNOs (ETNOs), showing that the observed behavior of these objects can be best explained by the gravitational influence of a large, distant planet, which they refer to as Planet Nine[1][3][5].\n- The researchers have found that the clustering and orbital patterns of these TNOs are consistent with the predictions made by the presence of Planet Nine. For example, the bunching of small objects beyond Neptune's orbit and the tilt of their orbits off the plane of the ecliptic are seen as strong indicators of Planet Nine's gravitational influence[3][5].\n- While these findings are statistically significant and support the hypothesis of Planet Nine, the researchers emphasize that more definitive evidence is needed, which they hope to obtain with the upcoming operations of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any technological advancements that improve the chances of detecting Planet Nine before 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several technological advancements and innovative strategies that are improving the chances of detecting Planet Nine before 2025.\n\n1. **Occultation Array**: A new proposal involves building an array of 200 small telescopes spaced 5 kilometers apart to detect occultations, which could help map the orbits and sizes of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and potentially find evidence of Planet Nine[1].\n\n2. **Vera C. Rubin Observatory**: This observatory, set to begin operations soon, will conduct a decade-long survey of the southern sky with the world’s largest digital camera, which is one of the most promising tools in the search for Planet Nine[5].\n\n3. **Advanced Telescopes and Instruments**: The use of powerful telescopes like the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii and the development of more sensitive instruments are aiding in the systematic survey of large regions of the sky to search for Planet Nine[3][4].\n\n4. **Refined Models and Predictions**: Researchers are continually refining their models and predictions, narrowing down the possible location of Planet Nine and eliminating large swaths of the sky where it is unlikely to reside. This process of elimination brings them closer to either confirming the planet’s existence or ruling it out entirely[5].\n\nThese advancements and strategies are collectively enhancing the likelihood of detecting Planet Nine in the near future.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any new evidence emerged that strengthens the gravitational evidence for Planet Nine's existence?\nANSWER: Yes, new evidence has emerged that strengthens the gravitational evidence for Planet Nine's existence.\n\nSeveral recent studies and observations have provided additional support for the hypothesis of Planet Nine. Here are some key points:\n\n- A newly released study has analyzed the orbits of 13 large extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) and found clustering and tilting of their orbits that can be explained by the gravitational influence of Planet Nine[1][3][5].\n- The new data show that the perihelia (the points of closest approach to the Sun) of these objects vary in a way that is consistent with the gravitational pull of a massive, distant planet[1][3][5].\n- Simulations with and without the hypothesized Planet Nine have been conducted, and the simulations including Planet Nine better match the observed behavior of the ETNOs[3][5].\n- The discovery of a population of objects with orbits twisted by about 90° from the plane of the solar system, which is nearly impossible to explain without the existence of Planet Nine, adds further evidence[1].\n- The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to provide even more definitive evidence, as it will be capable of surveying the entire southern sky and potentially locating Planet Nine within a year or two[1][3][5].\n\nThese findings collectively strengthen the case for the existence of Planet Nine based on its gravitational influence on the orbits of distant solar system objects.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 1 month and 13 days (from November 19, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions remain unchanged over the next 45 days, Planet Nine will **not** be discovered before January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about 11 days remaining, the probability of discovering Planet Nine would decrease further, approaching near certainty that it will **not** be found within such a short timeframe.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith approximately 6 months remaining, there would be a slight increase in the probability of discovery. However, given the current state of searches and the time required for such a significant astronomical discovery, the probability would still remain low, though somewhat higher than the current estimate.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Current Search Efforts:**  \n   - **Telescopes and Observatories:** As of November 2024, major observatories like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory have yet to commence operations, with full survey capabilities expected in August 2025. Existing telescopes such as Keck and Subaru have not reported any direct optical detections of Planet Nine.\n   - **Citizen Science Projects:** Initiatives like Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 have not identified Planet Nine to date, and while they continue to refine their search algorithms, no breakthroughs have been reported recently.\n\n2. **Technological Constraints:**  \n   - **Detection Challenges:** Planet Nine is hypothesized to be a distant, faint object with an inferred radius larger than Earth and an orbital period exceeding 5,000 years. Detecting such an object through direct optical observation requires not only advanced technology but also favorable positional alignment, which is unpredictable.\n   - **Upcoming Surveys:** The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is poised to significantly enhance search capabilities, but its full impact will not be realized until its operations are fully underway in mid-2025, beyond the current prediction window.\n\n3. **Scientific Consensus and Base Rates:**  \n   - **Lack of Consensus:** The scientific community remains divided on the existence of Planet Nine, with ongoing debates and research contributing to the uncertainty.\n   - **Historical Discoveries:** Historically, the discovery of new planets within our solar system has been rare and often dependent on serendipitous observational breakthroughs, which are difficult to predict and unlikely within a short timeframe.\n\n4. **Time Constraints:**  \n   - **Short Timeframe:** With only about 45 days left until January 1, 2025, the window for new observations to lead to a definitive discovery is exceedingly narrow. Most major observational campaigns and data analyses require longer periods to yield significant results.\n\n5. **Probability Assessment:**  \n   - **Low Likelihood:** Considering the lack of recent detections, the operational status of major observatories, and the inherent challenges in detecting such a distant object, the probability of Planet Nine being discovered within the next 45 days is extremely low.\n   - **Minimal Chance for Sudden Developments:** While scientific discoveries can sometimes occur unexpectedly, there is no current indication of imminent breakthroughs that would change the probability assessment significantly.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**Probability: 2%**",
