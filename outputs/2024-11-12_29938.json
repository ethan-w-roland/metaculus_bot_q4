    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Federal Register list 1 or 2 executive orders by President Joe Biden for November 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-12\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Federal Register, which can be accessed [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2024), lists 1 or 2 executive orders for President Joe Biden for the month of November 2024. If it lists >0, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Joe Biden's executive orders and actions](https://ballotpedia.org/Joe_Biden%27s_executive_orders_and_actions)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the Federal Register will list 1 or 2 executive orders by President Joe Biden for November 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Availability of Data\nThe Federal Register website, as indicated in the sources, provides detailed information on executive orders signed by the President. However, due to access restrictions, the most current data might not be immediately available without completing the CAPTCHA and requesting access[2][3][4].\n\n## Historical Data\nAs of the available data up to the point of the sources, President Joe Biden signed 13 executive orders in 2024, but these sources do not specify the exact dates of these orders[5].\n\n## Predictive Factors\n- **Base Rate**: The number of executive orders signed by a president can vary widely and is influenced by various factors including policy priorities, legislative environment, and crisis response.\n- **Time to Resolution**: To accurately predict the number of executive orders for November 2024, one would need real-time access to the Federal Register or other reliable sources that update regularly.\n- **Current State of the World**: The current political, economic, and social conditions could influence the number of executive orders issued, but without specific data, this remains speculative.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the current information, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the Federal Register will list 1 or 2 executive orders by President Joe Biden for November 2024. The answer depends on real-time data that is not provided in the sources, and accessing the most current information would require overcoming the website's access restrictions. Therefore, the question cannot be clearly answered as yes or no based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any anticipated events in November 2024 that would likely prompt President Joe Biden to sign more than two executive orders?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information that suggests any particular events in November 2024 would necessarily prompt President Joe Biden to sign more than two executive orders. The sources list various cultural, holiday, and event calendars for November 2024, but they do not provide any indication of events that would require or lead to the issuance of multiple executive orders.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did President Joe Biden sign exactly one or two executive orders in November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is clear that President Joe Biden signed one executive order related to artificial intelligence in October 2023, not in November 2023.\n\n- The executive order on AI was issued on October 30, 2023[1][2][5].\n\nThere is no mention of any executive orders signed by President Biden in November 2023 in the provided sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is President Joe Biden expected to focus primarily on the presidential election in November 2024 rather than signing executive orders?\nANSWER: NO\n\nPresident Joe Biden suspended his 2024 presidential campaign on July 21, 2024, and has since focused on other priorities rather than the election itself. In his interview with CBS News, he mentioned that he made the decision to end his bid for reelection so the Democratic Party could concentrate on preventing Donald Trump from regaining the White House, and he has been involved in supporting other campaign efforts[3]. This indicates that he is not expected to focus primarily on the presidential election as a candidate.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden's administration announced plans for executive orders to be signed in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific announcement or mention of plans for new executive orders to be signed by President Joe Biden in November 2024. The sources discuss executive orders already signed in 2024, ongoing policies, and potential actions Biden could take, but they do not specify any planned executive orders for November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden historically issued one or two executive orders during the month of November in previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, particularly from the list of executive actions by Joe Biden on Wikipedia, we can see several executive orders issued by President Biden in various months, including November.\n\nFor example, in November 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order 14052 on November 15, 2021, related to the implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act[3].\n\nWhile the list does not provide a comprehensive breakdown of every single month, it does indicate that President Biden has issued executive orders in November in previous years. However, it does not specify if he has consistently issued only one or two executive orders in November each year.\n\nGiven the available data, we can confirm that President Biden has issued at least one executive order in November in previous years, but we cannot definitively state the exact number for every November.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**, President Joe Biden has historically issued at least one executive order in the month of November in previous years, but the exact number for each November is not clear from the provided sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent trends of decreasing numbers of executive orders issued by President Joe Biden leading up to November 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if there has been a recent trend of decreasing numbers of executive orders issued by President Joe Biden leading up to November 2024, we need to examine the data on the number of executive orders issued over time.\n\n- As of May 9, 2023, President Biden had signed 118 executive orders[4].\n- In 2024, up to the point of the available data, Joseph R. Biden, Jr., signed 13 executive orders (from EO 14115 through EO 14127)[5].\n\nGiven that the total number of executive orders issued by President Biden has been steadily increasing overall, the specific number of executive orders in 2024 (13 as of the latest data) does not necessarily indicate a decreasing trend. Instead, it shows a continuation of executive orders being issued, although the rate might be slower compared to previous years.\n\nHowever, without more detailed monthly or quarterly data for 2024, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether there is a decreasing trend specifically leading up to November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a historical precedent for incumbents signing fewer executive orders during election months?\nANSWER: While the sources provided do not directly address the specific question of whether there is a historical precedent for incumbents signing fewer executive orders during election months, we can infer some relevant points:\n\n1. **Executive Orders and Presidential Activity**: The sources discuss the general use of executive orders by presidents, including their frequency and types, but they do not specify the timing of these orders in relation to election months[2].\n\n2. **Presidential Transitions and Activity**: The discussion on presidential transitions and the activities of outgoing presidents suggests that presidents may be more active in issuing executive orders and other directives in the period between the election and the inauguration, especially if they are from a different party than their successor. However, this does not directly address the activity during election months[1].\n\nGiven the lack of specific information on the timing of executive orders in relation to election months, we cannot definitively say whether there is a historical precedent for incumbents signing fewer executive orders during these periods.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden's average monthly number of executive orders been more than two during his presidency?\nANSWER: To determine if President Joe Biden's average monthly number of executive orders has been more than two during his presidency, we need to calculate the average number of executive orders per month.\n\nAs of the latest data, Joe Biden has issued a total of 139 executive orders[3].\n\nAssuming Biden has been in office for approximately 3 years and 4 months (from January 2021 to November 2024), we can estimate the total number of months:\n\n- 3 years * 12 months/year = 36 months\n- Plus 4 additional months = 40 months\n\nNow, we calculate the average monthly number of executive orders:\n\n\\[ \\text{Average monthly executive orders} = \\frac{139 \\text{ executive orders}}{40 \\text{ months}} \\approx 3.475 \\text{ executive orders per month} \\]\n\nSince 3.475 is greater than 2, we can conclude that President Joe Biden's average monthly number of executive orders has indeed been more than two during his presidency.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant policy issues pending that would necessitate President Joe Biden signing more than two executive orders in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are several significant policy issues and potential actions that could necessitate President Joe Biden signing more than two executive orders in November 2024.\n\n1. **Climate Action**: Biden has been urged to declare a climate emergency, which would enable him to circumvent Congress and allot additional climate funding. This could involve multiple executive orders to implement various climate-related reforms, such as decarbonizing the maritime industry and banning offshore drilling[1].\n\n2. **Immigration**: Biden has several pending immigration reforms, including fast-tracking citizenship applications, reversing executive orders restricting asylum, and expanding work permits for undocumented immigrants. These actions could each require separate executive orders[1][4].\n\n3. **Criminal Justice and Drug Policy**: Biden is considering legalizing marijuana, which would involve concluding the review process and recommending de-scheduling to federal agencies, as well as pardoning individuals in federal prison for nonviolent drug offenses. These are distinct actions that could require multiple executive orders[1].\n\n4. **Foreign Policy and Cuba Relations**: Normalizing relations with Cuba, including restoring diplomatic ties, removing Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism List, and lifting sanctions, would likely require multiple executive orders[1].\n\n5. **Health Care and Other Domestic Issues**: Biden has ongoing commitments to protect and expand access to health care, address the fentanyl crisis, and take other domestic actions, which could also involve additional executive orders[2][3].\n\nGiven the breadth and complexity of these issues, it is reasonable to conclude that President Biden might need to sign more than two executive orders in November 2024 to address these pending policy matters.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is November traditionally a month with fewer executive orders issued by U.S. presidents compared to other months?\nANSWER: To determine if November is traditionally a month with fewer executive orders issued by U.S. presidents, we need to examine the distribution of executive orders across different months.\n\nWhile the provided sources do not offer a comprehensive monthly breakdown of executive orders for all U.S. presidents, we can look at some specific examples and general trends:\n\n1. **Executive Orders by George W. Bush**: The list of executive orders issued by George W. Bush shows several orders issued in November, but it does not provide a comparative analysis with other months[1].\n\n2. **Executive Orders by Donald Trump**: The list of executive orders by Donald Trump also includes several orders issued in November, but again, it does not provide a comparative analysis[5].\n\nGiven the lack of a comprehensive monthly breakdown in the provided sources, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether November is traditionally a month with fewer executive orders compared to other months.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 1 month, as the final count of executive orders for November 2024 will be available in early December when the Federal Register updates.\n\n(b) If nothing changed from the current trajectory, the outcome would be that President Biden would likely sign more than two executive orders in November 2024, given his historical average and the significant policy issues pending. Therefore, the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n(c) If there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately one week), given that fewer days remain for executive orders to be signed, the probability of exactly 1 or 2 executive orders being listed would be slightly lower. I would forecast a probability of about 20%.\n\n(d) If there was 4x the time left (approximately four months), the uncertainty increases due to potential changes in policy priorities or unexpected events. However, given the average rate and pending issues, I would forecast a probability of about 28%.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nPresident Joe Biden has historically issued an average of approximately 3.475 executive orders per month. The probability of exactly 1 or 2 executive orders being signed in any given month is therefore lower than the probability of more than two executive orders being signed.\n\nMoreover, in November 2024, there are significant policy issues pending that could necessitate the signing of multiple executive orders, as indicated in the subquestions. These include climate action, immigration reforms, criminal justice and drug policy changes, and foreign policy initiatives. Given these factors, it is reasonable to expect that President Biden may sign more than two executive orders in November 2024.\n\nUsing a Poisson distribution with a mean of 3.475, the probability of exactly 1 or 2 executive orders being signed is approximately 29.5%. Considering the specific circumstances of November 2024, such as the significant policy issues, this probability may be slightly lower.\n\nTherefore, considering both the statistical likelihood and the current policy context, I estimate the probability that the Federal Register will list exactly 1 or 2 executive orders by President Joe Biden for November 2024 as **25%**.\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
