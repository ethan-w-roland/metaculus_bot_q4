    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill there be a culturally significant development in aging research before January 1, 2025?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nIn 2019, at a speech at the Foresight Institute, biomedical gerontologist Aubrey de Grey [stated](https://youtu.be/QmoYYewuw-c?t=660):\n\n> I think we are still 15-20 years away [from effective anti-aging therapies] but the anticipation of the therapy by the general public is coming soon, and it is that anticipation that is going to be the point when the shit really hits the fan. If you think about a situation in which less than five years from now [...] in a period of about a week, half of the developed world is going to shift from an expectation that they will live only slightly longer than their parents did, into an expectation that they're going to live far longer than anyone has ever lived.\n\nIf half of the people in the developed world came to believe within a period of a week that effective anti-aging therapies were imminent, this would likely be a culturally significant event, perhaps among the most significant in the 2020's.\n\nThis question resolves positively if any of the terms \"aging\", \"ageing\", \"anti-aging\", \"anti-ageing\", \"longevity\", \"lifespan\", \"rejuvenation\", or \"life extension\" are mentioned as a direct reference to longevity research\\* in any of the following media sources produced before January 1, 2025:\n\n 1. The English Wikipedia's \"In the news\" [section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:In_the_news).\n\n     or\n\n 2. History.com's summary of events for a year in the 2020's.\n\n     or\n\n 3. The transcript for a primary or general presidential election debate in America.\n\nIt also resolves positively if:\n\n 4. A longevity researcher receives Time's Person of the Year for their work on defeating aging.\n\nOtherwise, this question resolves negatively on the 1st of January 2030.\n\nIn case of positive resolution, this question retroactively closes 1 day before the triggering event.\n\n*ETA: 2022-04-08: qualifying primary or general presidential election debates are limited to mainstream debates (i.e., Republican and Democratic primaries + general election debates).*\n\n<small>\n\n\\* \"longevity research\" here means the research comes from a group whose explicit purpose (as defined by their charter, or their about page on their website, or by some official statement made by the organisation which pertains to their research ends) is to slow, halt, or reverse the natural aging process. Examples of research groups which meet this criteria are the SENS Research Foundation and The Sinclair Lab at Harvard.\n\n</small>\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether there will be a culturally significant development in aging research before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Ongoing Research and Initiatives\n- The National Institute on Aging (NIA) is actively supporting and conducting extensive research on global aging, including behavioral and social research, and studies on health disparities among older adults. This ongoing work is likely to continue and may yield significant findings, but there is no specific indication of a major breakthrough before January 1, 2025.\n\n## Upcoming Conferences and Events\n- The \"Aging & Social Change: Fifteenth Interdisciplinary Conference\" is scheduled for October 2025, which is after the specified date. However, this conference may not be the sole indicator of significant developments, as research and findings can be published and announced at any time.\n\n## Funding and Grant Cycles\n- The NIA has several grant cycles and application deadlines in 2025, which could lead to new research initiatives and potentially significant findings. However, the earliest start dates for these grants are in December 2025, suggesting that any major developments from these grants would likely occur after January 1, 2025.\n\n## Historical Context and Trends\n- The history of aging research has seen gradual and incremental advancements rather than sudden, culturally significant breakthroughs. While there have been notable milestones in the past, significant developments often result from long-term research efforts.\n\nGiven this information, it is not clear whether a culturally significant development in aging research will occur before January 1, 2025. The ongoing research and initiatives suggest a continuous effort in the field, but there is no specific indication of an imminent major breakthrough within the specified timeframe.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any longevity researcher been named Time's Person of the Year for 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not mention any longevity researcher being named Time's Person of the Year for 2024.

    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n\n- The earliest the question can resolve positively is **January 1, 2025**, which is approximately **58 days** from today (November 4, 2024).\n- If none of the positive resolution criteria are met by that date, the question remains open until it resolves negatively on **January 1, 2030**, meaning there are potentially **5 years and 2 months** until the outcome is definitively known.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n\n- If nothing changes between now and January 1, 2025, none of the specific positive resolution criteria will have been met.\n- Therefore, the question would remain unresolved until it automatically resolves negatively on January 1, 2030.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n\n- With only a **quarter of the time left** (approximately **14 days** until January 1, 2025), the probability of the positive resolution criteria being met decreases further.\n- Given the tight timeframe, it is less likely that any of the specified events will occur.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n\n- Multiplying the time left by four extends beyond the positive resolution deadline of January 1, 2025.\n- Since the criteria must be met before this date, having more time does not increase the probability of a positive resolution within the required timeframe.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe question hinges on whether specific culturally significant events related to aging research occur before **January 1, 2025**. The criteria for positive resolution are:\n\n1. **Wikipedia's \"In the news\" section** mentions terms related to longevity research.\n2. **History.com's summary of 2024 events** includes direct references to longevity research.\n3. **U.S. presidential debates** feature candidates discussing longevity research using specific terms.\n4. A **longevity researcher receives Time's Person of the Year** for work on defeating aging.\n\nAs of **November 4, 2024**, none of these criteria have been met:\n\n- **Time's Person of the Year** is typically announced in early December. There is a possibility that a longevity researcher could be honored, but historically, this award tends to recognize individuals or groups with widespread impact on current events. While aging research is progressing, there is no strong indication that a researcher in this field is a frontrunner for the award this year.\n  \n- **Wikipedia's \"In the news\" section** reflects significant current events. Unless a major breakthrough occurs that garners substantial media attention in the next two months, it's unlikely that longevity research will be featured.\n  \n- **History.com's summary of 2024 events** will be published after the year ends. For longevity research to be included, an event of considerable historical significance must occur before January 1, 2025.\n  \n- **U.S. presidential debates** have focused on various pressing issues, but there is no evidence that longevity research has become a central topic in the 2024 election cycle.\n\nWhile there have been **significant advancements in aging research** in 2024, such as discoveries by the Scripps Research Institute, Harvard University, and the Salk Institute, these developments have not yet translated into the level of cultural significance outlined in the resolution criteria.\n\nAdditionally, even though **public interest** in anti-aging therapies is growing, it hasn't reached the critical mass described by Aubrey de Grey, where \"half of the developed world... within a period of about a week\" shifts their expectations about lifespan.\n\nGiven the limited time remaining before the **January 1, 2025** deadline and the absence of clear indicators that any of the specified events will occur, the probability that the question will resolve positively is low.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
