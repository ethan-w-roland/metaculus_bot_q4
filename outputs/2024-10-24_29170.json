{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill William Ruto cease to be President of Kenya before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-24\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as Yes if according to credible sources William Ruto ceases to be the President of Kenya before January 1, 2025, for any reason including but not limited to resignation,  impeachment, losing an election, or removal from office via a coup. Otherwise, this question resolves as No.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf Ruto is still President of Kenya but another individual takes over temporarily, this will not count as long as Ruto resumes his duties within 30 days. Longer than 30 days will resolve as **Yes**.\n\nIf Ruto ceases to be President and takes another role such as Prime Minister, this question resolves as **Yes**.\n\nIn cases of severe uncertainty causing disagreement among credible sources, Admins will refer to the [UN Heads of State list](https://www.un.org/dgacm/en/content/protocol/hshgnfa) to see if Ruto's name is still listed as President of the Republic of Kenya.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAfter weeks of anti-government protests, the President of Kenya, William Ruto, [fired](https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/africa/kenyas-president-fires-entire-cabinet-intl/index.html) almost his entire cabinet, [saying](https://nation.africa/kenya/news/president-ruto-sacks-entire-cabinet-4687068) he was \"listening keenly to what the people of Kenya have said\" as a concession to protestors. This follows several weeks of nationwide protests so intense they Ruto had to be [barricaded](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/opinion/kenya-protests-politics.html)  into his presidential compound. On June 25, 2024, police [opened fire](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/young-kenyan-tax-protesters-plan-nationwide-demonstrations-2024-06-25/) on protestors attempting to enter the parliament. In total at least [39 people](https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/07/09/kenyas-deadly-gen-z-protests-could-change-the-country) have been killed.  \n\n\nThe protests, which were sparked by unpopular proposed tax hikes. evolved into [demands for Ruto's ouster](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/kenyan-activists-call-fresh-protests-demanding-rutos-resignation-2024-06-28/).

Popular discontent or dissatisfaction with the president's performance does not constitute a legal ground for removal.\n\n## Current Political Climate\nDespite ongoing protests and dissatisfaction with President Ruto's policies, the opposition faces significant hurdles in initiating and completing the impeachment or incapacity removal processes. The government holds a majority in the National Assembly, making it difficult for the opposition to secure the necessary votes to proceed with these processes.\n\n## Impeachment Process\nThe impeachment of a president in Kenya is a lengthy and complicated process. It requires a motion supported by at least 25% of the National Assembly members, followed by a majority vote in the National Assembly and then a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. Given the current political landscape, the opposition's ability to muster the required votes is uncertain.\n\n## Recent Political Developments\nThe recent impeachment and removal of Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, while significant, does not directly impact President Ruto's tenure. Ruto has the power to appoint a new deputy president, and this event does not trigger a process for his own removal.\n\n## Base Rates and Historical Context\nNo Kenyan president has ever been removed prematurely from office. This historical context suggests that the removal of a sitting president is highly unlikely.\n\n## Time to Resolution\nGiven the complexity and the time required for the impeachment or incapacity removal processes, it is unlikely that such a process could be completed before January 1, 2025, especially considering the current political dynamics and the lack of clear legal grounds for removal.\n\nIn summary, based on the current legal framework, political landscape, and historical context, it is highly unlikely that William Ruto will cease to be the President of Kenya before January 1, 2025. However, the answer cannot be definitively stated as \"no\" without considering the unpredictable nature of Kenyan politics and any unforeseen events that might arise.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is William Ruto currently the President of Kenya?\nANSWER: YES, William Ruto is currently the President of Kenya. He was sworn in as the President of Kenya on September 13, 2022, after winning the presidential election held on August 9, 2022.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an active impeachment process against William Ruto in the Kenyan Parliament?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe sources provided do not mention any impeachment process against President William Ruto. They all focus on the impeachment proceedings against Kenya's Deputy President, Rigathi Gachagua.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Kenyan military shown any signs of dissatisfaction with President William Ruto's leadership?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of the Kenyan military showing signs of dissatisfaction with President William Ruto's leadership. The sources focus on the protests, the government's response, and the international reactions, but they do not indicate any internal dissent within the military regarding Ruto's leadership.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any Kenyan president ever been removed from office before the end of their term?\nANSWER: No, any Kenyan president has not been removed from office before the end of their term. According to the sources, while there are legal routes for removing a president, such as through incapacity or impeachment as outlined in the Kenyan constitution, no Kenyan president has ever been removed prematurely from office.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent coup or attempted coup in Kenya during William Ruto's presidency?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of a recent coup or attempted coup in Kenya during William Ruto's presidency. The sources discuss widespread protests and civil unrest in response to the Kenya Finance Bill 2024, as well as Ruto's responses to these protests, but they do not mention any coup or attempted coup in Kenya.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President William Ruto signaled any intention to resign before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that President William Ruto has signaled any intention to resign before January 1, 2025. Despite the ongoing protests and calls for his resignation, Ruto has taken other measures such as dismissing his Cabinet ministers, withdrawing the controversial finance bill, and announcing austerity measures, but he has not indicated a willingness to resign.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there ongoing mass protests against President William Ruto in Kenya?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe sources indicate that mass protests against President William Ruto in Kenya are ongoing. Here are some key points:\n\n- Protests that began in mid-June over a contentious tax bill have continued, with recent demonstrations calling for Ruto to resign.\n- Despite Ruto's concession to scrap the planned tax increase and dismiss his cabinet, protesters have not been satisfied and continue to demand systemic changes to address issues like corruption, unemployment, and the high cost of living.\n- The protests have spread across various parts of the country, including Nairobi and other counties, and have involved a significant number of people, particularly from Generation Z.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the opposition control a majority in the Kenyan Parliament?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the opposition does not control a majority in the Kenyan Parliament.\n\n- The sources indicate that the party or coalition with a majority in both the National Assembly and the Senate can influence the legislative agenda. For instance, President Uhuru Kenyatta\u2019s Jubilee coalition held a majority in both houses since the 2013 general election, allowing them to drive their agenda largely unhindered.\n- As of recent developments, President William Ruto\u2019s Kenya Kwanza Alliance does not have a clear majority, leading to efforts to form post-election agreements with other parties to achieve legislative goals.\n- There is no indication that the opposition currently holds a majority in the National Assembly or the Senate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has William Ruto faced significant health issues that could impact his ability to serve?\nANSWER: The information available does not provide clear evidence that William Ruto has faced significant health issues that could impact his ability to serve as President.\n\n- President Ruto has addressed speculation about his health, attributing his recent weight loss to irregular eating patterns and stress during the 2022 election campaign, and he has resumed his fitness and wellness program.\n- There were rumors and speculations, including a claim by a blogger that Ruto might be suffering from mild leukemia, but these have not been confirmed by official sources or Ruto himself.\n- Ruto has denied any serious health issues and has explained his weight loss in a way that does not indicate a severe health problem.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant legal challenges or court cases against William Ruto that could lead to his removal?\nANSWER: There are several significant legal and political challenges facing President William Ruto, but whether these could lead to his removal is not explicitly clear from the sources provided.\n\nHere are some of the key challenges mentioned:\n\n## Legal Challenges\n- President Ruto is facing multiple court cases, including those related to the impeachment of his deputy, Rigathi Gachagua, where the legality of the impeachment process is being challenged.\n- There are ongoing legal battles over various government initiatives, such as the housing levy, the lease of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Adani Group, and the Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF).\n- The government's tax laws have been struck down by the courts, leading to significant financial and legal implications.\n- The High Court has temporarily suspended the new education funding model and there are disputes over the National Government Constituencies Development Fund (NG-CDF).\n\n## Political Pressure\n- The removal of his deputy, Rigathi Gachagua, through impeachment has added to the political pressure on President Ruto.\n- There is intense political scrutiny and potential backlash from the Mt Kenya region, which could impact his re-election chances in 2027.\n\nHowever, none of the sources indicate that these challenges directly threaten President Ruto's removal from office. The legal and political battles are substantial, but they do not explicitly mention impeachment proceedings or other mechanisms that could lead to his removal as President.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately **68 days** left until January 1, 2025. This equates to about **2 months and one week** from today's date, October 24, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf the current circumstances remain unchanged, **William Ruto would continue to be the President of Kenya** on January 1, 2025. There are no active impeachment proceedings, significant health issues, or military actions indicating an imminent change in leadership.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only **17 days** remaining until the deadline, the likelihood of Ruto ceasing to be president would be even lower due to the limited time for any removal processes to unfold. **Probability would decrease slightly** under this scenario.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nWith **272 days** remaining (approximately **9 months**), there would be more time for potential developments such as legal challenges, health issues, or political shifts. **Probability would increase slightly** in this case due to the extended timeframe allowing for unforeseen events.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Legal and Constitutional Constraints:**\n   - The Kenyan Constitution provides two legal routes for a president's removal: incapacity (Article 144) and impeachment (Article 145).\n   - The impeachment process is complex and time-consuming, requiring:\n     - A motion supported by at least **25% of National Assembly members**.\n     - A majority vote in the National Assembly.\n     - A two-thirds majority vote in the Senate.\n   - Given the current parliamentary composition, the opposition does **not control a majority**, making it challenging to initiate and carry out impeachment proceedings within 68 days.\n\n2. **Current Political Climate:**\n   - **Mass protests** are ongoing, fueled by dissatisfaction with economic policies and governance.\n   - Despite public unrest, there are **no active impeachment processes** against President Ruto.\n   - The recent **dismissal of his Cabinet** and the resignation of the **Police Chief** indicate attempts by Ruto to address public concerns without stepping down.\n\n3. **Base Rates and Historical Precedence:**\n   - No Kenyan president has been prematurely removed from office since the country's independence.\n   - Historical stability in the presidency suggests a low base rate for such an event occurring within the next two months.\n\n4. **Military and Health Factors:**\n   - There are **no clear signs of military dissatisfaction** or intentions to orchestrate a coup.\n   - President Ruto has not exhibited any significant **health issues** that would impede his ability to serve.\n   - Speculations about his health have been addressed publicly, and no credible sources indicate incapacitation.\n\n5. **Time Constraints:**\n   - The limited time frame of **68 days** makes it highly improbable for complex processes like impeachment or constitutional removal due to incapacity to be completed.\n   - Even rapid political developments typically require more time to unfold and reach a resolution.\n\n6. **Unpredictable Events:**\n   - While unforeseen events (e.g., sudden health crises, extreme political upheaval) are always possible, they are inherently low-probability events within a short time frame.\n   - There are currently **no indicators** pointing toward such events occurring imminently.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 5%**", "probability": 5}
