    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of active US oil drilling rigs be less than 585 on December 27, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of active oil drilling rigs is less than 585 on December 27, 2024, according to the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count, which can be accessed at [this](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_rotary_rigs) Ycharts link. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe link will be accessed by Metaculus Admins on or around December 28, 2024. In case of its inaccessibility, the secondary resolution source will be from Baker Hughes itself at [this link](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count). If both resolution links remain inaccessible by the end of the tournament, the question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBaker Hughes [issues](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/) US oil rig counts every Friday, and issued oil rig counts to the petroleum industry since 1944. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the number of active US oil drilling rigs being less than 585 on December 27, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends\n- As of the latest data, the US oil rig count has been relatively stable, with minor fluctuations. For example, as of November 8, 2024, the count was 479 oil rigs, and it has shown a slight decline or remained flat in recent weeks[1][3][4].\n\n## Historical Context\n- The US oil rig count has experienced significant volatility in the past, particularly in response to changes in oil prices and drilling technology. However, recent trends suggest a period of relative stability since July 2024[3].\n\n## Recent Changes\n- The total US rig count, including oil, gas, and miscellaneous rigs, has been decreasing slightly. For instance, the total US rig count dropped from 585 to 584 in the week ending November 15, 2024[3][4].\n\n## Analyst Insights\n- J.P. Morgan analysts have noted that the rig count has been relatively stagnant since July, suggesting that the year-end total may fall slightly short of their initial expectations. However, they remain confident that the current drilling activity will be sufficient to meet their December production targets[3].\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, the US oil rig count has been influenced by oil prices, technological advancements, and economic conditions. Given the current stability and slight declines, it is plausible that the count could continue to decrease or remain stable[1][5].\n\n## Time to Resolution\n- With about six weeks until December 27, 2024, there is time for minor adjustments in the rig count. However, given the recent stability and slight declines, a significant drop below 585 might not be imminent but is still possible.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is difficult to predict with certainty, the current trends and analyst insights suggest that the number of active US oil drilling rigs could potentially be less than 585 by December 27, 2024, due to the ongoing slight declines and stability in the rig count. However, this is not a definitive prediction, and various factors could influence the actual outcome.\n\n### Relevant Details for Superforecasters\n- **Current Level**: 479 oil rigs as of November 8, 2024[1].\n- **Recent Trends**: Stability with minor declines[3][4].\n- **Analyst Confidence**: Confidence in meeting production targets despite slight declines in rig count[3].\n- **Historical Volatility**: Significant past fluctuations in response to oil prices and technology[1][5].\n- **Time Frame**: About six weeks until December 27, 2024, allowing for potential adjustments[3][4].\n\nThese points should help superforecasters make a more informed decision based on current trends and historical context.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the number of active US oil drilling rigs as of November 19, 2024, less than 585?\nANSWER: As of November 19, 2024, the number of active US oil drilling rigs is 478, which is significantly less than 585.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US oil rig count decreased in the month of November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the US oil rig count has decreased in the month of November 2024.\n\nAs of November 15, 2024, the US oil rig count decreased to 478 from 479 in the previous week[1][2]. This indicates a decline within the month of November.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there no anticipated natural disasters or events that could reduce the number of US oil drilling rigs by December 2024?\nANSWER: No, there are anticipated natural disasters or events that could potentially reduce the number of US oil drilling rigs by December 2024.\n\n- Hurricanes, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, pose a significant threat to offshore oil and gas operations. These storms can cause structural damage, spills, and even loss of life, and can disrupt offshore oil production and refinery operations[2][4][5].\n- The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season is forecasted to be especially active, with a high number of named storms and hurricanes predicted, which could impact the oil and gas industry significantly[2][5].\n\nTherefore, natural disasters such as hurricanes could indeed reduce the number of operational US oil drilling rigs by December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been no major policy changes affecting US oil drilling since July 2024?\nANSWER: No, there have been major policy changes affecting US oil drilling since July 2024.\n\n- On April 15, 2024, the Department of Interior announced a final rule from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to update financial assurance requirements for the offshore oil and gas industry, which became effective on June 29, 2024. This rule substantially strengthened the financial assurance requirements to protect taxpayers from covering costs associated with oil and gas facility decommissioning[4].\n\n- Additionally, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has been implementing changes to the oil and gas leasing regulations, including increased bonding requirements for onshore drilling, which were announced in April 2024 and are part of ongoing regulatory updates[3][5].\n\nThese changes indicate significant policy adjustments affecting US oil drilling since July 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US oil rig count remained stable or declined in the past six weeks?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the US oil rig count has experienced minor fluctuations but overall has remained relatively stable with some slight declines over the past six weeks.\n\n- As of November 8, the US oil rig count remained unchanged at 479 rigs[1][5].\n- By November 15, the US oil rig count dropped by one rig to 478 rigs[3].\n- Another report on November 18 confirmed that the US oil rig count had dropped by one more rig to 478 rigs, with a slight adjustment from the previous week[2].\n\nWhile there have been minor declines, the overall trend indicates stability with small adjustments. Therefore, the US oil rig count has not significantly declined but has seen minor reductions over the past six weeks.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been no significant increases in US oil rig counts since July 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there have been some fluctuations and minor increases in the US oil rig counts since July 2024, although these increases are not necessarily significant in the broader context.\n\n- As of August 21, 2024, the oil-directed rigs remained stable at 538[1][2].\n- By September 13, 2024, the US oil rig count increased by five rigs to 488 rigs, marking the first increase in the last five weeks[3].\n- In another period, the Anadarko and Niobrara basins added three rigs each, contributing to a slight increase in the major tight oil basins[3].\n\nWhile these changes indicate some upward movement, they are relatively minor and do not represent a significant overall increase in the context of the total rig count.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**, there have been some minor increases in US oil rig counts since July 2024, although they are not substantial.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been no significant technological advancements that would increase the efficiency of US oil drilling rigs since November 2024?\nANSWER: No, there have been significant technological advancements that have increased the efficiency of US oil drilling rigs, and these advancements continue to be relevant beyond November 2024.\n\nSeveral sources highlight these advancements:\n- Efficiency gains, process improvements, and the adoption of best field practices have allowed oil companies to reduce capital spending while maintaining or increasing well completions[1][2][5].\n- Technological advancements include longer lateral lengths, optimized well spacing, and enhanced fracturing designs, which have contributed to higher well productivity[2][5].\n- The use of techniques such as \"simulfrac\" and \"trimulfrac\" to complete multiple wells at once, and the adoption of electric pumping units, have also led to significant cost savings and efficiency improvements[5].\n- Additionally, advancements in drilling and completion operations, including the use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data, are expected to continue unlocking further efficiency gains[5].\n\nThese advancements indicate ongoing improvements in the efficiency of US oil drilling rigs. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count consistently accessible and up-to-date as of December 27, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count is regularly updated and made available on a weekly basis. Here are some key points:\n\n- The rig count is updated weekly, with the latest data available as of November 15, 2024, in the sources provided[2][3][5].\n- There is no indication in the sources that the updates would stop or become inconsistent.\n- The next release date for the rig count is mentioned as November 22, 2024, suggesting a continuous update schedule[2].\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to infer that the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count would continue to be consistently accessible and up-to-date as of December 27, 2024, assuming the weekly update schedule remains in place.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are US oil prices expected to remain stable or decrease through December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the expectation for US oil prices through December 2024 is not for stability, but rather for potential fluctuations and decreases.\n\n- The EIA forecasts that average Brent oil prices will be around $80.95 per barrel in 2024, but notes that prices are expected to trend lower in the fourth quarter and into 2025 due to various factors, including global oil demand growth being lower than previously forecasted[2][4][5].\n- Goldman Sachs also suggests that oil prices are likely to trade between $70 and $100 a barrel in 2024, but with a potential for short-term volatility and a general expectation of prices not being sustained at higher levels[3].\n- Additionally, the forecasts indicate that after the expiration of OPEC+ voluntary supply cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024, oil prices are expected to decrease as supply growth from non-OPEC countries begins to offset demand growth[1].\n\nTherefore, the overall expectation is that US oil prices are likely to decrease or remain under downward pressure through December 2024.\n\n**NO** (to remaining stable)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there no planned expansions in US oil drilling operations scheduled before December 27, 2024?\nANSWER: No, there are planned expansions in US oil drilling operations scheduled before December 27, 2024. Here are some examples:\n\n- The Permian region is expected to see increased production due to drilling productivity improvements, new and expanded infrastructure, and high crude oil prices. New pipeline capacity, such as the expansion of Enbridge's Gray Oak pipeline and the Matterhorn Express Pipeline, is scheduled to come online before the end of 2024 and in the third quarter of 2024, respectively[4].\n\n- In the Gulf of Mexico, 12 new fields are expected to start production in 2024 and 2025, with some of these fields starting production in 2024. This includes the development of new fields using subsea tiebacks and new Floating Production Units (FPUs)[3].\n\n- Additionally, there are plans for increased rig activity and well completions in various shale regions, including the Permian Basin, which is expected to continue its growth in oil production through the end of 2024[2][4].\n\nThese expansions indicate that there are indeed planned increases in US oil drilling operations before December 27, 2024. .NO",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- Approximately 5 weeks (38 days) remain from November 19, 2024, to December 27, 2024.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- If current trends continue unchanged, the number of active US oil drilling rigs would remain around 478, which is significantly less than 585. **Outcome: Yes**\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- With only about 1.25 weeks left, the rig count is unlikely to change drastically from its current level of 478. The probability that it remains below 585 would remain exceptionally high. **Forecast: Yes**\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- With 20 weeks remaining, there is more time for potential fluctuations. However, increasing the rig count from 478 to 585 (a rise of 107 rigs) within this period is highly improbable given historical trends and current factors. **Forecast: Yes**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Current Rig Count:** As of November 19, 2024, the US oil rig count stands at 478, which is well below the 585 threshold.\n- **Trends:** The rig count has been stable with minor declines recently. Achieving a significant increase of over 100 rigs in a short period is unlikely.\n- **Planned Expansions:** While there are planned expansions, the scale required to reach 585 rigs from the current count is not supported by available data.\n- **External Factors:** Potential natural disasters or policy changes could impact rig counts, but these are not expected to drive the count above 585 within the given timeframe.\n- **Base Rates:** Historically, such large swings in rig counts over approximately five weeks are rare without extraordinary circumstances.\n\nGiven the substantial margin between the current rig count and the target threshold, along with the unlikelihood of rapid increases, the probability that the number of active US oil drilling rigs will be less than 585 on December 27, 2024, is extremely high.\n\n**Probability: 99%**",
