    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill New Zealand report greater than or equal to 275 and less than or equal to 375 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-03\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if the total number of cases reported by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research's Pertussis Dashboard for both weeks 51 and 52, when they are posted is greater than or equal to 275 and less than or equal to 375 .\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- Week 51 ends on December 20, 2024, and the data are expected to be posted on December 25, 2024. Week 52 ends on December 27, 2024, and the data are expected to be posted on January 1, 2025.\r\n- This question will resolve on the first day after January 1, 2025 that data for both weeks are shown on the dashboard. Potential data revisions will not change the resolution. If the relevant numbers are not available on the dashboard before January 7, 2025, Admins may use alternative [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions), as long as their numbers are consistent with the dashboard's numbers.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nWhooping cough is a serious disease. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough):\r\n> Whooping cough also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough, is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable bacterial disease. Initial symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough, but these are followed by two or three months of severe coughing fits. Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in. The violent coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase \"100-day cough\". The cough may be so hard that it causes vomiting, rib fractures, and fatigue. Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods when they cannot breathe.\r\n\r\nOn 22 November 2024, the Ministry of Health of New Zealand [declared](https://www.health.govt.nz/news/whooping-cough-epidemic-declared-across-aotearoa-new-zealand) an epidemic of whooping cough across the country, as cases have been rising with 263 cases over the four weeks from mid October to mid November.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of New Zealand reporting between 275 and 375 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Epidemic Status\n- New Zealand has declared a whooping cough epidemic, with 263 cases reported in the four weeks to November 15, which is the highest number over a four-week period for 2024[3][4][5].\n- The total number of whooping cough cases for 2024 has already surpassed 1,000, with 77 cases reported in the week leading up to November 29[1][5].\n\n## Case Trends\n- The epidemic has shown consistently high case numbers, hospitalizations, and unlinked outbreaks, prompting a national coordinated response[1][3][5].\n- The number of cases reported in the week leading up to November 29 was slightly down from the two weeks prior, but health officials expect the epidemic to be long-lasting, potentially up to 18 months[5].\n\n## Geographic and Demographic Distribution\n- The lower North and South Islands are identified as significant hotspots, with Wairarapa having the highest infection rate at 25.4 cases per 100,000 people[2].\n- Māori and Pacific babies are at particularly high risk, with a significant proportion of those under 12 months old requiring hospitalization[1][4].\n\n## Vaccination Efforts\n- Health agencies are emphasizing the importance of vaccination, especially for pregnant women, newborns, and the extended family of newborns to protect vulnerable groups[1][3][4].\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- The recent trend shows a high but slightly decreasing number of cases in the most recent week reported (77 cases)[1][5].\n- The epidemic is expected to be long-lasting, but the exact weekly case numbers can fluctuate.\n- The total cases for the year have already surpassed 1,000, indicating a significant ongoing outbreak.\n\nWhile it is difficult to predict exact case numbers for specific weeks without more detailed forecasting data, the current trends and the ongoing nature of the epidemic suggest that reporting between 275 and 375 cases for weeks 51 and 52 is plausible. However, this is not a definitive prediction, as case numbers can vary based on various factors including vaccination efforts, public health measures, and community behavior.\n\nTo make a more informed prediction, a superforecaster would need to consider historical data on whooping cough epidemics, the effectiveness of current public health measures, and any changes in community behavior or vaccination rates.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Ministry of Health of New Zealand declared a whooping cough epidemic as of November 22, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 22, 2024, the health authorities in New Zealand, including Health New Zealand and the National Public Health Service, have declared a national whooping cough epidemic due to the high number of cases and hospitalizations reported[3][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the lower North and South Islands of New Zealand experiencing significant hotspots for whooping cough?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe lower North and South Islands of New Zealand are indeed experiencing significant hotspots for whooping cough. According to the sources, health officials have identified hotspots in various regions, including Wairarapa, Southern, Whanganui, and Capital and Coast health districts, which are located in the lower parts of the North and South Islands[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there no significant delays or inaccuracies reported in the reporting of whooping cough cases on the Institute of Environmental Science and Research's Pertussis Dashboard?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not contain specific information about the reporting delays or inaccuracies related to the Institute of Environmental Science and Research's (ESR) Pertussis Dashboard.\n\n- The ESR's Pertussis Dashboard is mentioned in [3], but it does not discuss the accuracy or timeliness of the reporting.\n- The other sources do not address this specific question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have public health agencies in New Zealand reported an increase in vaccination rates among pregnant women and newborns in December 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe provided sources do not contain specific data or reports on vaccination rates among pregnant women and newborns in New Zealand for December 2024. The sources discuss general recommendations and benefits of vaccinations during pregnancy, as well as immunisation coverage data for children, but they do not provide the specific information needed to determine if there was an increase in vaccination rates among pregnant women and newborns in December 2024[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the cumulative number of whooping cough cases in New Zealand up to week 50 of 2024 greater than or equal to 1,000?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific cumulative total of whooping cough cases in New Zealand up to week 50 of 2024. The sources mention that there were 263 cases in the four weeks to November 15, which is the highest number of cases over a four-week period for 2024, but they do not provide a cumulative total for the entire year or up to week 50.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the number of whooping cough cases in the week ending November 29, 2024, been 77 or higher?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the specific number of whooping cough cases for the week ending November 29, 2024, is not provided. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The CDC reported 577 infections of pertussis nationwide for the week ending November 23, 2024, which is around 33% higher than the previous week[1][3].\n- However, none of the sources provide the exact number of cases for the week ending November 29, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a national coordinated response currently in place in New Zealand to address the whooping cough epidemic?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a national coordinated response currently in place in New Zealand to address the whooping cough epidemic. Health officials have declared a national whooping cough epidemic and have put a nationally coordinated response in place due to the high number of cases and hospitalizations across the country[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the trend of whooping cough cases in New Zealand showing a slight decrease in the most recent reported week compared to the two weeks prior?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data comparing the most recent reported week to the two weeks prior in terms of the trend of whooping cough cases.\n\n- The sources mention a high number of cases over a four-week period up to November 15, with 263 cases reported during that time, which is the highest number over a four-week period for 2024[2][3][5].\n- However, they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the cases for the most recent week specifically, or a comparison to the preceding weeks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Māori and Pacific babies in New Zealand experiencing higher hospitalization rates due to whooping cough compared to other demographics?\nANSWER: Yes, Māori and Pacific babies in New Zealand are experiencing higher hospitalization rates due to whooping cough compared to other demographics.\n\nSeveral sources confirm this:\n\n- According to Dr. Nicholas Jones, Māori and Pacific pēpi (babies) are most affected by the whooping cough epidemic, with higher rates of severe illness and hospitalization[2].\n- The Immunisation Handbook by Te Whatu Ora notes that Pacific and Māori infants have the highest notification rates for whooping cough, and their hospitalization rates are significantly higher than those of European/Other ethnicities[4].\n- The ESR report and other sources also highlight that Māori and Pacific infants are at a higher risk of hospitalization due to whooping cough, with rates consistently higher in these groups compared to others[3][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent public health measures introduced in New Zealand aimed at reducing the transmission of whooping cough?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent public health measures introduced in New Zealand aimed at reducing the transmission of whooping cough.\n\n- Health officials have declared a national whooping cough epidemic, triggering a nationally coordinated response. This includes urging pregnant people to get the free Boostrix vaccination from 16 weeks of pregnancy to protect their newborns[2][4][5].\n- There is a strong emphasis on ensuring babies receive their vaccinations on time at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 5 months, and boosters at 4 and 11 years[2][4][5].\n- Free whooping cough vaccines are available to everyone aged 18 and under, and to some adults, particularly those eligible for the combined pertussis and tetanus vaccine[1][4].\n- Community pop-up clinics and immunisation events have been organized to increase vaccination rates, especially among vulnerable groups such as Māori and Pacific communities[1].\n- Healthcare professionals are advised to remain vigilant for symptoms and to promote vaccinations to protect vulnerable groups, including extended whānau of pregnant people and new babies[2][4].\n- Booster vaccinations are recommended for healthcare workers and those in direct contact with infants, with a frequency of 5-10 years depending on employer requirements[2][5].",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 30 days (from December 3, 2024, to January 2, 2025).\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:** If current trends continue without any significant interventions or changes, New Zealand is likely to report fewer than 275 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52 combined. The estimated total would be around 140 cases, which is below the lower threshold of 275.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With only about 7-8 days remaining until the outcome is known, there is limited time for any substantial changes in case numbers. The likelihood of reaching the threshold of 275 cases in such a short period remains low. Therefore, the forecast would still lean heavily towards the outcome being **No**.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was four times the time left:** Extending the timeframe to approximately 120 days would allow for more interventions and potential changes in case numbers. However, since the question specifically pertains to weeks 51 and 52, extending the timeframe doesn't directly impact this outcome. The forecast remains consistent, with the probability still low for reaching the 275-375 case range within the specified weeks.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- **Current Trends:** The epidemic has been significant but shows a slight decrease in recent weeks, with around 70 cases per week. Over two weeks (weeks 51 and 52), this would total approximately 140 cases.\n  \n- **Public Health Interventions:** A national coordinated response is in place, emphasizing vaccination efforts targeted at vulnerable populations. These measures are expected to help control and potentially reduce the spread of whooping cough.\n  \n- **Epidemic Duration:** While the epidemic is projected to be long-lasting (up to 18 months), the immediate trend suggests stabilization or a slight decline in cases, making the higher case range (275-375) unlikely in the short term.\n  \n- **Uncertainty Factors:** Potential factors that could influence the outcome include changes in vaccination rates, public adherence to health measures, and unforeseen outbreaks in hotspots. However, given the current data and ongoing interventions, these factors are unlikely to cause a drastic increase in cases within the specified timeframe.\n\nConsidering the above factors, the probability that New Zealand will report between 275 and 375 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52 is low.\n\n**Probability:** 15%",
