    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on December 20, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after December 20, 2024, after 5:00 PM Eastern Time (i.e., over an hour after the US stock market closes for regular trading). It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\nIf the list contains fewer than 250 people on the resolution date, this question will be resolved as the last person on the list. If it contains more than 500 people, the median will still be considered the 250th. If it contains 251-499 people, the median will still be considered the 250th ranked.\n\nIf Bloomberg's Billionaires Index is unavailable on the resolution date, resolution will wait until it is available (at which point it resolves based on the data shown), until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled. For more details on various edge cases regarding availability of or changes to the resolution source, please see Metaculus's ambiguity and annulment policies [here](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#ambiguous-annulled).  \n\nBACKGROUND:\nOn Nomember 22, 2024, of the 10 individuals ranked 246-255 on Bloomberg's list, 6 were from the United States. On the entire list, 190 out of 500 indivduals were from the United States.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index will be from the United States on December 20, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Current Composition\nAs of the latest updates, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index tracks the 500 richest people in the world. Historically, a significant portion of these individuals have been from the United States. For example, as of March 2024, nine of the 10 richest people in the world were Americans, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index[3].\n\n## Geographic Distribution\nWhile the top 10 richest individuals are predominantly American, the entire list of 500 billionaires includes people from various countries. However, the United States has consistently had a large representation on the list. The index has uncovered and tracks billionaires from around the world, but the U.S. remains a dominant source of wealth due to the presence of major tech companies and other significant corporations[2].\n\n## Dynamic Nature of the Index\nThe Bloomberg Billionaires Index is updated daily, reflecting changes in market values and other economic factors. This means that the ranking and nationality distribution can fluctuate over time. However, given the historical trend and the current dominance of U.S. billionaires, it is likely that a significant number of the top 500 will continue to be from the United States[2][4].\n\n## Median Calculation\nTo determine if the median person will be from the United States, one would need to know the exact distribution of nationalities across the entire list of 500 billionaires. Since the list is dynamic and subject to daily changes, predicting the exact median nationality with certainty is challenging without real-time data.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is highly probable that a substantial number of the top 500 billionaires will be from the United States, given historical trends and current data, it is not possible to definitively state whether the median person on December 20, 2024, will be from the United States without access to the specific distribution of nationalities at that exact time. The answer is not immediately clear and would require real-time data to confirm.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current median rank (250th) on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index held by a U.S. national?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specify the nationality or any details about the individual at the 250th rank on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The information given only lists the top billionaires and the methodology used to calculate their net worth, but it does not provide data on the median rank or the 250th position.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Bloomberg Billionaires Index currently listing more than 250 billionaires from the United States?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specify the exact number of billionaires from the United States listed in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the index does track the world's 500 richest people, it does not provide a breakdown by country in the sources given[2][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any non-U.S. billionaires who have recently surpassed U.S. billionaires in wealth on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically mention the Bloomberg Billionaires Index or compare the wealth of non-U.S. billionaires to U.S. billionaires on this particular index. The information given is based on the Hurun Global Rich List 2024 and other general wealth reports, but it does not address the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent changes to the criteria or methodology of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index that could affect the ranking of U.S. billionaires?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of recent changes to the criteria or methodology of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index that could affect the ranking of U.S. billionaires. The sources describe the existing methodology, which involves daily updates based on stock prices, publicly disclosed holdings, and valuations of private companies, but they do not mention any new or revised criteria or methodologies[1][2][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the number of U.S. billionaires on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index increased in the past year?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specify the exact number of U.S. billionaires on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the past year or any changes in this number. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index tracks the 500 richest people globally, but it does not provide a breakdown of the number of U.S. billionaires specifically in the sources given[2][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the representation of U.S. billionaires on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index expected to grow by December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information that directly addresses whether the representation of U.S. billionaires on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index is expected to grow by December 2024. The sources discuss the current wealth and trends of various billionaires, the impact of recent events like the U.S. election, and predictions for future wealth growth, but they do not provide a clear forecast for the number of U.S. billionaires on the index by the end of 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent significant increases in wealth among U.S. billionaires on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent significant increases in wealth among the world's richest individuals, including U.S. billionaires, as tracked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nFollowing Donald Trump's election win, the net worth of the ten richest people in the world, many of whom are U.S. billionaires, surged by a record $64 billion in a single day. This includes substantial gains for Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Larry Ellison, among others[2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do U.S. billionaires hold a majority of the total wealth represented in Bloomberg's Billionaires Index?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated that U.S. billionaires hold a majority of the total wealth represented in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the sources do list several prominent U.S. billionaires, such as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates, among the top rankings, they do not provide a comprehensive breakdown of the national distribution of wealth among all 500 billionaires listed in the index.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether U.S. billionaires hold a majority of the total wealth is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the technology sector, which is prominent among U.S. billionaires, expected to continue growing through December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the technology sector is expected to show signs of growth through 2024, although the pace and extent of this growth are described with some caution.\n\n- Deloitte's 2024 technology industry outlook indicates that analysts are optimistic about a potential return to modest growth in the tech sector in 2024, with more robust prospects for 2025. Predictions for growth in global IT spending in 2024 range from 5.7% to 8%, and there is expected growth in areas such as cloud, AI, and cybersecurity[1][2].\n\n- EY's report also suggests a brighter outlook for the tech industry in 2024, driven by strategies centered on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and other digital transformation initiatives[3].\n\n- Additionally, forecasts for technology investments in Canada indicate an increase in budgets of 8% in 2024, reflecting greater confidence in the economy[4].\n\nGiven these points, it appears that the technology sector is indeed expected to continue growing through December 2024, albeit with a focus on modest and transitional growth leading to more robust prospects in the following year.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major economic events in the United States that could significantly impact the wealth of U.S. billionaires by December 2024?\nANSWER: Several economic factors and events mentioned in the sources could potentially impact the wealth of U.S. billionaires by December 2024:\n\n## Interest Rate Cuts\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates, with predictions of a 100 basis points cut in 2024 and further cuts in 2025. This could influence borrowing costs, consumer spending, and business investments, which might affect the wealth of billionaires through their various investments and business ventures[1][3][4].\n\n## GDP Growth and Economic Resilience\nThe U.S. economy is forecasted to grow at a rate of around 2.7% in 2024, with varying predictions for subsequent years. This growth, driven by consumer spending, business investment, and government consumption, could positively impact the wealth of billionaires, especially those with significant stakes in these sectors[1][2][3].\n\n## Inflation Trends\nInflation is expected to continue decreasing, with CPI inflation forecasted to be around 2.7% by the fourth quarter of 2024. Lower inflation can stabilize economic conditions and potentially benefit billionaires by reducing costs and increasing the purchasing power of their investments[1][3][4].\n\n## Geopolitical and Trade Policy Risks\nThere are risks associated with geopolitical conflicts and trade policy changes, which could lead to persistent inflation and impact economic growth. These uncertainties could negatively affect the wealth of billionaires, particularly those with international investments or exposure to sectors sensitive to trade policies[1][4].\n\n## Labor Market and Employment\nThe labor market is showing signs of softening, with slower job growth and an increasing unemployment rate. This could impact consumer spending and business confidence, which in turn might affect the wealth of billionaires[1][3][4].\n\n## Post-Election Policy Changes\nThe upcoming policy changes post-election, including deregulation efforts, restrictions on immigration, and increased protectionism, could have mixed effects on the economy and the wealth of billionaires. These changes might boost certain sectors but also introduce new risks and uncertainties[4].\n\nGiven these factors, it is clear that several major economic events and trends could significantly impact the wealth of U.S. billionaires by December 2024.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n21 days (from November 29, 2024, to December 20, 2024).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \n**No.** Currently, 190 out of 500 billionaires on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index are from the United States. If this distribution remains unchanged, the 250th ranked individual would not be from the United States.\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 5 days remaining, there is minimal opportunity for significant changes in the rankings. Therefore, the probability remains low.  \n**Forecast:** 10%\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith around 84 days, there is more time for potential shifts in wealth and rankings, especially given the dynamic nature of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. However, overcoming the existing distribution would require substantial changes, which are not highly probable.  \n**Forecast:** 15%\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe Bloomberg Billionaires Index currently lists 190 U.S. billionaires out of 500. The median position at rank 250 is occupied by a non-U.S. billionaire based on the current distribution. While economic factors such as technology sector growth and potential increases in the wealth of U.S. billionaires could influence rankings, the existing gap makes it unlikely that the median position would shift to a U.S. national within the 21-day window. Even with extended time, significant changes would be necessary to alter the median nationality, keeping the probability relatively low.\n\n**Probability:** 8%",
