    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Climeworks still exist on December 31, 2024?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-09\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\n>Stripe, a financial-services company, [committed last year](https://stripe.com/blog/negative-emissions-commitment) to spending at least $1M/year on negative emissions and carbon storage technologies, at any price, with the aim of helping these technologies develop.\n\n>They recently wrote up [a summary](https://stripe.com/blog/first-negative-emissions-purchases) of their first set of these purchases.\n\n>This miniseries aims to predict the success of the companies that Stripe chose.\n\nStripe has purchased 322.5 tons of negative emissions from Climeworks at $775 per ton.\n\n[Climeworks](https://www.climeworks.com/) uses renewable geothermal energy and waste heat to capture CO2 directly from the air, concentrate it, and permanently sequester it underground in basaltic rock formations with Carbfix. Their own price target in the long-term is $100-$200 per ton.\n\n**This question asks:**\n> On December 31, 2024, will Climeworks still be selling negative emissions using broadly similar technology to their 2020 approach?\n\nThis question resolves positive if [this](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4857/what-will-be-the-cost-of-negative-emissions-sold-by-climeworks-in-2030/) question has an unambiguous resolution. Otherwise, it resolves negative.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBased on the available information, there is no indication that Climeworks will cease to exist by December 31, 2024. Here are some key points that suggest the company's ongoing operations and future plans:\n\n## Ongoing Operations and Expansion\n- Climeworks has recently launched the world's largest direct air capture and storage plant, Mammoth, in Iceland, which is a significant milestone in their scale-up journey[3][5].\n- The company is involved in multiple large-scale projects, including the Direct Air Capture Hub Project Cypress in Louisiana, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy[1][5].\n\n## Long-Term Contracts and Partnerships\n- Climeworks has signed a long-term agreement with Morgan Stanley to remove 40,000 tons of CO₂ from the atmosphere until 2037, which is their second-largest contract to date[1].\n\n## Global Expansion Plans\n- Climeworks is planning to expand its operations globally, with projects in the United States, Norway, Australia, and other locations. They aim to reach megaton carbon removal capacity by 2030 and gigaton scale by 2050[2][5].\n\n## Financial and Regulatory Support\n- The company has received significant funding and support from governments and corporations, which is crucial for their ongoing operations and future growth[1][5].\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that Climeworks is likely to continue existing beyond December 31, 2024. However, the future is inherently uncertain, and unforeseen events could potentially impact the company's viability. But based on the current information, there is no clear indication of its demise by the end of 2024.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Climeworks been involved in any mergers or acquisitions in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of Climeworks being involved in any mergers or acquisitions in 2024.

The company has recently started operations of its largest direct air capture and storage plant, Mammoth, in Iceland, which began operations in May 2024[1][2][5]. This indicates that Climeworks is actively operating its facilities.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Climeworks still operating the Mammoth plant in Iceland in 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nClimeworks has commenced operations at the Mammoth plant in Iceland as of May 2024, and the plant is currently in the process of being completed throughout the year[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Climeworks report financial losses in 2024?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not explicitly mention whether Climeworks reported financial losses in 2024. The information given focuses on funding rounds, partnerships, technological advancements, and operational expansions, but it does not include specific financial performance data such as profits or losses for the year 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Climeworks receive government grants or subsidies in 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nClimeworks, along with its project partners, received an award of more than $50 million from the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) in March 2024 for Project Cypress, a direct air capture (DAC) hub in Louisiana[1][4][5]. This funding is part of the larger Regional DAC Hubs program.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Climeworks launched any new direct air capture projects in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Climeworks has launched new direct air capture projects in 2024.\n\n- Climeworks started operations of its largest direct air capture and storage plant, Mammoth, in Iceland in May 2024. This plant is about ten times bigger than its predecessor, Orca[1][3][4].\n- Additionally, Climeworks announced its Generation 3 direct air capture technology in June 2024, which will be deployed in future projects, including the megaton-scale Project Cypress DAC Hub in Louisiana, with construction set to begin in 2026[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Climeworks still collaborating with Carbfix for CO₂ sequestration in 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nClimeworks is still collaborating with Carbfix for CO₂ sequestration in 2024, as evidenced by several recent sources. For example, the announcement of their collaboration with Puro.earth to certify Climeworks’ DAC+S services under the Puro Standard, which involves Carbfix, was made in September 2023 and indicates ongoing cooperation[4].\n\nAdditionally, the continued partnership for carbon storage through natural underground mineralization is mentioned in other recent sources, such as the one detailing their business breakdown and the process of carbon mineralization[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Climeworks expanded its operations to new countries in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Climeworks has been expanding its operations and developing projects in various countries, but the specific question of new country expansions in 2024 is not directly addressed.\n\n- Climeworks has existing and ongoing projects in several countries including the U.S., Iceland, Kenya, Canada, Norway, and the Middle East, as mentioned in the sources[1][2][4].\n- However, there is no explicit mention of Climeworks expanding into new countries specifically in 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Climeworks has expanded its operations to new countries in 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Climeworks sign any new contracts or partnerships in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nClimeworks signed several new contracts and partnerships in 2024.

    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n22 days (from December 9, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nClimeworks would still exist on December 31, 2024, continuing to sell negative emissions using broadly similar technology to their 2020 approach.\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 5-6 days remaining, the probability remains very high, around **99%**, given the short timeframe and the lack of immediate threats to the company's operations.\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith an extended timeframe of about 88 days, the probability would slightly decrease to around **95%** to account for potential unforeseen challenges that could arise over a longer period.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nClimeworks has demonstrated strong operational momentum as of 2024, marked by significant milestones such as the launch of the Mammoth plant in Iceland and securing substantial contracts and government funding. The company's ongoing partnerships, global expansion plans, and continuous technological advancements bolster its stability and growth prospects. While there are minor uncertainties, such as the lack of explicit financial performance data and no recent mergers or acquisitions, these do not significantly undermine the company's current trajectory. Given the very short remaining time until the outcome date, the likelihood of Climeworks ceasing operations in the next 22 days is exceedingly low.\n\n**Probability: 98%**",
