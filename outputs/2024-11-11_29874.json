    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of active US oil drilling rigs be less than 585 on November 29, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-11\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of active drilling rigs is less than 585 on November 29, 2024, according to the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count, which can be accessed at [this](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_rotary_rigs) Ycharts link. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe total number of active drilling rigs includes the total of those classified as oil, gas, and miscellaneous.  The link will be accessed by Metaculus Admins on or around November 29, 2024. In case of its inaccessibility, the secondary resolution source will be from Baker Hughes itself at [this link](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count). If both resolution links remain inaccessible by the end of the tournament, the question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBaker Hughes [issues](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/) US oil rig counts every Friday, and issued rig counts to the oil & gas industry since 1944. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the number of active US oil drilling rigs being less than 585 on November 29, 2024, here are some key points and trends from the available data:\n\n## Current Rig Count\nAs of November 1, 2024, the total US rig count is 585, with 479 of these being oil rigs[2][3][5].\n\n## Recent Trends\n- The total US rig count has been relatively stable over the past few weeks, with minimal changes. For example, the count was unchanged from the previous week as of November 1, 2024[5].\n- The oil rig count specifically has also shown stability, with a slight decrease from 480 to 479 over the last week[3].\n\n## Historical Context\n- The US oil rig count has fluctuated but generally remained within a narrow range over the past year. It has been trending downward slightly, with a decrease from 504 oil rigs a year ago to the current 479[3].\n\n## Regional Variations\n- Different regions have shown varying levels of activity. For instance, the Permian Basin, one of the most active basins, saw a slight decrease in rig count from 304 to 303 over the last month[1][5].\n\n## Economic and Market Factors\n- Oil prices have been volatile but have not shown a significant downward trend that would immediately suggest a drastic reduction in rig counts. Prices have fluctuated between $68 and $77 per barrel over the past month[1].\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Stability in Recent Counts**: The rig count has been relatively stable, which suggests that there is no immediate indication of a significant drop.\n- **Historical Trends**: The slight downward trend over the past year does not necessarily predict a sharp decline in the near future.\n- **Economic Factors**: Current oil prices and other economic indicators do not strongly suggest an imminent reduction in rig counts.\n\nHowever, predicting the exact number of rigs on a specific date (November 29, 2024) involves uncertainties such as changes in oil prices, geopolitical events, and technological or operational adjustments that could influence drilling activities.\n\nTherefore, while the current trends do not strongly indicate a drop below 585 oil rigs, it is not possible to definitively answer the question with a yes or no based on the available data. The outcome depends on various factors that could change between now and November 29, 2024.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the total US rig count on November 8, 2024, less than 585?\nANSWER: No, the total US rig count on November 8, 2024, is not less than 585. According to the sources, the total US rig count remained unchanged at 585 rigs as of November 8, 2024[3][5][4].\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US rig count decreased below 585 at any point in the past six months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the US rig count has decreased below 585 in the past six months.\n\n- The sources consistently report that the US rig count has been at 585 for the recent weeks[3][4][5].\n- Historical data for the past six months shows fluctuations, but there is no mention of the rig count dropping below 585 during this period[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major US oil companies announced reductions in their drilling operations in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about major US oil companies announcing reductions in their drilling operations in November 2024. The sources discuss general trends, forecasts, and conditions in the oil and gas industry up to the end of 2023 and early 2024, but they do not provide details about specific announcements made in November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any known upcoming events before November 29, 2024, that are likely to cause a reduction in US drilling activity?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no specific upcoming events mentioned that are likely to cause a reduction in US drilling activity before November 29, 2024. Here are some key points:\n\n- The sources discuss current and forecasted trends in drilling activity, such as the impact of low natural gas prices and reduced drilling activities due to those prices, but they do not mention any specific upcoming events that would reduce drilling activity before November 29, 2024[2][3].\n- There is mention of ongoing factors like reduced takeaway capacity and the impact of new gas pipelines, but these are long-term trends rather than specific upcoming events[3].\n\nTherefore, based on the available information:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are oil prices currently trending downward significantly in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the key points relevant to the question:\n\n- Following the news of Donald Trump's election win on November 6, 2024, oil futures were slightly lower and trading in a tight range. NYMEX front-month crude was down 97 cents, and ICE front-month Brent was down 95 cents[1].\n\n- The overall trend for oil prices in 2024 has been influenced by various factors, including global demand concerns, increased production, and geopolitical tensions. However, the specific downward trend in November is attributed to immediate reactions to the election and other ongoing market dynamics[1][3][5].\n\n- There is no indication of a significant and sustained downward trend specifically in November 2024, but rather a continuation of the existing market conditions and short-term reactions. For example, oil prices had already been under pressure due to factors like increased production and weaker global demand[2][3][4].\n\nGiven this information, while there are downward pressures on oil prices, it does not indicate a significant and unique downward trend specifically in November 2024 that is distinct from the broader market conditions.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent decrease in demand for oil that could impact drilling activities?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThere has been a recent decrease in demand for oil, which could potentially impact drilling activities. Here are the key points:\n\n- Global oil demand growth is slowing sharply, with 2024 and 2025 seeing significantly lower growth rates compared to the post-pandemic period. The growth is expected to be around 900 kb/d in 2024 and 1 mb/d in 2025, down from 2 mb/d in 2023[1][2][3].\n\n- China, a major driver of global oil demand, has seen its oil consumption decline year-over-year for several consecutive months, contributing to the overall slowdown in global demand[1][2][3].\n\n- The EIA has reduced its forecast for global oil demand growth in 2025, primarily due to downward revisions in demand in OECD countries and continued declines in China's crude oil imports and refinery runs[3].\n\n- These reductions in demand have led to lower crude oil prices, which can influence drilling activities as lower prices may reduce the economic viability of some drilling projects[3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any significant weather event expected before November 29, 2024, that could disrupt drilling activities?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there are indications of potential significant weather events that could disrupt activities, including drilling, before November 29, 2024.\n\n1. **Severe Weather Outlook**: The Storm Prediction Center's Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook suggests that there is a modest severe potential during parts of the extended period, including the possibility of severe thunderstorms in various regions[3].\n\n2. **Current Severe Weather Threat**: As of November 4, 2024, there was a significant severe weather threat expected, particularly in the southern Plains into the Midwest, with risks of tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail. Although this specific event is past the current date, it indicates the ongoing potential for severe weather in the region[2].\n\n3. **Future Weather Patterns**: The forecast discussion mentions the possibility of an amplified upper trough progressing into the West early next week and reaching the central states mid-week, which could lead to severe weather events[3].\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a potential for significant weather events that could disrupt drilling activities before November 29, 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the global economic outlook suggesting a decrease in oil demand in the immediate future?\nANSWER: The global economic outlook does not suggest a decrease in oil demand in the immediate future, but rather a slowdown in the growth of oil demand.\n\n- The IEA reports that global oil demand growth is decelerating, with slower quarterly increases, but it still expects demand to grow, albeit at a slower rate. For example, global oil demand gains are forecasted to average just under 1 million barrels per day in 2024 and 2025[2][5].\n- Enverus Intelligence Research predicts that global oil demand will not peak or decline before the end of this decade, and instead will continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate[3].\n- The World Bank also notes a slowdown in oil demand growth, particularly due to factors like weak industrial production and the adoption of electric vehicles, but still projects an increase in demand, albeit a smaller one than in previous years[4].\n\nTherefore, the outlook indicates a slowing down of the growth rate rather than an immediate decrease in oil demand.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as the question asks for a decrease, but the sources indicate a slowdown in growth rather than a decrease).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the total US rig count decreased by more than 2 rigs over the past two weeks?\nANSWER: To determine if the total US rig count has decreased by more than 2 rigs over the past two weeks, we need to examine the recent changes in the rig count from the provided sources.\n\n1. **October 11 Rig Count**:\n   - According to the Baker Hughes data published on October 11, the total US rig count was 586 rigs. The US added one rig week on week[2].\n\n2. **October 4 Rig Count**:\n   - The week prior to that, on October 4, the total US rig count was 585 rigs, which means it dropped by 1 rig from the week before[4].\n\n3. **September 27 Rig Count**:\n   - On September 27, the US rig count was 586 rigs, indicating no change from the week ending October 4, but it did drop by 1 rig from the week ending September 27 to October 4[4].\n\nGiven this information:\n- From the week ending September 27 to October 4, the US rig count dropped by 1 rig.\n- From the week ending October 4 to October 11, the US rig count increased by 1 rig.\n\nTherefore, over the past two weeks, the total US rig count has not decreased by more than 2 rigs; in fact, it remained essentially stable with a net change of 0 rigs.\n\n**Answer: NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US government recently implemented or announced any policies that could negatively impact oil drilling before November 29, 2024?\nANSWER: Before November 29, 2024, the US government under the Biden administration had implemented or announced several policies that could potentially negatively impact oil drilling, although these measures have been somewhat mixed in their impact.\n\n1. **Increased Royalty Rates**: The Biden administration increased the federal royalty rate for new competitive oil and gas leases to 18.75%, up from the previous minimum of 12.5%. This increase, along with more robust environmental assessments, was part of the June 2022 lease sales[3][4].\n\n2. **Reduced Acreage for Drilling**: The Biden administration reduced the acreage available for drilling, eliminating 80% of the federal acreage originally nominated for competitive leasing. This reduction was part of the June 2022 leasing decisions[3][4].\n\n3. **Environmental Assessments**: The administration included more detailed greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impact analyses in the environmental assessments accompanying the lease sale notices, which could make the drilling process more stringent[3].\n\n4. **Pause on New Leases**: Although this was later overturned by a federal judge, the Biden administration initially paused the sale of new federal oil leases in January 2021, pending a comprehensive review of the federal oil and gas program[4].\n\nHowever, it is also important to note that despite these measures, the Biden administration has continued to approve drilling permits and conduct lease sales, which has been criticized by environmental groups[3][4]. Therefore, while there have been some policies aimed at reducing the impact of oil drilling, the overall effect has been limited by various factors, including legal challenges and ongoing industry activities.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: 18 days (from November 11, 2024, to November 29, 2024).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed**: If nothing changed, the total US rig count would remain at 585 rigs on November 29, 2024.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: With approximately 4-5 days left, the likelihood of the rig count dropping below 585 is low. I would forecast a low probability for the count to be less than 585.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left**: With about 72 days until November 29, 2024, there would be more opportunity for factors to influence the rig count. I would forecast a higher probability of the count dropping below 585.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale**:\n\n- **Current Rig Count**: As of November 1, 2024, the total US rig count is 585 rigs, unchanged from the previous week.\n\n- **Recent Trends**:\n  - The rig count has been relatively stable over the past few weeks with minimal changes.\n  - There has been a slight downward trend over the past year, decreasing from 504 oil rigs to 479.\n\n- **Economic and Market Factors**:\n  - **Oil Prices**: Oil prices have fluctuated between $68 and $77 per barrel over the past month, not indicating a significant downward trend that would lead to a drastic reduction in rig counts.\n  - **Global Demand**:\n    - Global oil demand growth is slowing but still expected to increase modestly.\n    - China's reduced oil consumption contributes to the slowdown but does not suggest an immediate decrease in US drilling activities.\n\n- **Potential Disruptions**:\n  - **Weather Events**: There is potential for significant weather events before November 29, 2024, which could temporarily disrupt drilling activities and reduce the rig count.\n  - **Policy Changes**: Recent US government policies have increased regulatory requirements and costs for drilling. However, no new policies specifically targeting a reduction in drilling before November 29, 2024, have been announced.\n\n- **Recent Activity**:\n  - The rig count has not decreased by more than 2 rigs over the past two weeks, indicating stability.\n  - No major US oil companies have announced reductions in their drilling operations in November 2024.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nGiven the stability of the rig count and the short time frame until November 29, 2024, significant changes in the total US rig count are unlikely. While there are factors such as potential weather disruptions and slight decreases in global demand that could impact the rig count, these are not expected to cause the count to drop below 585 within the next 18 days. Historical data suggests minimal fluctuations in such a short period.\n\n**Probability**: **20%**",
