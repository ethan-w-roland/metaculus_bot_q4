    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS exceed 2.4M for October 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which can be access through [this link](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view), shows greater than 2,400,000 background check initiated in October 2024. If the number is less than or equal to 2,400,000, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNumbers are expected to be reported in the month subsequent, so for example October numbers are expected to be reported in November. In case of reporting delays, resolution will wait, until the question will be annulled in early January 2025 if there are no numbers reported by then for the time in question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn the long term (since the turn of the 21st Century), firearms sales in the US have risen, surging in 2020, with numbers trending downward since. Starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers have again begun trending upward.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) will exceed 2.4 million for October 2024, here are some relevant points and context:\n\n## Historical Trends\n- The NICS background checks have shown significant variability over the years. For example, in 2020, a record year, over 21 million background checks were completed, with the highest single month being March 2020 with 2.3 million checks.\n- More recently, the monthly checks have remained above one million for over five years, but the numbers have not reached the peak levels seen in 2020.\n\n## Seasonal Patterns\n- Background checks tend to increase during certain periods, such as the final months of the year coinciding with hunting seasons and holiday sales. For instance, the week leading up to and including \"Black Friday\" typically sees a significant number of background checks.\n\n## Recent Data\n- In July 2024, the NSSF-adjusted NICS figure was 1,064,790, which was a 4.0 percent increase year-over-year but still below the levels seen in previous peak years like 2020 and 2016.\n- For the \"Black Friday\" week in 2023, the total background checks were 680,671, with 214,913 checks on \"Black Friday\" alone, indicating strong but not record-breaking activity.\n\n## Base Rates\n- The average monthly background checks over the past five years have been over one million, but exceeding 2.4 million in a single month would be unusually high and would need to surpass recent trends significantly.\n\nGiven these points, while it is possible for the number of background checks to increase due to seasonal factors or other influences, exceeding 2.4 million in October 2024 would be an outlier compared to recent monthly averages. However, without specific data for October 2024 or more detailed forecasts, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the number will exceed 2.4 million.\n\n### Superforecaster Relevant Details\n- **Base Rates**: Recent monthly averages are above one million but below 2.4 million.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The answer will be clear once the October 2024 data is released.\n- **Current State of the World**: No significant events or changes in laws have been reported that would drastically alter the current trend.\n- **Reference Classes**: Historical data shows that exceeding 2.4 million in a single month is rare and typically associated with exceptional circumstances like those in 2020.\n\nThe question cannot be clearly answered as yes or no without the specific data for October 2024.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did economic conditions in October 2024, such as a recession or inflation, affect consumer spending on firearms?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically address consumer spending on firearms in October 2024 or how economic conditions such as recession or inflation might have affected it. They discuss general economic trends, consumer confidence, labor market conditions, and inflation, but there is no mention of firearms or related consumer spending.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the number of FBI firearms background checks exceed 2.4 million in October 2023?\nANSWER: No, the number of FBI firearms background checks did not exceed 2.4 million in October 2023. According to the source, the unadjusted FBI NICS figure for October 2023 was 2,194,313, which is below 2.4 million.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there any nationwide firearms sales promotions or marketing campaigns in October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of nationwide firearms sales promotions or marketing campaigns that were exclusively conducted in October 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss general trends in gun sales, the impact of the 2024 election, and various industry activities, but they do not specify any nationwide promotions or campaigns for October 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is October historically a month with high numbers of FBI firearms background checks exceeding 2.4 million?\nANSWER: Based on the data provided by the FBI on NICS firearm background checks, October has not consistently exceeded 2.4 million checks historically.\n\n- The PDF from the FBI provides monthly data on NICS firearm background checks from 1998 to 2024. While some months in various years have seen high numbers, October specifically has not consistently reached or exceeded 2.4 million checks.\n- For example, in 2024, October saw about 1.3 million sales-related background checks, which is below the 2.4 million threshold.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent announcement or implementation of gun control legislation affecting firearms purchases in October 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThere have been recent announcements and implementations of gun control legislation affecting firearms purchases in October 2024:\n\n1. **Massachusetts**: Governor Maura Healey forced gun control law H. 4885 into effect on October 2, 2024, which includes various stringent measures on gun ownership and purchases.\n\n2. **New York**: Governor Kathy Hochul signed several gun safety bills into law on October 9, 2024, which include requirements for firearms dealers to post safety warnings, the use of unique tracking codes for gun and ammunition purchases, and enhancements to extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did any month in 2024 prior to October see FBI firearms background checks exceeding 2.4 million?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the relevant figures for the months in 2024 prior to October:\n\n- **June 2024**: The unadjusted FBI NICS figure was 1,958,447.\n- **July 2024**: The unadjusted FBI NICS figure was not explicitly mentioned in the sources provided, but it is known that the adjusted figure was over 1 million, and typically the unadjusted figures are higher than the adjusted ones.\n- **August 2024**: The unadjusted FBI NICS figure was 2,163,540.\n\nNone of these months exceeded 2.4 million unadjusted FBI NICS background checks. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been an upward trend in the number of FBI firearms background checks in the months leading up to October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there has not been a consistent upward trend in the number of FBI firearms background checks in the months leading up to October 2024.\n\n- The source from The Reload indicates that while there was a slight upward trend in the previous several months, October 2024 saw a 5% decline in FBI background checks compared to the same time last year. It also mentions declines in May, March, and April of the same year.\n- The NSSF report highlights that despite some monthly variations, the overall trend has included declines in certain months. For example, May saw a 7.2% year-over-year decline, and there were similar declines in March and April.\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that there was not a consistent upward trend leading up to October 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did any major incidents, such as mass shootings or civil unrest, occur in late 2024 that could influence firearms sales?\nANSWER: Yes, there were major incidents in late 2024 that could potentially influence firearms sales.\n\n1. **Mass Shooting at Apalachee High School**: On September 4, 2024, a mass shooting occurred at Apalachee High School in Winder, Georgia, resulting in the deaths of four individuals and injuries to around 30 others. This incident is a significant example of a mass shooting in late 2024.\n\n2. **Multiple Mass Shootings**: According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been more than 385 mass shootings across the US in 2024, with several incidents occurring in the latter part of the year. These include various shootings in different states such as Texas, Alabama, North Carolina, and others.\n\nSuch incidents often spark debates and discussions about gun control and firearms policies, which can influence public opinion and potentially impact firearms sales.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there significant events or legislative actions in October 2024 that could have spurred increased firearms purchases?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several significant events and conflicts mentioned that could potentially influence public behavior, including increased firearms purchases. Here are some key points:\n\n## International Conflicts and Tensions\n- The sources mention several ongoing and escalating conflicts, such as the Israelâ€“Hamas war, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and Iranian strikes against Israel. These events could create a climate of fear and uncertainty, potentially leading to increased demand for firearms.\n\n## Domestic Violence and Crime\n- Incidents like the Jaffa shooting and other mass shootings could also contribute to a sense of insecurity, prompting some individuals to purchase firearms for self-defense.\n\n## General Global Tensions\n- The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and other global conflicts could add to a general sense of instability, which might encourage some people to buy firearms.\n\nWhile these events do not directly mention legislative actions that would restrict or encourage firearms purchases, the overall climate of conflict and insecurity they describe could indeed spur increased demand for firearms.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there supply chain improvements or issues in 2024 that could impact the availability of firearms leading up to October?\nANSWER: There were ongoing supply chain issues in 2024 that could impact the availability of firearms and ammunition, rather than significant improvements. Here are some key points:\n\n## Supply Chain Challenges\n- The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) continues to face supply chain disruptions, including long lead times for deliveries and shortages of critical components such as rocket motors, electronics, and raw materials like nitrocellulose, which is essential for gunpowder and munitions production.\n\n## Specific Issues\n- The Navy's efforts to increase its weapons inventory have been hampered by supplier bottlenecks, particularly for components like rocket motors and electronics, which are crucial for producing missiles and other munitions.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic and other global events, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, have exacerbated supply chain disruptions, including shortages of materials like propellants for ammunition and metals like titanium and nickel.\n\n## Legislative and Administrative Efforts\n- While there are legislative efforts, such as the Ammunition Supply Chain Act, aimed at bolstering domestic production of critical components like nitrocellulose, these initiatives are still in the process of being implemented and may not have immediate effects on the current supply chain issues.\n\n## Ongoing Challenges\n- The DoD has identified long-standing supply chain challenges, including long lead times and difficulties in obtaining materials, which continue to affect various weapons programs.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that supply chain issues persisted in 2024 and could impact the availability of firearms and ammunition.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nSince today is November 5, 2024, and the FBI typically releases NICS firearms background check data within the first week of the following month, the data for October 2024 should be released within the next few days. Therefore, the time left until the outcome is known is approximately **1 week**.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends and historical patterns continue without significant change, the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS for October 2024 would likely be **below 2.4 million**, and the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only a few days remaining until the data release, and no indications of extraordinary events that could drastically increase firearms purchases, I would maintain my forecast that the number will remain below 2.4 million, with slightly increased confidence due to the shorter time frame.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately four weeks left until the outcome is known, there might be more uncertainty due to the potential for late reports or adjustments. However, since the data pertains to October 2024 and sales for that month have already concluded, my forecast would remain the same.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nTo estimate the probability, I considered the following factors:\n\n1. **Historical Data and Base Rates:**\n   - **Past October Figures:** Historically, October has not been a month where background checks exceed 2.4 million. For example, in October 2023, there were 2,194,313 checks, below the threshold.\n   - **Peak Months:** Typically, November and December see higher numbers due to hunting seasons and holiday sales (e.g., \"Black Friday\" promotions).\n\n2. **Recent Trends:**\n   - **2024 Monthly Data:** In months leading up to October 2024, such as August, the unadjusted NICS figures were around 2.16 million, still below 2.4 million.\n   - **Year-Over-Year Changes:** While there have been slight increases in some months, there hasn't been a significant upward trend indicating a surge above 2.4 million.\n\n3. **External Factors:**\n   - **Legislation Impact:** Recent gun control laws in states like Massachusetts and New York could have spurred increased purchases in those states. However, these states represent a portion of national sales, and the impact may not be enough to push the national total over 2.4 million.\n   - **Significant Events:** Incidents such as mass shootings and international conflicts can influence firearm sales, but there is no clear evidence that events in late 2024 led to a nationwide surge in October.\n   - **Supply Chain Issues:** Ongoing supply chain challenges could limit the availability of firearms and ammunition, potentially constraining sales.\n\n4. **Economic Conditions:**\n   - **Consumer Spending:** There is no specific information indicating that economic conditions in October 2024 significantly boosted consumer spending on firearms.\n   - **Inflation/Recession Effects:** General economic uncertainty can affect discretionary spending, but without clear data, it's difficult to assess the impact on firearms purchases.\n\n5. **Seasonal Patterns:**\n   - **Timing of Promotions:** Major sales events that boost firearm purchases, such as those around \"Black Friday,\" occur in November.\n\n6. **Current State of the World:**\n   - **No Major Unforeseen Events:** As of early November 2024, there are no reports of extraordinary events in October that would have caused a dramatic spike in firearm background checks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the historical data, recent trends, and lack of significant indicators pointing toward an unusual increase in October 2024, it is **unlikely** that the number of FBI firearms background checks exceeded 2.4 million for that month.\n\n---\n\n**Probability:** **10%**",
