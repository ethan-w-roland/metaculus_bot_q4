    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill there be a large-scale armed conflict in Russia before January 1, 2025?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-11\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, at any point before January 1, 2025, there is a large-scale armed conflict in Russia, according to credible media reports.  For this question, a “a large-scale armed conflict” is a conflict which meets these criteria:\n\n* results in at least 1,000 deaths in Russia\n* has at least 100 participants directly involved in the killings,\n* with the majority of the participants on both sides being Russian citizens.\n\nSome examples of such events from the Russian history include the Russian Revolution, the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War), the [First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Chechen_War) and [Second Chechen Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chechen_War). We ignore such events if they happen mostly in Crimea or any other territory occupied by Russia since 2014.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIn case there are several smaller deadly events (e.g. a series of terrorist attacks), and it's unclear if they should be counted together as one conflict, then we use the following additional criterion:\n\nthere should be a page on Wikipedia about the conflict.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn the history of Russia, failed military campaigns sometimes triggered large-scale conflicts within Russia. For example, the humiliating defeats of the Russo-Japanese War culminated in the [1905 Russian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1905_Russian_Revolution).\n\nThe possible defeat of Russia in the Russo-Ukrainian War, combined with the severe economic crisis, may trigger a comparable conflict. For example, a violent coup d'état, a civil war, a revolution, an armed secession movement.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of a large-scale armed conflict within Russia itself before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Internal Stability and Putin's Rule\nThe current scenario suggests that Vladimir Putin's continued rule is the most likely outcome in the near future, given the lack of significant domestic pushback despite the heavy casualties and economic struggles Russia is facing due to the war in Ukraine[1].\n\n## Domestic Unrest\nWhile there are risks of political upheaval due to domestic unrest, these risks are not currently deemed high. The Russian government has taken measures to maintain control, such as increasing the maximum draft age to mobilize more recruits, which indicates a proactive approach to managing internal stability[3].\n\n## External Conflict\nThe focus of Russia's military efforts remains on the conflict in Ukraine rather than internal conflicts. Russia's strategic goals include exhausting Ukraine's ability to continue fighting and maintaining territorial acquisitions, but there is no indication of a large-scale armed conflict brewing within Russia itself[2].\n\n## Economic and Military Strains\nRussia's economy is under strain, and the military is engaged in a costly and attritional conflict in Ukraine. However, there is no clear evidence to suggest that these strains will lead to a large-scale internal armed conflict in the immediate future[1][2].\n\n## Nuclear and Geopolitical Risks\nThe threat of nuclear escalation and geopolitical tensions are more relevant to the conflict with Ukraine and potential interactions with NATO, rather than indicating an internal conflict within Russia[2][3].\n\nGiven these points, there is no strong evidence to suggest that a large-scale armed conflict will occur within Russia before January 1, 2025. The primary focus of Russia's military and political efforts remains on the external conflict with Ukraine and managing the geopolitical landscape, rather than on internal conflicts. However, the situation is highly dynamic, and unforeseen events could alter this assessment.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any armed uprisings or mutinies against the Russian government or military leadership since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war?\nANSWER: YES, there have been armed uprisings or mutinies against the Russian government or military leadership since the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war.\n\nOne notable example is the Wagner Group rebellion that occurred on June 23, 2023. The Wagner Group, a Russian private military company, staged an uprising against the Russian government and military leadership. Led by Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the group occupied Rostov-on-Don and seized Russia’s southern military headquarters, and their convoys advanced towards Moscow before being halted through negotiations involving Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko[1][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there increased activity of armed groups within Russia not under government control?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence to suggest that there have been activities involving armed groups or formations within Russia, but these are not necessarily indicative of increased activity of armed groups not under government control in the general sense.\n\n- The Russian Military Doctrine mentions the creation, equipping, and training of \"illegal armed formations\" as a threat to Russia's military security, but this does not provide recent or specific evidence of increased activity[4].\n- The sources primarily focus on external conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine, and the activities of private military companies (PMCs) like the Wagner Group, which are often closely tied to the Russian government and its interests[2][5].\n\nThere is no clear evidence in the provided sources to indicate an increase in the activity of armed groups within Russia that are not under government control. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there reports of significant numbers of Russian military personnel defying orders or deserting?\nANSWER: There are indications of discontent and defiance within the Russian military, although the extent of desertions or large-scale defiance is not fully quantified in the sources provided.\n\n- Reports from the Atlantic Council mention growing demoralization among Russian troops and commanders, with video addresses on social media complaining of \"suicidal orders and catastrophic losses\"[2].\n- High-ranking officers, such as General Sergei Surovikin, have been detained or dismissed, suggesting internal tensions and potential disaffection within the military leadership[2].\n- General Ivan Popov's public accusations against Russia’s military leadership further highlight the dissatisfaction among some military personnel[2].\n\nWhile these reports indicate significant discontent, they do not provide a clear picture of widespread desertions or large-scale defiance of orders. However, they do suggest a notable level of dissatisfaction and potential for further challenges to Putin's authority within the military.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Russian government intensified efforts to suppress dissent, such as mass arrests or media censorship?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe sources provided clearly indicate that the Russian government has significantly intensified its efforts to suppress dissent through various measures, including:\n\n- Mass arrests and imprisonment of dissenters, journalists, and activists under new and repressive laws[1][2][5].\n- The use of \"foreign agents\" laws to smear and silence independent critics of the government[1][4].\n- The implementation of \"war censorship\" laws that criminalize criticism of the war in Ukraine, leading to lengthy prison sentences for anti-war dissent[2][5].\n- Stricter oversight over education, media, and public gatherings, including a stringent licensing system for protests and harsh penalties for unauthorized assemblies[1][5].\n- The abuse of anti-terrorism and anti-extremism laws to stifle dissent and control public discourse[3].\n- Targeting of various groups, including LGBTQ+ activists, religious figures, and indigenous groups, with harsh censorship, intimidation, and prosecution[2][4].\n\nThese measures have created a climate of fear and repression, severely restricting civil and political freedoms in Russia.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any high-ranking Russian officials or influential figures publicly opposed the current government?\nANSWER: Yes, several high-ranking Russian officials and influential figures have publicly opposed the current government.\n\n- Aleksei Navalny, an imprisoned opposition politician, has been a vocal critic of President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin, leading massive anti-Kremlin protests and crusading against official corruption[1][4][5].\n- Boris Nemtsov, a former regional governor and deputy prime minister, was a vocal opponent of Putin and criticized Russia’s aggression against Ukraine before his death in 2015[1].\n- Sergei Yushenkov, a veteran politician and leader of the anti-Kremlin party Liberal Russia, investigated the involvement of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in apartment bombings and was critical of the government before his death in 2003[1].\n- Anna Politkovskaya, a prominent journalist, was a persistent critic of human rights abuses in Chechnya and the Kremlin-backed leadership there before her death in 2006[1].\n- Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner Group, launched a mutiny against the Russian government in June 2023, criticizing the Russian Ministry of Defence's handling of the Ukraine invasion[4].\n\nThese individuals, among others, have publicly opposed various aspects of the current Russian government and its policies.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there active separatist movements within Russia that could potentially lead to large-scale armed conflicts?\nANSWER: Yes, there are active separatist movements within Russia that have the potential to lead to large-scale armed conflicts.\n\nSeveral sources highlight various separatist movements across different regions of Russia:\n\n- In Bashkortostan, there have been significant protests and accusations of separatism, although the primary issue was not separatism itself but rather a local environmental activist's sentencing. However, the region does have separatist sentiments and advocacy groups[1][4].\n\n- Regions like Tatarstan, Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia have long-standing separatist movements. For example, Tatarstan declared its sovereignty and independence in the early 1990s, and there are ongoing movements advocating for greater autonomy or independence[4].\n\n- Other regions such as the Ural Federal District, Siberian Federal District, and the Northwestern Federal District also have various separatist movements focused on preserving local culture, language, and ecology, or seeking greater autonomy or independence[4].\n\n- The presence of militant organizations and advocacy groups in these regions indicates a level of organizational capacity and determination that could escalate into armed conflicts if not managed carefully[4][5].\n\nThese movements and the historical context of separatist conflicts in Russia suggest that there is a significant potential for large-scale armed conflicts if these tensions are not addressed.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Russian economy experienced severe downturns that might destabilize the country?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe Russian economy is facing significant challenges and severe downturns that could destabilize the country. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The economy is heavily impacted by Western sanctions, leading to a decline in oil and gas sales, which are crucial for Russia's revenue. This has resulted in a 24% drop in oil and gas sales to a three-year low in 2023[2][5].\n\n- The redirection of resources to the defense sector has compromised the productive core of the Russian economy, leading to inflation, labor shortages, and a strained labor market. This has created an unsustainable economic environment[1][4].\n\n- Russia is expected to face a severe recession within the year due to the loss of access to 'petrodollars' and the impact of sanctions on its trade and finances[2][5].\n\n- The country is experiencing high inflation, with an annualized rate of price increases standing at 10% from May to July, and interest rates have been raised to 18% and even 21% in an attempt to control inflation[1][4].\n\n- The economic situation is further complicated by a significant deficit, labor shortages, and a looming demographic crisis, all of which contribute to a precarious economic outlook[2][4].\n\nThese factors collectively indicate that the Russian economy is indeed experiencing severe downturns that could destabilize the country.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant domestic opposition movements to Vladimir Putin's government within Russia as of October 2023?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, there are indeed opposition movements to Vladimir Putin's government within Russia, although their effectiveness and visibility are significantly hampered by various factors.\n\n- The Russian opposition is divided between the \"systemic opposition\" (parliamentary opposition parties that are largely loyal to the government) and the \"non-systemic opposition\" (groups that actively oppose the government but are mostly unrepresented in government bodies)[5].\n- Non-systemic opposition groups, such as Yabloko, the People's Freedom Party, and various NGOs, continue to exist and engage in anti-government activities. However, they face severe repression, including laws and measures designed to prevent their electoral success[5].\n- Women-led initiatives, such as the Feminist Anti-War Resistance Initiative (FAS) and The Way Home, have been active in organizing protests against the war in Ukraine and advocating for women's rights, despite facing persecution and being declared \"undesirable organizations\"[1].\n- The opposition is also hindered by internal divisions and a lack of unity, which complicates their ability to present a cohesive front against Putin's regime[2][3].\n- Despite these challenges, there are ongoing efforts to unite the opposition, such as those proposed by Maxim Katz, although achieving unity remains a significant challenge[3].\n\nIn summary, while there are domestic opposition movements, their impact is limited by repression, internal divisions, and the repressive capacity of the state. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of increasing public dissatisfaction among the Russian population due to economic hardships?\nANSWER: While there are mixed signals regarding the overall sentiment of the Russian population, there are indications of increasing public dissatisfaction due to economic hardships in several areas:\n\n## Economic Optimism vs. Realities\nDespite record percentages of Russians believing their local economy and living standards are improving in 2023, there are underlying signs of strain. For example, the proportion of people satisfied with their current living standards fell from 57% to 49% in 2023, and a third (34%) struggled to afford food at times, up from 27% in 2022[3].\n\n## Impact of War and Sanctions\nThe war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions have had tangible effects on the Russian economy. The real estate market, demand for credit, and consumer sentiment have all shown noticeable declines. The population's real income has also declined, and there is a growing awareness among Russians that the war is affecting their well-being negatively[2].\n\n## Public Services and Funding Issues\nRussia's public services, including healthcare and education, are facing chronic issues due to insufficient funding and staff shortages, exacerbated by the prioritization of military spending. Low salaries in these sectors have led to staffing problems and work overload, indicating significant economic hardships for public sector employees[4].\n\n## Consumer Sentiment and Economic Expectations\nThe Consumer Sentiment Index of the Russian Central Bank shows that the population's assessment of their current economic situation and their economic expectations have deteriorated sharply. This suggests that while there may be optimism in some areas, there is a growing realization of the economic challenges faced by ordinary Russians[2].\n\nIn summary, while there is some optimism among Russians about their economy, there are clear signs of increasing public dissatisfaction due to various economic hardships.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a historical precedent for military defeats leading to large-scale internal conflicts in Russia?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a historical precedent for military defeats leading to large-scale internal conflicts in Russia.\n\nSeveral historical instances illustrate this pattern:\n\n1. **Russian Defeats in World War I**: The military failures and heavy losses suffered by Russia during World War I contributed significantly to the internal unrest and eventual overthrow of the Russian monarchy. The poor performance of the Russian army, combined with economic hardship and social discontent, led to the February Revolution of 1917, which toppled the Romanov dynasty, and ultimately to the October Revolution, which established the Soviet Union[4].\n\n2. **Russo-Japanese War and the 1905 Revolution**: The defeat in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) led to widespread discontent and contributed to the Russian Revolution of 1905. This revolution forced Tsar Nicholas II to grant concessions, including the establishment of a constitutional monarchy and the Duma (the Russian parliament)[4].\n\n3. **Chechen Wars**: The First Chechen War (1994-1996) was highly unpopular and led to significant internal criticism of the Russian government. The war's failure and the subsequent withdrawal of Russian forces were followed by a period of instability and further conflict in the region[4].\n\n4. **General Pattern**: Historically, significant military defeats have often been followed by periods of domestic liberalization, regime change, or outright collapse in Russia. For example, the defeat in the Crimean War (1853-1856) led to reforms under Alexander II, including the emancipation of serfs in 1861. Similarly, the defeat in World War I and the subsequent civil war led to the establishment of the Soviet Union[4].\n\nThese examples demonstrate that military defeats have indeed led to large-scale internal conflicts and significant changes in Russia.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nApproximately 50 days remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current conditions persist without significant changes, the outcome would likely be **No**, as there have been no reports of a large-scale armed conflict in Russia that meets the specified criteria.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith about 12 days remaining, the probability of such a conflict occurring would be very low, around **2%**.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nWith approximately 200 days remaining, the probability would increase to about **10%**, allowing more time for potential developments.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 11, 2024, there have been instances of internal dissent and unrest in Russia, such as the Wagner Group mutiny in June 2023. While these events indicate underlying tensions, they have not escalated to a large-scale armed conflict meeting the resolution criteria (1,000 deaths, 100 participants, majority Russian citizens on both sides).\n\nThe Russian government has intensified efforts to suppress dissent through mass arrests, media censorship, and stringent laws against opposition groups. Despite economic hardships and public dissatisfaction due to sanctions and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the government maintains a strong grip on power.\n\nHistorical precedents show that military defeats can lead to internal conflicts in Russia. However, such conflicts typically require more time to materialize and escalate. With only 50 days left until January 1, 2025, the window for a large-scale armed conflict to emerge is narrow.\n\nConsidering these factors:\n\n- **Short Time Frame:** The limited time reduces the likelihood of an armed conflict developing and reaching the specified criteria.\n- **Government Control:** The government's suppression mechanisms are currently effective in preventing large-scale uprisings.\n- **Economic Strain:** While significant, economic hardships alone may not trigger a conflict within the short period remaining.\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
