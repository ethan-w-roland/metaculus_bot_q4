    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, scheduled to open December 13, 2024, exceed $20,000,000?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the domestic box office for the opening weekend of The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim, according to the tracking page on [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt14824600/?ref_=bo_se_r_1) exceeds USD $20,000,000.00. If the number is less than or equal to that, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf BoxOfficeMojo fails to report the number before January 1, 2025, other credible sources may be considered. If the film is not released before January 1, 2025, the question will be **annulled**. This question resolves based on the figures reported when they are accessed by Metaculus Admins, and further revisions will not be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [BoxOfficeTheory](https://boxofficetheory.com/5-week-tracking-forecasts-kraven-the-hunter-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-and-a-big-moana-2-update/), a movie forecasting company, The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is expected to have an opening weekend of $20 million. Box Office Mojo generally [defines](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-mojo-by-imdbpro-faq/GCWTV4MQKGWRAUAP#domesticinternational) \"domestic\" as gross box-office revenue from North America (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico). According to the [Box Office by IMDbPro Glossary](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-by-imdbpro-glossary/GN8HA87MT4597FSW?ref_=mojo_ftr_glossary#boxofficetracking):\n>Box office tracking refers to theatrical box office earnings. Additional sources of revenue, such as home entertainment sales and rentals, television rights, product placement fees, etc. are not included.\n\n>Gross refers to gross earnings in U.S. dollars. On average, a movie's distributor receives a little more than half of the final gross (often referred to as the \"rentals\") with the remainder going to the exhibitor (i.e. movie theater). The money split varies from movie to movie, but, generally, the contract favors the distributor in early weeks and shifts to the exhibitor later on.\n\n>Weekend box office charts show gross receipts for a given weekend, which is Friday through Sunday unless otherwise noted. Studio estimates for the weekend are reported on Sunday mornings, generally between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Pacific Time and reflect estimated Friday and Saturday box office receipts plus a projection for Sunday.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of *The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim* will exceed $20,000,000, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Box Office Projections\n- According to the 5-week tracking forecasts, the domestic opening weekend for *The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim* is projected to be between $15,000,000 and $24,000,000, with a target forecast of $17,500,000[1].\n\n## Worldwide Box Office Range\n- While the worldwide box office range is estimated to be between $276M and $374M, this does not directly translate to the domestic opening weekend, but it indicates a level of expected interest in the film[2].\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n- The film is opening on the same weekend as *Kraven the Hunter*, which could impact its box office performance due to potential crossover demographic appeal and competition for audience attention[1].\n\nGiven these projections, it is highly likely that the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of *The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim* will exceed $20,000,000, as the low-end estimate is already at $15,000,000 and the target forecast is higher than this threshold.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer to whether the domestic opening weekend box office revenue will exceed $20,000,000 is **yes**.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim scheduled to be released on a weekend?\nANSWER: The release date for \"The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim\" is December 13, 2024.

Therefore, the answer to whether the marketing campaign is comparable in scale to other successful fantasy films is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major competing film releases scheduled for December 13, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several major film releases scheduled for December 13, 2024. Here are some of the notable ones:\n\n- **Kraven the Hunter**: An action/fantasy film directed by J.C. Chandor and starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Russell Crowe, and Ariana DeBose[1][5].\n- **The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim**: An animation/action film directed by Kenji Kamiyama and starring Brian Cox, Miranda Otto, and Shaun Dooley[1][2][5].\n- **September 5**: A historical/thriller film directed by Tim Fehlbaum and starring Peter Sarsgaard, John Magaro, and Ben Chaplin[1][2][5].\n- **Elton John: Never Too Late**: A documentary/biography film directed by R.J.

This is evident from the anticipation and performance of various movies released in December, as mentioned in the sources[1][4].\n\n2. **Specific Films and Genres**: December has seen the release of several successful fantasy and fantasy-related films in the past. For example, films like *Mary Poppins Returns* and *Into the Woods*, which are fantasy musicals, have performed well in December[4].\n\n3. **Recent Examples**: In December 2023, films like *Wonka*, *Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom*, and *Migration* were released, indicating that December can be a favorable time for fantasy and related genre films to perform well at the box office[1][4].\n\nHowever, these points do not conclusively establish a consistent seasonal trend specific to fantasy films in December. They suggest that December can be a strong month for the box office in general, but do not provide enough evidence to confirm a specific trend for fantasy films alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent changes in movie theater attendance trends in North America that could impact the film's opening weekend revenue?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent changes in movie theater attendance trends in North America that could impact a film's opening weekend revenue.\n\n1. **Impact of Labor Strikes**: The 2023 Hollywood writers and actors strikes have resulted in a thinner release schedule, affecting box office revenue and attendance in 2024. This reduction in blockbuster releases has led to lower revenue and attendance for some cinema operators[4].\n\n2. **Inflation and Consumer Behavior**: High inflation has caused consumers to be more cautious about spending, which has affected movie theater attendance. Despite cooling inflation, budget decisions are still influenced by these economic conditions[3].\n\n3. **Shift in Consumer Preferences**: There is a growing demand for premium movie experiences, such as premium large formats, comfortable seating, and upscale concessions. This shift indicates that moviegoers are looking for more than just the standard cinema experience, which could influence attendance and revenue[3].\n\n4. **Demographic Changes**: The movie market is experiencing an increase in attendance from specific demographics, such as the 18-24 age group and female audiences. However, overall per capita admissions are still trending lower than pre-pandemic levels[2][3].\n\n5. **Post-Pandemic Trends**: The pandemic has accelerated the decline in per capita theatrical admissions, and despite some positive trends, the industry is not expected to return to pre-pandemic attendance levels immediately. The early evidence suggests that the decline is more structural than just a reaction to the pandemic or recent film slates[1].\n\nThese factors collectively indicate significant changes in movie theater attendance trends that could impact a film's opening weekend revenue.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nApproximately **3 weeks** remain until the domestic opening weekend box office revenue for *The Lord of The Rings: The War of the Rohirrim* is known (resolution date: December 15, 2024).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions remain unchanged, the projection for the opening weekend is around **$17.5 million**, which is **below** the $20 million threshold. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about **3-4 days** left until the release, uncertainty increases due to last-minute factors such as final marketing pushes, reviews, and audience sentiment. In this shortened timeframe, I would forecast a **40%** probability that the opening weekend exceeds $20 million.\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith roughly **12 weeks** remaining, there would be ample time to observe trends in ticket sales, marketing effectiveness, and any emerging competitive releases. Assuming no significant negative changes, I would forecast a **60%** probability that the opening weekend exceeds $20 million.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe current projection of $17.5 million suggests a slight shortfall from the $20 million threshold. However, historical performance of the *Lord of the Rings* franchise shows strong opening weekends well above this amount, indicating a robust fan base and brand loyalty. Positive early reviews and successful marketing efforts could bolster ticket sales, while competition from *Kraven the Hunter* and evolving theater attendance trends introduce uncertainties. The balance between these factors leads to a moderate probability estimate.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**Probability: 50%**",
    "probability": 50
