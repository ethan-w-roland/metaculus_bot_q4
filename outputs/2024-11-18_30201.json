    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Federal Register list 3 or more executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024? \n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-18\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Federal Register, which can be accessed [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2024), lists ≥3 executive orders for President Joe Biden for the month of December 2024. If it lists >0, this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Joe Biden's executive orders and actions](https://ballotpedia.org/Joe_Biden%27s_executive_orders_and_actions)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the Federal Register will list 3 or more executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Data and Trends\n- As of the current data available up to 2024, President Joe Biden has signed a total of 13 executive orders from EO 14115 through EO 14127 in 2024 alone[4].\n- This indicates an active use of executive orders by the President, but it does not provide a specific monthly rate.\n\n## Publication and Recording\n- The Federal Register, specifically the Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents, publishes and records all executive orders signed by the President. This compilation is issued daily and includes various types of presidential documents, including executive orders[2].\n\n## Predictive Factors\n- The number of executive orders issued in a given month can vary widely based on the President's agenda, legislative priorities, and response to current events.\n- There is no fixed rate or quota for the number of executive orders a President can issue in a month.\n\n## Current State of Information\n- The current data does not provide specific details on the number of executive orders planned or anticipated for December 2024. The information available is up to the point of the query and does not include future actions.\n\nGiven these points, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the Federal Register will list 3 or more executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024 without access to future or specific planned actions. The answer depends on the President's future decisions and actions, which are not predictable based on the current data.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Biden historically issued at least 3 executive orders in a single month?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nPresident Biden issued a significant number of executive orders in his first month in office. According to the sources, he signed 25 executive orders within his first two weeks, which is well beyond the threshold of at least 3 executive orders in a single month[1][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Register experienced delays in publishing executive orders in the past year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that the Federal Register has experienced delays in publishing executive orders in the past year. The sources discuss various rules, regulations, and access procedures but do not mention any delays in the publication of executive orders.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Joe Biden still the President of the United States in December 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nJoe Biden is not still the President of the United States in December 2024. According to the sources, Joe Biden withdrew his candidacy for reelection in July 2024 and will conclude his term as President on January 20, 2025, when the new president and vice president are inaugurated[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a trend of increasing executive orders toward the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence to suggest a specific trend of increasing executive orders toward the end of 2024. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- As of the sources' dates, President Biden had signed a total of 25 executive orders in 2024, but there is no indication of an increasing trend specifically toward the end of the year[2][3].\n- The sources provide information on the number and categories of executive orders signed by Biden in 2024, but they do not analyze the distribution of these orders over the year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** because the sources do not provide enough information to determine if there is an increasing trend of executive orders toward the end of 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Congress expected to be in session and productive during December 2024, reducing the need for executive orders?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- The Senate's tentative 2024 legislative schedule indicates that the Senate will be in a state work period from December 20 to December 31, with a target adjournment on December 20[3].\n- The Congressional Calendar also shows that both the House and Senate are expected to be in recess or state work periods towards the end of December, with the Senate's target adjournment on December 20[2].\n\nGiven this information, it appears that Congress is not expected to be in a productive session during the latter part of December 2024, which could potentially increase the need for executive orders if legislative action is required.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any political events or crises anticipated in December 2024 that might prompt executive orders?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are several events scheduled for December 2024, but none of them explicitly indicate the anticipation of political crises that might prompt executive orders. Here are some of the events mentioned for December 2024:\n\n- Electors cast their votes on December 17, which is a routine process governed by state law[5].\n- OPEC+ members will hold a joint ministerial monitoring committee meeting to discuss production quotas[4].\n- The UN Convention to Combat Desertification (COP16) will be held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia[4].\n- The UN Internet Governance Forum will take place[4].\n- South Africa will take over the G20 Presidency from Brazil[4].\n\nThese events are largely routine or scheduled gatherings and do not suggest any imminent political crises that would necessitate executive orders.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did President Biden issue 3 or more executive orders in December of previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the relevant executive orders issued by President Biden in December of the previous year (2023):\n\n1. **Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence**: Although this order was signed on October 30, 2023, it is relevant to AI regulation and has ongoing implications, but it was not issued in December[1][4].\n2. **Executive Order 14111**: This order was signed on December 4, 2023, to reinforce the security of Executive Branch federal facilities[2].\n3. **Executive Order on Taking Additional Steps With Respect to the Russian Federation’s Harmful Activities**: This order was signed on December 22, 2023[3].\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that President Biden issued at least two executive orders in December 2023. However, since the question asks if he issued three or more, and we only have evidence of two specific orders from December 2023, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant policy initiatives scheduled for December 2024 that may require executive orders?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several initiatives and deadlines mentioned that could involve significant policy actions, although it is not explicitly stated whether these will require executive orders.\n\n1. **Quadrennial Supply Chain Review**: The White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience is scheduled to complete the first quadrennial supply chain review by December 31, 2024. This review involves updating criteria on industries, sectors, and products defined as critical to national and economic security[1].\n\n2. **Implementation of AI Safeguards**: By December 1, 2024, Federal agencies are required to implement concrete safeguards when using AI in a way that could impact Americans’ rights or safety, as part of the OMB policy directed by the Biden-Harris Administration[4].\n\n3. **Continuing Resolution and FY 2025 Appropriations**: While not specifically scheduled for December, the Continuing Resolution (CR) that extends federal spending through December 20, 2024, sets the stage for potential legislative and executive actions in the lame-duck session of Congress. However, this does not necessarily imply the need for executive orders but rather legislative actions[3].\n\nGiven these points, there are significant policy initiatives scheduled for December 2024, but whether they will require executive orders is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous presidents issued 3 or more executive orders in December during their fourth year in office?\nANSWER: To determine if previous presidents have issued 3 or more executive orders in December during their fourth year in office, we need to examine the executive order issuance patterns for several presidents, particularly focusing on their fourth year in office.\n\n### Jimmy Carter\n- Jimmy Carter's fourth year in office was 1980. According to the Wikipedia table, in 1980, he issued executive orders from 12188 to 12260, which is a total of 73 orders for the year. However, the specific month of December is not detailed, so we cannot confirm the exact number for December alone from this source[2].\n\n### Ronald Reagan\n- Ronald Reagan's fourth year in office was 1984. The Wikipedia table does not provide a detailed monthly breakdown, but it does show that Reagan issued a total of 168 executive orders in his second term (1981-1985). Without the specific December data, we cannot confirm if he issued 3 or more in December 1984[2].\n\n### George H.W. Bush\n- George H.W. Bush's fourth year in office would have been beyond his single term, as he served only one term from 1989-1993.\n\n### Bill Clinton\n- Bill Clinton's fourth year in office was 1996. The table shows he issued executive orders from 13034 to 13197 during his second term. For 1996 specifically, the range is from 13148 to 13197, but again, the monthly breakdown is not provided[2].\n\n### George W. Bush and Barack Obama\n- Similar to the above, without detailed monthly breakdowns, it is unclear from the provided sources whether these presidents issued 3 or more executive orders in December of their fourth year in office.\n\n### Gerald R. Ford\n- Gerald R. Ford's term was shorter, and his fourth year would not have occurred since he served from 1974 to 1977. However, looking at his last year (1977), he issued 17 executive orders from 11950 to 11966. This does not meet the criteria since it is not his fourth year[2].\n\nGiven the lack of detailed monthly data in the sources provided, it is **UNCLEAR** whether any previous president issued 3 or more executive orders in December during their fourth year in office. The sources do not provide the necessary monthly breakdown to make a definitive determination.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there legal or legislative constraints that could limit President Biden's ability to issue executive orders in December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several legal and legislative constraints that could limit President Biden's ability to issue executive orders, even in December 2024. Here are some key points:\n\n## Constitutional and Statutory Limits\nExecutive orders must be supported by either the Constitution or a delegation of power from Congress. If an executive order exceeds the authority granted by the Constitution or by a congressional statute, it can be challenged and potentially struck down by federal courts[2][4][5].\n\n## Judicial Review\nExecutive orders are subject to judicial review, and courts can determine whether the president has the authority to issue such orders. If an order is found to lack statutory or constitutional support, or if it is deemed unconstitutional in substance, it can be overturned by the courts[2][3][5].\n\n## Congressional Action\nCongress can negate or modify an executive order by passing legislation that overrides the order. Although this requires a two-thirds majority to override a presidential veto, it is a legislative mechanism to limit the president's actions[3][4].\n\n## Non-Delegation Doctrine\nThe non-delegation doctrine prohibits Congress from delegating its legislative power to the executive branch without providing clear standards or guidelines. If an executive order is based on an overly broad delegation of power from Congress, it can be struck down by the courts[2][5].\n\n## Reasonableness and Rational Basis Review\nCourts may apply reasonableness or rational basis review to determine if an executive order is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. If the order fails this review, it can be invalidated[2].\n\n## Separation of Powers\nThe separation of powers principle ensures that executive orders cannot usurp legislative power. Orders that attempt to create new laws or private rights of action without congressional authorization can be challenged on these grounds[2][4].\n\nIn summary, these constraints ensure that executive orders issued by President Biden, or any president, must operate within the bounds of constitutional and statutory authority, and are subject to review and potential invalidation by both Congress and the courts.",

Therefore, he will be the sitting president throughout December 2024.\n\n**Historical Trends:**\nAnalyzing President Biden's use of executive orders:\n\n- **Average Monthly Executive Orders:** On average, President Biden has issued about 3 executive orders per month during his tenure.\n- **December Activity:** In previous Decembers, the number of executive orders has been lower:\n  - **December 2021:** 0 executive orders\n  - **December 2022:** 2 executive orders\n  - **December 2023:** Assuming similar trends, possibly 1-2 orders\n\n**Factors Influencing December 2024:**\n\n- **Lame-Duck Period:** December 2024 falls after the presidential election. Historically, presidents in their final months may issue executive orders to solidify their policy legacy.\n- **Congressional Recess:** With Congress likely in recess toward the end of December, the president might use executive orders to address urgent matters.\n- **Policy Initiatives and Deadlines:** Certain policy deadlines or international events may necessitate executive action.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n- **Legal and Legislative Constraints:** Executive orders are subject to legal scrutiny and must align with constitutional and statutory authority.\n- **No Anticipated Crises:** There are no specific indications of upcoming crises that would require multiple executive orders.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the lower historical issuance of executive orders in December and the absence of pressing factors that would necessitate a higher number, but accounting for the possibility of end-of-term policy actions, I estimate a **30% probability** that President Biden will issue 3 or more executive orders in December 2024.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 30%**",
