    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill George Soros be ranked in the top 400 richest people in the world on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-11\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to the [Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#482980403d78) George Soros is ranked 400th or better on December 31, 2024. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf the resolution source is unavailable on December 31, 2024, resolution will wait until it is available (at which point it resolves based on the data shown), until January 3, 2024, at which point this question will be **annulled**. For more details on various edge cases regarding availability of or changes to the resolution source, please see Metaculus's ambiguity and annulment policies [here](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#ambiguous-annulled).  \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of October 8, 2024, George Soros was ranked 424th on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether George Soros will be ranked in the top 400 richest people in the world on December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Current Net Worth\nAs of October 2023, George Soros had a net worth of $6.7 billion[4].\n\n## Ranking Context\nThe top 400 richest people in the world include individuals with net worths significantly lower than the top 10 or even top 100. For example, the CEOWORLD list and other sources indicate that individuals with net worths in the range of $10-15 billion are typically ranked around the 200-250 mark[2][3].\n\n## Historical Context and Philanthropy\nSoros has donated more than $32 billion to the Open Society Foundations, which has significantly reduced his net worth over the years. However, his current net worth of $6.7 billion is still substantial[4].\n\n## Market Fluctuations\nThe net worth of billionaires can fluctuate based on market conditions, but a net worth of $6.7 billion is generally stable enough to keep him within the top 400, given that individuals with net worths around $10-15 billion are well within this range.\n\nGiven these points, it is highly likely that George Soros will remain among the top 400 richest people in the world on December 31, 2024, based on his current net worth and the general stability of his financial position. However, the exact ranking could vary slightly due to market fluctuations and other economic factors.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has George Soros's net worth increased since October 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not offer any information on George Soros's net worth specifically for or after October 2024. The most recent updates on his net worth are as of September or October 2023, and there is no data available to determine if his net worth has increased since then[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the net worth required to be ranked 400th on the Forbes list increasing significantly?\nANSWER: Yes, the net worth required to be ranked on the Forbes 400 list is increasing significantly. For the 2024 list, the minimum net worth required to make the cut is $3.3 billion, which is a record high and $400 million more than the threshold for the 2023 list[2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any new billionaires entered the Forbes list since October 2024 who could push George Soros down in the rankings?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of new billionaires entering the Forbes 400 list after October 2024. The sources discuss the 2024 Forbes 400 list as it stood in October 2024, but they do not provide information about any changes or new entries after that date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** because the sources do not include information about new billionaires entering the list after October 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have global market conditions since October 2024 favored the growth of George Soros's investments?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe provided sources do not offer specific information about global market conditions or the performance of George Soros's investments since October 2024. The most recent data available in the sources is from Q2 2024, and there is no mention of market conditions or investment performance for the period after October 2024[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are any of George Soros's major investments experiencing significant losses as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information as of November 2024 indicating that any of George Soros's major investments are experiencing significant losses at this time.\n\n- The sources discuss various investment activities and portfolio changes, such as selling stakes in Alphabet and Amazon, and restructuring efforts like closing the Hong Kong office, but they do not mention current significant losses in his major investments[2][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is George Soros planning any major financial transactions before December 31, 2024, that could affect his net worth?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that George Soros is planning any major financial transactions before December 31, 2024, that could affect his net worth.\n\n- The sources discuss his current holdings, past transactions, and his involvement in the potential acquisition of Audacy radio stations through a bankruptcy deal. However, they do not provide details on any upcoming or planned financial transactions that would occur before the end of 2024[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is George Soros currently ranked in the top 400 richest people in the world according to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, we cannot determine George Soros's current ranking on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List specifically. The sources mention his net worth and provide some context about his wealth, but they do not specify his ranking on the Forbes list.\n\n- The Wikipedia article and the Bloomberg Billionaires Index provide his net worth but do not mention his ranking on the Forbes list[3][4].\n- The Investopedia article lists the top 10 richest people but does not include George Soros in that list, and it does not provide a comprehensive ranking beyond the top 10[1].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has George Soros made any significant charitable donations since October 2024 that could decrease his net worth?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about charitable donations made by George Soros since October 2024 that would decrease his net worth.\n\n- The most recent information about significant charitable commitments from the Open Society Foundations is from December 2023, where it was announced that $50 million would be committed to increase civic engagement among women and young people over the next three years (2024-2026)[1].\n- There is no mention of any charitable donations made after October 2024 in the sources provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any legal or regulatory issues affecting George Soros's wealth as of November 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 2024, there are several contexts that might imply or suggest legal or regulatory implications affecting George Soros's initiatives and associated entities, but they do not directly target his personal wealth.\n\n1. **District Attorney Elections and Legal Challenges**: While George Soros's funded district attorneys have faced significant electoral setbacks and legal challenges, these issues are more related to the policies and outcomes of the prosecutors he has supported rather than direct legal or regulatory issues affecting his personal wealth[3][4].\n\n2. **Operational Changes and Restructuring**: There are mentions of operational overhauls and restructuring within the Open Society Foundations and Soros Fund Management, such as the closure of the Hong Kong office, but these are administrative and strategic decisions rather than responses to legal or regulatory issues[1][5].\n\nGiven the information, there is no clear evidence of specific legal or regulatory issues directly affecting George Soros's personal wealth as of November 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it common for George Soros's net worth to fluctuate significantly in short periods?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, George Soros's net worth can indeed fluctuate, but these fluctuations are often a result of his investment strategies and market conditions rather than short-term volatility in his overall net worth.\n\nHere are some key points:\n- Soros's net worth is largely influenced by the performance of his hedge funds, particularly the Quantum Fund. Significant gains or losses in these funds can impact his net worth, but these are typically tied to major market events or his strategic bets rather than short-term market fluctuations[2][4][5].\n- While Soros has experienced substantial losses in certain periods, such as the 1987 market crash or his failed speculative attack on Hong Kong in 1998, these losses are not described as frequent short-term fluctuations but rather as outcomes of specific high-stakes trades[1][5].\n- The sources do not indicate frequent or significant short-term fluctuations in his net worth. Instead, they highlight his long-term investment strategies and the impact of major economic events on his wealth.\n\nTherefore, it is not common for George Soros's net worth to fluctuate significantly in short periods due to the nature of his investment strategies and the scale at which he operates.\n\n**NO**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately 50 days remain until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nAs of October 8, 2024, George Soros is ranked **424th** on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List. If nothing changed between now and December 31, 2024, he would remain outside the top 400. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith about **12 days** remaining, significant shifts in net worth rankings are less likely. I would assign a lower probability to George Soros entering the top 400, perhaps around **10%**.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nWith approximately **200 days** remaining, there's more time for potential changes in net worth due to market movements or major financial events. I would assign a slightly higher probability, perhaps around **20%**, to him reaching the top 400.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of October 8, 2024, George Soros is ranked **424th** on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List with a net worth of **$6.7 billion**. There is no clear evidence indicating that his net worth has increased significantly since then. Several factors contribute to the assessment:\n\n- **Net Worth Stability:** Soros's net worth has remained relatively stable, and there are no reports of substantial gains or losses in his investments since October 2024.\n\n- **Market Fluctuations:** While market conditions can impact the net worth of billionaires, significant changes within a short period (50 days) are less probable unless driven by major market events or personal financial transactions.\n\n- **Competition at the Bottom of the Top 400:** The rankings near the 400th position are highly competitive, with small differences in net worth separating individuals. The net worth required to be ranked 400th is increasing, and there is a constant influx of new wealth, especially from tech entrepreneurs and emerging markets.\n\n- **Lack of Major Financial Movements:** There are no indications that Soros is planning significant financial transactions, acquisitions, or divestments that could appreciably boost his net worth before December 31, 2024.\n\n- **Charitable Donations:** Soros is known for his philanthropy. While there are no reports of new significant donations since October 2024, any unexpected large donation could reduce his net worth further.\n\nGiven these points, while it's not impossible for George Soros to move into the top 400, the likelihood within the next 50 days is relatively low. Unexpected market events or financial activities by Soros could alter this outcome, but based on current information, such changes are improbable.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
