    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore January 5, 2025, will the KP lineage constitute less than 50% of the COVID-19 variants monitored in the US?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves **Yes** if before January 5, 2025, according to CDC's [variant proportions page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions)  the combined weighted estimate for all KP variants in the United States is below 50% in any period ending between November 9, 2024, and January 4, 2025, inclusive. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nAny subsequent revisions to the data after the question is resolved will not be considered.\n\nCDC currently reports two week periods, which will be used unless the reporting period changes. If the reporting period changes, the new reporting period will be used. If multiple reporting periods are available, the one nearest to the two week period will be used, as determined by Metaculus.\n\nThis question resolves according to the \"Weighted\" estimate and will not use the \"Nowcast\" estimate.\n\nThe HHS region used will be \"USA\".\n\nThe central estimate reported will be used when determining the variant share.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of the CDC's [variant proportions Nowcast](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions) for October 26, 2024,  the KP lineage had a combined estimate of 68% of sequenced variants in the United States for the two-week period ending on that date. As an [offshoot](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/kp2-now-dominant-covid-variant-experts-us-summer/story?id=110166187) of the [omicron variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant), KP (specifically KP.2 at the time) [first reached](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7342a1.htm) >10% prevalence in April 2024. KP.3.1.1 [became](https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/kp-3-1-1-is-the-predominant-variant.html) the predominant variant in August 2024. \n\nRecently another new COVID variant has been rapidly [growing](https://www.goerie.com/story/news/2024/10/22/what-is-covid-19-variant-xec-spreading-in-pennsylvania/75794702007/) in the United States, the XEC variant, which is estimated at 17% according to the October 26th Nowcast. This is a sharp increase from the two-week period ended September 14, 2024, when it was 2%. Even at 17% following its rapid gains, XEC is still a distant second to KP.3.1.1, which is 57% according to the Nowcast. However, results from [one recent study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.16.618773v1) \"suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1.\"\n\nAt the time of this question, CDC estimates variant proportions using two-week periods, using two different calculations: weighted estimates and Nowcast estimates. According [to CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions):\n\n>Weighted estimates (provided for all two-week periods except the most recent two, two-week periods) are variant proportions that are based on empirical (observed) genomic sequencing data. These estimates are not available for the most recent two-week periods because of the time it takes to generate the sequencing data, including sample collection, specimen treatment, shipping, analysis, and upload into public databases.\n\n>Lineages with weighted estimates less than 1% of all circulating variants are combined with their parent lineage. When the weighted estimate of a lineage crosses the 1% threshold and has substitutions in the spike protein that could affect vaccine efficacy, transmission, or severity, it may be separated from its parent lineage and displayed on its own in the variant proportions data.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n>Nowcast estimates (provided for the most recent two two-week periods when the \"Nowcast on\" option is selected below) are model-based projections of variant proportions for the most recent two-week periods to enable timely public health action. CDC uses the Nowcast to forecast variant proportions before the weighted estimates are available for a given two-week period.\n\nDue to the greater reliability,  verifiability, and empirical basis of the Weighted estimate, this question resolves based on that figure.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the KP lineage of COVID-19 variants will constitute less than 50% of the variants monitored in the US before January 5, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Prevalence\nAs of October 26, 2024, the KP.3.1.1 variant, which is a descendant of the KP.3 variant, represents 54-60% of the viruses nationally in the US.\n\n## Trends in Variant Circulation\n- The KP.3.1.1 variant, although still dominant, has shown a slowing in its increase.\n- Other variants such as XEC, a hybrid of two JN.1 variants, are increasing and represent 14-22% of the viruses.\n- Another variant, MC.1, a descendant of KP.3.1.1, is also increasing but currently represents only 3-7% of the viruses.\n\n## Evolution and Surveillance\n- The CDC and other health agencies are continuously monitoring the emergence and spread of new variants through genomic surveillance. This surveillance helps in understanding the changing landscape of COVID-19 variants.\n\n## Vaccine Impact\n- The updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccines are designed to protect against the currently circulating variants, including those from the KP lineage. However, the effectiveness of these vaccines against emerging variants can influence the prevalence of different strains.\n\nGiven the current data:\n- The KP lineage, particularly KP.3.1.1, is still dominant but showing signs of slowing growth.\n- Other variants like XEC and MC.1 are on the rise.\n- The dynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 variants means that changes in prevalence can occur rapidly.\n\nWhile it is possible that the KP lineage could drop below 50% due to the increasing presence of other variants, the current data does not definitively indicate this will happen before January 5, 2025. The trend of slowing growth in KP.3.1.1 and the rise of other variants suggests a potential shift, but the exact timing and extent of this shift are uncertain.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the KP lineage will constitute less than 50% of the COVID-19 variants before January 5, 2025, is not immediately clear based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have public health experts predicted that the KP lineage will drop below 50% prevalence in the US before January 5, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit prediction or indication from public health experts that the KP lineage will drop below 50% prevalence in the US before January 5, 2025. The sources discuss the current prevalence and trends of the KP lineage variants, such as KP.3.1.1, but do not provide forecasts or predictions for their future prevalence levels specifically up to January 5, 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the XEC variant have mutations that enable it to evade immunity from prior infection or vaccination?\nANSWER: Yes, the XEC variant does have mutations that enable it to evade immunity from prior infection or vaccination.\n\n- The XEC variant has shown a high ability to evade some of the antibodies created due to previous vaccination or infection, which gives it an advantage in dealing with the host's immune system. This is attributed to changes in the variant's spike protein that allow it to bypass some of the defenses created by previous vaccinations.\n\n- Specifically, studies indicate that the mutations in the XEC variant reduce the full protective effectiveness of existing vaccines, especially in preventing primary infection, although the vaccines still provide some level of protection against severe disease and hospitalization.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the XEC variant's prevalence among COVID-19 variants in the US increased since October 26, 2024?\nANSWER: The information available does not provide a direct comparison of the XEC variant's prevalence before and after October 26, 2024, to definitively conclude if its prevalence has increased since that date.\n\nAs of October 26, 2024, the XEC variant accounted for 14-22% of viruses in the U.S., according to the CDC.\n\nHowever, there is no specific data provided in the sources that shows the prevalence of the XEC variant after October 26, 2024, to compare and determine if it has increased.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous dominant COVID-19 variants in the US been overtaken by new variants within a two-month period?\nANSWER: Yes, previous dominant COVID-19 variants in the US have been overtaken by new variants within a two-month period.\n\nFor example, the KP.3 lineage viruses, which include KP.3.1.1, began rising since the end of March and by early June, they overtook KP.2 as the dominant variants. Specifically, KP.3.1.1, an offshoot of the KP.3 family, overtaken KP.3 and became the predominant variant in a relatively short period.\n\nAdditionally, the emergence of the XEC variant, which first appeared in June 2024 and quickly spread, indicates that new variants can rise to prominence rapidly, potentially overtaking previous dominant variants within a short timeframe.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are any other COVID-19 variants besides XEC and MC.1 rapidly increasing in prevalence in the US as of November 4, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 4, 2024, besides the XEC and MC.1 variants, there are other COVID-19 variants that are notable in their prevalence and trends in the US.\n\n- The KP.3.1.1 variant, a descendant of KP.3, is still the top variant in the United States, representing 54–60% of viruses nationally, although its increase has slowed.\n- There is no indication that other variants besides XEC and MC.1 are rapidly increasing in prevalence. Instead, the focus is on the ongoing presence and slow changes in the prevalence of variants like KP.3.1.1 and the rising but still relatively low prevalence of XEC and MC.1.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, there are no other COVID-19 variants rapidly increasing in prevalence besides XEC and MC.1 as of November 4, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the KP lineage's proportion among COVID-19 variants in the US decreased since October 26, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available information, the answer to whether the KP lineage's proportion among COVID-19 variants in the US has decreased since October 26, 2024, is somewhat nuanced but can be clarified as follows:\n\nAs of October 26, 2024, KP.3.1.1 was the top variant in the United States, representing 54–60% of viruses nationally, and its increases had slowed.\n\nBy November 1, 2024, the CDC reported that while KP.3.1.1 was still the top variant, its proportion had not increased further and was instead stable or slightly decreasing, with XEC and other variants increasing in proportion.\n\nTherefore, the proportion of the KP lineage, specifically KP.3.1.1, among COVID-19 variants in the US has not significantly increased and may have slightly decreased or stabilized since October 26, 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the KP lineage declining in prevalence in other countries where the XEC variant is present?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the KP lineage, specifically variants like KP.3.1.1 and KP.3.3, is still prevalent but appears to be facing a challenge from the rising XEC variant.\n\n- In the US, KP.3.1.1 is currently the dominant variant, making up about 57.2% of SARS-CoV-2 viruses, but XEC is rising, making up about 10.7% of sequenced samples.\n- In Europe and North America, KP.3.1.1 is the dominant variant, but XEC is spreading faster and is predicted to become the dominant variant in the near future.\n- The XEC variant has a growth advantage over other circulating variants, including those from the KP lineage, suggesting that as XEC continues to spread, the prevalence of KP lineage variants may decline.\n\nTherefore, it can be inferred that the KP lineage is likely declining in prevalence in other countries where the XEC variant is present, as XEC is expected to become the dominant variant.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence that the XEC variant is more transmissible than the KP.3.1.1 variant?\nANSWER: There is evidence suggesting that the XEC variant may have a transmission advantage over the KP.3.1.1 variant, although the conclusions are not unanimous across all sources.\n\n1. **Increased Reproduction Number**: A study from the Sato Lab at the University of Tokyo found that the reproduction number of XEC is greater than that of KP.3.1.1, indicating a higher potential for transmission.\n\n2. **Growth Advantage**: Reports mention that XEC has a growth advantage over other circulating variants, including KP.3.1.1, and is spreading rapidly in several regions.\n\n3. **Specific Mutations**: The XEC variant contains specific spike protein mutations (such as T22N and Q493E) that could enhance its transmissibility, although the exact impact of these mutations is still under investigation.\n\nHowever, some experts caution that the evidence is not yet conclusive and that other factors, such as timing and circumstances (like the founder effect), could also contribute to its spread.\n\nGiven the preponderance of evidence suggesting a higher reproduction number and growth advantage, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the US conducting sufficient genomic surveillance to detect rapid shifts in COVID-19 variant proportions?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that the US is actively engaged in robust genomic surveillance to detect and track COVID-19 variants.\n\n- The CDC has established multiple pipelines to connect genomic sequence data from various sources, including public health laboratories and commercial diagnostic laboratories, and makes this data available in publicly accessible databases.\n- The CDC's National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3) System collects, analyzes, and shares information about the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, tracking virus evolution and identifying emerging variants that could impact diagnostics, therapeutics, or vaccines.\n- Public health laboratories in the US send representative SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical specimens to the CDC on a bi-weekly basis for sequencing, genetic analysis, and phenotypic characterization, which supports a comprehensive surveillance system.\n- The use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) and variant PCR, as well as the implementation of a genomic surveillance response playbook, further enhances the ability to detect and respond to emerging variants in a timely manner.\n\nGiven these detailed and structured efforts, it can be concluded that the US is conducting sufficient genomic surveillance to detect rapid shifts in COVID-19 variant proportions.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current rate of COVID-19 vaccination in the US low enough to facilitate the spread of new variants?\nANSWER: The current rate of COVID-19 vaccination in the US, as described in the sources, suggests several factors that could contribute to the spread of new variants, although it does not definitively prove that the rate is low enough to facilitate this spread.\n\n1. **Vaccination Rates**: The overall vaccination rates for COVID-19 have been significant, with 81% of the population having received at least one dose and 70% considered fully vaccinated. However, the uptake of the updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine is relatively low, with only 14.8% of adults and 6.1% of children having received it as of recent data.\n\n2. **Declining Public Concern and Vaccination Uptake**: There has been a decline in public concern about COVID-19, and consequently, a lower uptake of the updated vaccines. Only 28% of U.S. adults have received the updated COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n3. **Vaccine Hesitancy and Exemptions**: Vaccine hesitancy and increased exemptions from school vaccination requirements have been noted, which can lead to clusters of unvaccinated individuals and increase the risk of outbreaks.\n\nGiven these points, while the historical vaccination rates have been high, the current low uptake of the updated COVID-19 vaccine and the presence of vaccine hesitancy could create conditions that facilitate the spread of new variants. However, the sources do not provide a definitive conclusion on whether the current rate is specifically low enough to facilitate this spread.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately 2 months (from November 4, 2024, to January 5, 2025).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf nothing changed, the KP lineage would remain above 50% prevalence. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith only about 15 days left, I would forecast a lower probability that the KP lineage would drop below 50%, around **20%**.\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\nWith approximately 8 months remaining, I would forecast a higher probability that the KP lineage would drop below 50%, around **80%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of October 26, 2024, the KP lineage, particularly the KP.3.1.1 variant, constitutes about 68% of COVID-19 variants in the U.S. However, the growth of KP.3.1.1 is slowing. In contrast, the XEC variant has shown a rapid increase, rising from 2% prevalence on September 14 to 17% on October 26—a significant jump in a short period.\n\nHistorically, new dominant variants have overtaken previous ones within a two-month period. The XEC variant possesses mutations that enhance its transmissibility and ability to evade immunity from prior infections or vaccinations. This gives it a growth advantage over the KP lineage.\n\nGiven the two months remaining until January 5, 2025, there is sufficient time for the XEC variant to continue its rapid ascent. If the current trends persist, it's plausible that the KP lineage's share could drop below 50% as XEC and potentially other emerging variants increase in prevalence.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. is conducting sufficient genomic surveillance to detect such shifts, and the relatively low uptake of the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccines may facilitate the spread of new variants like XEC.\n\nConsidering all these factors—the slowing dominance of the KP lineage, the rapid rise of XEC, historical precedent, and the time frame—I estimate a moderate likelihood that the KP lineage will constitute less than 50% of monitored variants before January 5, 2025.\n\n**Probability: 60%**",
