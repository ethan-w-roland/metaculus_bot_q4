    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill marijuana still be listed as a US Schedule I controlled substance on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve **Yes** if, on December 31, 2024, marijuana is listed as a schedule I drug in the US according to Wikipedia's list, which can be currently accessed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Schedule_I_controlled_substances_(U.S.)). If marijuana is not on the list, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Victoria Litman, M.Div., J.D., LL.M. writing at Harvard Law School's [Bill of Health blog](https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2024/05/28/what-you-need-to-know-about-marijuana-rescheduling/): \n\n>On May 21, 2024, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) signed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in the Federal Register. This publication kicks off a 62-day comment period on a rule that would move marijuana to Schedule 3 of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), classifying it as a substance with “a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.” The process of rescheduling may be long and is unlikely to create a pathway to federal compliance for state-legal marijuana businesses without further federal legislation. Ultimately, Congress likely will need to clarify the division of federal and state regulatory powers over cannabis.\n\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether marijuana will still be listed as a US Schedule I controlled substance on December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Status and Proposal\nAs of May 2024, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has proposed a rule to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)[1][3][4].\n\n## Process and Timeline\nThe proposal is currently in the public comment period, which was anticipated to last 60 days from the publication in the Federal Register on May 21, 2024. After this period, there will be a public hearing in early 2025 to gather further evidence and expert opinions. Following the hearing, an administrative law judge will write a report, and the DEA will then review this report to make a final decision on the rescheduling[4].\n\n## Time to Resolution\nGiven the steps involved, including the public comment period, the public hearing, and the subsequent review by the DEA, it is unlikely that the rescheduling process will be completed by December 31, 2024. The process is expected to take several months or even years, as indicated by the historical context of previous rescheduling attempts[3][4].\n\n## Historical Context\nPrevious petitions to reschedule marijuana have been denied, and the current process is complex and time-consuming. The DEA has received over 43,000 comments on the proposed rule, which will need to be reviewed, adding to the time required for a final decision[4].\n\nBased on this information, it is highly probable that marijuana will still be listed as a US Schedule I controlled substance on December 31, 2024, given the ongoing nature of the rescheduling process and the time required for its completion.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the public comment period for the DEA's rescheduling proposal conclude before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe public comment period for the DEA's proposed rescheduling of cannabis concluded on July 22, 2024, which is well before December 31, 2024[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) finalized the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that the process of rescheduling marijuana is ongoing and involves several steps, including a hearing scheduled for December 2, 2024, and subsequent evaluations and rulemaking. There is no indication that the DEA will finalize the proposed rule by December 31, 2024, as the process is expected to take several months or even years to complete[3][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous petitions to reschedule marijuana been approved by the DEA?\nANSWER: No, previous petitions to reschedule marijuana have not been approved by the DEA. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- Prior petitions for marijuana rescheduling have been denied, notably in 2001, 2011, and 2016, primarily due to the DEA’s criteria for “currently accepted medical use” (CAMU)[2][4][5].\n- Despite favorable rulings or recommendations in some cases, such as the 1988 ruling by the DEA’s Administrative Law Judge, these decisions were ultimately set aside or denied by higher authorities[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the number of public comments received by the DEA exceed typical thresholds for delays in rescheduling decisions?\nANSWER: The number of public comments received by the DEA in this case was significantly high and exceeded typical thresholds. According to the sources, the DEA received around 42,000 comments during the 60-day public comment period, with over 90% of these comments supporting the reform[1][3][4].\n\nThis volume of comments is unusual and indicates a high level of public interest and engagement, which is not typically seen in most rescheduling decisions. Therefore, the number of public comments did indeed exceed typical thresholds for delays in rescheduling decisions.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the DEA conducted a public hearing on the rescheduling proposal by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the DEA has scheduled a preliminary hearing on the rescheduling of marijuana, which is set to begin on December 2, 2024. However, this preliminary hearing is not for witness testimony but to address legal and logistical issues and to set future dates for the evidentiary hearing on the merits[1][2][3].\n\nThe in-person testimony, which is a crucial part of the public hearing, is not scheduled to begin until early next year, specifically in January or February 2025[3].\n\nTherefore, the DEA has not conducted a public hearing involving witness testimony by December 31, 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Congress passed legislation clarifying the division of federal and state regulatory powers over cannabis by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether Congress has passed legislation clarifying the division of federal and state regulatory powers over cannabis by December 31, 2024.\n\n- The sources indicate that various bills and proposals are in different stages of consideration, such as the 2024 Farm Bill, the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, and other incremental reform bills. However, none of the sources confirm that any of these bills have been passed into law as of the current date[1][3][4].\n- The legislative process is ongoing, with some bills still in committee or awaiting further action, and there is no definitive statement that any of these have been enacted by the end of 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have federal judges issued rulings that impact the rescheduling of marijuana by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that the process of rescheduling marijuana has been ongoing, but there have been no final rulings issued by federal judges that would impact the rescheduling of marijuana by December 31, 2024.\n\n- The hearing originally scheduled for December 2, 2024, has been delayed to early 2025, with in-person testimony now expected to begin in January or February 2025[3][4][5].\n- The current proceedings are still in the preliminary stages, with the December 2, 2024, hearing serving only as a procedural day to address legal and logistical issues, and not involving any witness testimony[5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there substantial opposition from federal or state authorities to rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III?\nANSWER: Yes, there is substantial opposition from both federal and state authorities to rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III.\n\n- A coalition of 11 state attorneys general, including those from Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, South Carolina, and South Dakota, have submitted a public comment letter opposing the rescheduling, citing it as unlawful and ill-advised[2].\n- Twenty-five lawmakers, including Senator James Langford and Representative Pete Sessions, have signed a letter opposing the Biden administration’s proposal, arguing it is politically motivated and not based on science or data[3].\n- Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) and other prohibitionist groups are actively opposing the rescheduling and are considering legal options to challenge the proposed change[1].\n- Various law enforcement agencies and public health experts have also expressed opposition, highlighting concerns about increased substance abuse, complications in regulating other illicit drugs, and potential public health consequences[1][5].\n\nThese sources indicate significant opposition from various federal and state authorities.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the DEA expedited the review process for the marijuana rescheduling proposal?\nANSWER: While the DEA and the Biden administration have taken several steps to advance the process of rescheduling marijuana, it is not entirely clear that the review process has been significantly expedited in the traditional sense.\n\nHere are some key points:\n- The process was initiated by President Biden in October 2022, and there have been several expedited actions, such as the HHS recommendation in August 2023 and the DEA's ongoing review[2][3][4].\n- However, the DEA has decided to hold an administrative hearing on December 2, 2024, which suggests that the final rulemaking may not occur before the November election and could potentially delay the process[3][4][5].\n- Despite the hopes for a faster process, the inclusion of a public hearing and the potential for further reviews and comments indicates that the process is still following the standard procedural steps, albeit with some urgency due to political and public interest[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, while there is a sense of urgency and some expedited actions, the process is still adhering to the necessary legal and administrative procedures, which does not constitute a full expediation of the review process.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant legal challenges to the DEA's rescheduling process by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: By December 31, 2024, there have been several significant legal and procedural challenges to the DEA's rescheduling process of marijuana:\n\n1. **Motion to Remove DEA**: A legal filing has been submitted to remove the DEA from its role in the rescheduling hearing due to alleged statutory violations, including unlawful communication with a prohibitionist group[1].\n\n2. **Allegations of Improper Communications**: The motion also highlights improper ex parte communications between the DEA and private parties, which could compromise the integrity of the process[1].\n\n3. **Request for Postponement**: A researcher has filed a motion to postpone the rescheduling hearing due to the DEA's alleged \"improper blocking\" of witnesses and to wait until the new administration can review the rulemaking[1].\n\n4. **Insufficient Information from Witnesses**: The DEA Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) has delayed the hearing to early 2025 because the information provided on the selected witnesses was insufficient, requiring additional details[3].\n\n5. **Criticism of DEA's Approach**: There have been criticisms regarding the DEA's approach to the rescheduling notice, with some arguing it violates federal statute by flagging necessary data after the proposed rule was published[1].\n\nThese challenges indicate significant legal and procedural hurdles in the rescheduling process by the end of 2024.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nThere are 32 days remaining from November 29, 2024, until December 31, 2024.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf the current process continues without any changes, marijuana would remain listed as a US Schedule I controlled substance on December 31, 2024.\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only 8 days left, there would be virtually no change in the status. The probability that marijuana remains Schedule I would remain extremely high, essentially unchanged from the current forecast.\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith approximately 128 days until the outcome date, there would still likely be insufficient time to complete the rescheduling process, especially considering the procedural steps outlined by the DEA. The probability might see a very minimal decrease, but it would still remain overwhelmingly in favor of marijuana staying Schedule I.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nGiven the timeline of the DEA's rescheduling process, including the public comment period ended in July 2024, scheduled hearings in early 2025, and historical delays in such administrative procedures, it is highly improbable that marijuana's scheduling status would change by December 31, 2024. Additionally, substantial opposition from federal and state authorities, along with ongoing legal challenges, further diminishes the likelihood of rescheduling within the remaining timeframe. Even if some expedited actions were taken, the procedural and legislative hurdles present significant barriers to completing the rescheduling process within the next month.\n\n**Probability: 95%**",
