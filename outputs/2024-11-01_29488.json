    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill it rain more than 200mm in Bras칤lia, Brazil in December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves based on the amount of measured and recorded cumulative rainfall (in millimeters) at the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) weather station [83377] BRASILIA - DF for the month of December 2024.\n\nDETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Go to the INMET weather station map [here](https://mapas.inmet.gov.br/).\n2. Click the 游댌search icon on the left side of the screen.\n3. Paste this into the search box: [83377] BRASILIA - DF\n4. Click on the blue dot to access the weather station.\n\nTo access the precipitation data, click on \"Tabela\". The question will resolve based on the total *Chuva (mm)* for the month of December 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf the resolution source is unavailable or data have not been released for every day of December, resolution will wait until January 7, 2025 for the data to be available, at which point if they still are not available, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nThis question resolves based on the values shown when accessed by Metaculus after the data for December 31 are first released. Further revisions to the data will not be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBras칤lia, the capital city of Brazil, has [just had rain](https://brazilian.report/liveblog/politics-insider/2024/10/07/brasilia-longest-drought-ever/) after a record-breaking drought, characterized by 167 consecutive days of no rain. September 2024 was the [hottest September on record](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/noticias/brasil-tem-o-setembro-mais-quente-em-63-anos) for the area, and INMET expects 2024 to be one of the top 5 hottest years, which has also caused a surge in wildfires.\n\nDecember is typically the [wettest month](https://avionero.com/New-York-Brasilia.NYC-BSB/weather/december) for Bras칤lia, with rain averaging about 253 mm and an average of 21 rainy days in the month. See also [Weatherspark](https://weatherspark.com/y/30238/Average-Weather-in-Bras%C3%ADlia-Federal-District-Brazil-Year-Round), which found an average of about 215 mm and about 75% of days having at least 1 mm of rain.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine the likelihood of Bras칤lia, Brazil receiving more than 200mm of rainfall in December 2024, here are some key points from the available information:\n\n## Historical Rainfall Patterns\n- Bras칤lia experiences a pronounced wet season from October to April, with December being one of the wettest months. Historically, December and January are the months with the highest rainfall, often exceeding 200mm.\n\n## Average Rainfall in December\n- The average monthly rainfall in December is typically around 253mm, according to historical data.\n- Another source confirms that the wettest months, including December, often see monthly rainfall exceeding 200mm.\n\n## Climate and Weather Averages\n- Bras칤lia's climate is characterized by a tropical savanna climate with distinct wet and dry seasons. The wet season, which includes December, is marked by significant rainfall.\n\nGiven these points, it is highly likely that Bras칤lia will receive more than 200mm of rainfall in December 2024, based on historical averages and typical weather patterns for the region. Therefore, the answer to whether it will rain more than 200mm in Bras칤lia in December 2024 can be inferred as **yes**, given the consistent historical data.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average December rainfall in Bras칤lia historically over 200mm?\nANSWER: Yes, the average December rainfall in Bras칤lia is historically over 200mm. According to the sources, December averages around 240 mm (9.4 in) of rainfall.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bras칤lia experienced a drought lasting over 150 consecutive days before 2024?\nANSWER: No, Bras칤lia had not experienced a drought lasting over 150 consecutive days before 2024. The longest drought on record in Bras칤lia prior to 2024 was 164 days, which was surpassed in 2024 when the city experienced a 167-day drought.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bras칤lia's December rainfall shown significant variability in recent decades?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no specific data or analysis provided that directly addresses the variability of December rainfall in Bras칤lia over recent decades.\n\n- The source from Weatherspark provides general information about the climate and average weather in Bras칤lia, including the fact that December is the month with the most rain, but it does not discuss variability over recent decades.\n- The other sources discuss climate trends and variability in Brazil more broadly, but they do not focus specifically on Bras칤lia's December rainfall.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Bras칤lia's December rainfall has shown significant variability in recent decades is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: In previous years when Bras칤lia had prolonged droughts, did December rainfall exceed 200mm?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about the rainfall amounts in December for previous years of prolonged droughts in Bras칤lia.\n\n- The source from The Brazilian Report mentions a record-breaking drought in Bras칤lia in 2024 but does not provide historical rainfall data for December.\n- The other sources discuss various climate and hydrological events in Brazil, but they do not provide the specific rainfall data for December in Bras칤lia during previous droughts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the end of the 2024 drought in Bras칤lia led to expectations of a delayed wet season?\nANSWER: The sources do not indicate that the end of the 2024 drought in Bras칤lia has led to expectations of a delayed wet season specifically for Bras칤lia or the broader region. The drought in Bras칤lia ended with rainfall on October 7, 2024, but the discussions about the wet season and its timing are more general and related to the broader Amazon region rather than Bras칤lia specifically.\n\nFor example, the sources mention that the drought could worsen or that the wet season might be delayed in the Amazon region due to factors like El Ni침o and climate change, but they do not link this directly to the end of the drought in Bras칤lia.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are climate forecasts predicting below-average rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication that climate forecasts are predicting below-average rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- December is noted as one of the wettest months in Bras칤lia, with high rainfall. For example, mentions that December has the highest number of rainy days (27.5 days) and states that the average rainfall in December is 253 mm, which is one of the highest amounts.\n- There is no mention in any of the sources of below-average rainfall predictions for December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (since there is no specific forecast provided for 2024, but historical data suggests high rainfall in December).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are meteorological agencies predicting normal or above-normal rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the predictions for rainfall in Bras칤lia in December 2024 indicate the following:\n\n- There are usually 26 days with some rain in Bras칤lia in December, and the average monthly rainfall is 261mm.\n- The average sliding 31-day rainfall during December in Bras칤lia is essentially constant, remaining about 8.4 inches (approximately 213mm).\n- December still maintains substantial rain, with rainfall easing slightly from November to 181mm (7.13\") in Bras칤lia.\n\nThese figures are consistent with the typical rainfall patterns for December in Bras칤lia, which is one of the wetter months. Therefore, the rainfall predictions for December 2024 are in line with normal or expected rainfall levels for this time of year.\n\n**YES**, meteorological agencies are predicting normal rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have wildfires associated with drought conditions historically affected Bras칤lia's rainfall patterns?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not offer direct historical evidence of how wildfires associated with drought conditions have specifically affected Bras칤lia's rainfall patterns in the past. However, they do explain the broader impact of deforestation and drought on rainfall patterns in Brazil.\n\n- Deforestation, which is often linked to wildfires, alters rainfall patterns across Brazil, including regions far beyond the deforestation areas. This is because the Amazon rainforest plays a crucial role in producing and regulating rainfall through tree transpiration.\n- The current drought and wildfires are part of a larger ecological disruption that affects rainfall, but the sources do not provide specific historical data on how these conditions have impacted Bras칤lia's rainfall patterns over time.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether wildfires associated with drought conditions have historically affected Bras칤lia's rainfall patterns is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an El Ni침o or La Ni침a event expected to influence Brazil's rainfall in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is an expectation of a La Ni침a event that could influence Brazil's rainfall in December 2024.\n\n- A La Ni침a event is predicted to emerge in the last quarter of 2024 and is likely to persist until March 2025. This event is expected to bring rainfall anomalies, including drier conditions in southern Brazil during the June-July-August months, but for the December-January-February period, it is anticipated to affect Central and South America with typical precipitation anomalies.\n- Specifically, regions like northern Brazil could witness increased precipitation, while southern Brazil might experience drier conditions during different parts of the year. However, for December 2024, the expectation is for varied rainfall patterns across Brazil, with some areas potentially experiencing increased precipitation due to La Ni침a.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do higher-than-average temperatures correlate with reduced rainfall in Bras칤lia's December?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear correlation between higher-than-average temperatures and reduced rainfall in Bras칤lia during December.\n\n- The sources indicate that December is a month with significant rainfall in Bras칤lia. For example, there is a 55% chance of rain on an average day in December, with an average of 0.75 inches (18.9 mm) of precipitation, or approximately 194 mm of total rainfall for the month.\n- The temperature in December is described as pleasantly warm, with average highs around 80-84춿F (27-29춿C) and lows around 64-66춿F (18-19춿C).\n- However, none of the sources explicitly state a correlation between higher temperatures and reduced rainfall in December. Instead, they focus on the general weather patterns and averages without drawing a specific link between temperature and rainfall.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** because the sources do not provide sufficient information to establish a correlation between higher-than-average temperatures and reduced rainfall in Bras칤lia during December.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of today, November 1, 2024, there are approximately 2 months until the end of December 2024. According to the resolution criteria, the cumulative rainfall data for December will be available by January 7, 2025. Therefore, the time left until the outcome is known is about **2 months and 1 week**.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current weather patterns and historical averages hold without significant anomalies, Bras칤lia is expected to receive more than 200mm of rainfall in December 2024. December is historically the wettest month, with average rainfall between 215mm and 253mm. Assuming typical conditions, the outcome would be **Yes**, it will rain more than 200mm.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about **two weeks** left until the outcome is known, we would be in mid-December 2024. By that time, we would have initial rainfall data for December. Assuming initial rainfall trends align with historical patterns, I would forecast a higher probability, around **85%**, that the total rainfall will exceed 200mm.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **8 months** until the outcome is known (i.e., it is now March 2024), there would be greater uncertainty due to the longer time horizon. Factors like the forthcoming wet season and potential climate anomalies would be less certain. I would forecast a slightly lower probability, around **70%**, that December 2024 rainfall will exceed 200mm.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nBras칤lia experiences a tropical savanna climate with a distinct wet season from October to April. December is historically the peak of the wet season and the wettest month of the year. Historical data indicates:\n\n- **Average December Rainfall:** Between 215mm and 253mm.\n- **Average Rainy Days in December:** Approximately 21 to 27 days.\n\n**Current Context:**\n\n- **Record-Breaking Drought:** In 2024, Bras칤lia experienced an unprecedented drought lasting 167 consecutive days without rain.\n- **Hottest September on Record:** September 2024 was the hottest in 63 years, contributing to severe wildfires.\n- **Recent Rainfall:** The drought ended on October 7, 2024, indicating the onset of the wet season.\n\n**Factors Influencing the Forecast:**\n\n1. **Historical Averages:** December consistently records rainfall well over 200mm.\n\n2. **Climate Patterns:**\n   - **El Ni침o/La Ni침a:** There is an expectation of a La Ni침a event influencing rainfall patterns in late 2024.\n   - **Impact of La Ni침a:** Typically leads to increased rainfall in northern Brazil, but the effect on Bras칤lia (central Brazil) can vary.\n\n3. **Climate Change and Extreme Weather:**\n   - **Variability:** Climate change may increase weather variability, potentially affecting rainfall patterns.\n   - **Uncertainty:** Recent extreme weather events introduce uncertainty into the forecast.\n\n4. **Soil and Atmospheric Conditions:**\n   - **Drought Effects:** Prolonged drought can impact soil moisture and atmospheric conditions, potentially influencing precipitation rates.\n\n5. **Forecast Models:**\n   - **Meteorological Predictions:** Current forecasts suggest normal to above-normal rainfall for December 2024 in Bras칤lia.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the historical precedence of high rainfall in December, the typical onset of the wet season after October, and current meteorological forecasts, it is **highly probable** that Bras칤lia will receive more than 200mm of rainfall in December 2024. However, considering the recent drought and potential impacts of climate change, there is a slight increase in uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 80%**",
