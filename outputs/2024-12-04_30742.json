    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the US national average retail price of regular gasoline between $3.020 and $3.080 (inclusive) for the week of December 9, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports Weekly U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Price of greater than or equal to $3.020 and less than or equal to $3.080 for the week of December 16, 2024.  The resolution source can be accessed through [this link](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epmr_pte_nus_dpg&f=w). If the reported figure is different, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf data from US EIA is not available, Metaculus may select a similar source of data or annul the question at their discretion. If EIA changes its reporting weeks, the week closest to the date mentioned in the Resolution Criteria will be used.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gas_proc-methods.php), \"Every Monday, EIA collects information on retail prices for regular, midgrade, and premium grades of gasoline from a sample of retail gasoline outlets across the United States using Form EIA-878, Motor Gasoline Price Survey Schedule A. The weekly survey is designed to collect data on the cash price offered at the pump (including taxes) to consumers for each grade of gasoline. The data collected represent the price as of 8:00 a.m. local time on Monday, for the self-serve price except in areas having only full-serve, and the cash price except for outlets accepting only credit cards.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the US national average retail price of regular gasoline falling between $3.020 and $3.080 for the week of December 9, 2024, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Current Prices\nAs of December 3, 2024, the national average price for regular gasoline is $3.037, according to AAA data[1][4].\n\n## Recent Trends\n- The average US gas price has been trending downward, with an 8.4% decrease from $3.37 on November 13, 2023, to $3.08 on November 13, 2024[2].\n- Prices have fluctuated but generally remained stable in recent weeks, with a current level of $3.166 as of November 25, 2024, according to yCharts data[5].\n\n## Historical Context\n- The highest average gas price in 2024 was $3.61 in April, but prices have since decreased[2].\n- The average gas price in 2023 peaked in August and September at $3.84 and then fell to a 12-month low of $3.13 in December 2023[2].\n\n## Regional Variations\n- Gas prices vary significantly by state, but the national average has been relatively stable. States like Hawaii, California, and Washington have much higher prices, while states like Oklahoma, Texas, and North Carolina have lower prices[2][4].\n\n## Forecasting Considerations\n- Given the recent stability and slight downward trend, it is plausible that the national average could remain within the specified range.\n- However, gas prices can be influenced by various factors such as global oil prices, geopolitical events, and seasonal demand, which could cause unexpected fluctuations.\n\n### Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- The current price is already within the specified range ($3.037 as of December 3, 2024), suggesting a high likelihood of it remaining so in the short term.\n- The week of December 9, 2024, is just a few days ahead, which reduces the likelihood of significant changes due to external factors.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is impossible to predict with absolute certainty, the current trends and recent stability in gas prices suggest that it is highly likely that the national average retail price of regular gasoline will remain between $3.020 and $3.080 for the week of December 9, 2024. However, this is not a definitive yes or no answer, as unforeseen events could still impact prices.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current national average price of regular gasoline reported by AAA between $3.020 and $3.080?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, the current national average price of regular gasoline reported by AAA is $3.037 per gallon as of December 3, 2024[1].\n\nSince $3.037 falls within the range of $3.020 to $3.080, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the volatility of gasoline prices in the past six months classified as low?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is not enough specific information to determine the volatility of gasoline prices over the past six months as low or otherwise.\n\n- The sources discuss historical trends, general factors influencing gasoline price volatility, and long-term observations, but they do not provide real-time or recent data specific to the past six months[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent natural disaster, such as a hurricane, that could impact oil production or distribution?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThere has been a recent natural disaster, specifically Hurricane Rafael, which is expected to impact oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. According to the sources, Hurricane Rafael could cause significant disruptions to oil and gas production, including shut-ins of offshore platforms and temporary reductions in production[1][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an increase in seasonal demand for gasoline during the upcoming winter months?\nANSWER: No, there is not an increase in seasonal demand for gasoline during the winter months. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- Gasoline demand increases from February and peaks in August, which is the summer driving season[2][3][5].\n- During the winter months, demand for gasoline is generally lower compared to the summer months[2][3][5].\n- The higher demand for energy during winter is more related to heating fuels such as heating oil and natural gas, rather than gasoline[1][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have global crude oil inventories experienced a significant change in the past few weeks?\nANSWER: Yes, global crude oil inventories have experienced significant changes in the recent period.\n\n- Global oil inventories have been declining steadily, with a notable drop in recent months. For example, global oil inventories fell by 0.9 million barrels per day (b/d) in the third quarter of 2024 and are expected to continue falling at a rate of 0.3 million b/d in the fourth quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025[2].\n- As of September, global oil inventories plunged by 47.5 million barrels, leading to their lowest level since January 2017. This trend has continued, with inventories decreasing for a fifth consecutive month in October[3].\n- Current global crude inventories stand at 4.4 billion barrels, which is the lowest on record since January 2017 and significantly below the five-year average[1][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the national average price of regular gasoline shown a downward trend in the past month?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- From the AAA Fuel Prices source, the national average price for regular gasoline on December 4, 2024, is $3.037, which is down from $3.067 a week ago and $3.103 a month ago[1].\n- The YCharts source indicates that the US Retail Gas Price has decreased from 3.363 one year ago to 3.166 as of November 25, 2024, but it does not provide specific monthly data. However, it does show a slight decrease from the previous week[2].\n- The Trading Economics source shows that gasoline prices in the United States decreased to 0.81 USD/Liter in November from 0.83 USD/Liter in October, indicating a downward trend in the past month[3].\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that the national average price of regular gasoline has shown a downward trend in the past month.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an ongoing supply disruption in major oil-producing regions affecting gasoline availability?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several factors and events that could impact oil supply, but they do not necessarily indicate an ongoing significant disruption affecting gasoline availability at the moment.\n\n- Libya's oil production was disrupted due to political unrest, but it has resumed following the resolution of the dispute[2][3][4].\n- There were production outages in Libya, but the EIA and IEA reports indicate that Libyan production is expected to average 0.6 million b/d for the remainder of the year, which is an improvement from the lows seen in August[1][2][4].\n- Field maintenance work in Kazakhstan, Norway, and Canada also reduced output, but these are scheduled and not unexpected disruptions[2][3].\n- Tensions between Israel and Iran raised fears of a broader Middle East conflict, but as of the latest reports, oil exports from Iran and neighboring countries are unaffected[3][4].\n- The US Gulf Coast experienced hurricanes, but the production losses were described as \"modest\"[3].\n\nWhile these factors introduce some uncertainty and volatility, they do not indicate a severe, ongoing supply disruption that would significantly impact gasoline availability.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major oil companies maintaining stable production levels in the coming weeks?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the answer to whether major oil companies are maintaining stable production levels in the coming weeks is somewhat mixed and depends on the specific company or region.\n\n- **Equinor**, a major Norwegian oil and gas company, has pledged to maintain stable oil and gas production levels up to 2035, including in the short term. They have highlighted several projects that support this stability[4].\n\n- **OPEC** members have been committed to maintaining market stability and have taken measures to ensure adequate supply. However, the stability can be influenced by various factors such as geopolitical risks and production cuts. OPEC+ members are expected to continue limiting production below recently announced targets, which could impact overall stability[3][5].\n\n- **U.S. crude oil production**, while at record highs, is forecasted to decline through the second and third quarters of 2024 due to winter weather and other factors, before climbing again in 2025[2].\n\nGiven these points, it is not universally clear that all major oil companies will maintain stable production levels in the coming weeks, as there are forecasts of declines and potential volatility.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent policy changes or regulations affecting gasoline prices in the United States?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent policy changes and regulations affecting gasoline prices in the United States, particularly in California.\n\n1. **Legislation to Prevent Gas Price Spikes**: Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation that allows the state to require oil refiners to maintain a minimum inventory of fuel and plan for resupply during refiner maintenance outages. This is aimed at preventing price spikes and saving consumers money at the pump[1][3].\n\n2. **Ethanol Blending**: Governor Newsom has also directed the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to expedite the study of increasing ethanol blending in gasoline, which could lower gas prices by up to $0.20 per gallon without compromising environmental protections[3].\n\n3. **Gas Tax and Environmental Policies**: While not a new policy, it's worth noting that existing gas taxes and environmental policies, such as the Low Carbon Fuel Standard and cap-and-trade program in California, continue to impact gas prices. These policies are set to continue and even increase in the future, affecting the overall cost of gasoline[4].\n\nThese changes and ongoing policies indicate active efforts to regulate and influence gasoline prices, especially in California.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant geopolitical events currently impacting global oil prices?\nANSWER: Yes, there are significant geopolitical events currently impacting global oil prices.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the influence of geopolitical tensions on oil prices:\n\n1. **Middle East Conflict**: The intensifying conflict in the Middle East, particularly involving Israel and Iran, is expected to maintain a geopolitical premium in crude oil prices until the conflict is resolved. This is due to the potential disruption of oil supplies and the low level of global oil inventories[1].\n\n2. **Geopolitical Shocks**: Geopolitical shocks, especially those involving key oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Iran, can increase oil prices by creating risks to future oil supplies. For example, geopolitical tensions associated with countries like China, Israel, Russia, and Venezuela can put upward pressure on Brent oil prices[2].\n\n3. **OPEC+ and Global Politics**: The strategies of OPEC+ members, influenced by geopolitical considerations, play a crucial role in oil price stability. Additionally, the redirection of sanctioned oil from countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela due to geopolitical factors is affecting global oil trade dynamics[4].\n\n4. **Global Oil Supply and Demand**: The World Bank's Commodity Markets Outlook notes that ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, are key risks to the oil price outlook, even as global supply levels and demand trends are also influential[5].\n\nThese factors indicate that geopolitical events are currently having a significant impact on global oil prices.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:** 12 days (from December 4, 2024, to December 16, 2024)\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions remain stable without any significant disruptions or changes, the national average retail price of regular gasoline is expected to stay around $3.037, which falls within the specified range of $3.020 to $3.080. Therefore, the outcome would likely be **Yes**.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only 3 days left until resolution, the window for significant changes is minimal. Given the current price is within the target range and no major events are anticipated in such a short period, the probability of the price remaining within the specified range would be slightly higher.  \n**Forecast:** 85%\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith 48 days until resolution, there is ample time for various factors to influence gasoline prices, including geopolitical events, natural disasters, changes in global oil inventories, and policy shifts. This extended timeframe introduces higher uncertainty, potentially causing the price to move outside the specified range.  \n**Forecast:** 60%\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe current national average retail price of regular gasoline stands at $3.037, comfortably within the target range. Recent trends indicate a slight downward movement in prices, supported by stable or decreasing global oil inventories. However, the presence of Hurricane Rafael poses a risk by potentially disrupting oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, which could exert upward pressure on prices. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and recent policy changes in states like California to prevent gas price spikes introduce both stabilizing and destabilizing factors. Given the short timeframe of 12 days, the likelihood of significant price volatility is relatively low, but not negligible due to the potential impact of Hurricane Rafael and geopolitical tensions. Balancing these factors, there is a high probability that prices will remain within the specified range, though unforeseen events could sway the outcome.\n\n**Probability: 75%**",
