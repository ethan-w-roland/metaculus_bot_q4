    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the new Prime Minister of Iceland belong to the Left-Green Movement after the 2024 parliamentary elections?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-11\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve **Yes** if the new prime minister belongs to the Left-Green Movement at the time of receiving the mandate to form a government by the President.\n\nIf, for any reason, no one has received the mandate before 1 January 2025 (including that the election is postponed or the coalition talks are ongoing), this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe [2017 parliamentary elections in Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Icelandic_parliamentary_election) resulted in an unusual governing coalition of the left-wing [Left-Green Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-Green_Movement), the centre [Progressive Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Iceland)), and the centre-right [Independence Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Party_(Iceland)). Despite the Independence Party being the largest party in the coalition, the new prime minister was [Katrín Jakobsdóttir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katr%C3%ADn_Jakobsd%C3%B3ttir), the chairperson of the Left-Green Movement.\n\nIn [2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Icelandic_parliamentary_election), the three-party coalition maintained its majority and remained governmend under the lead of Katrín Jakobsdóttir. However, Jakobsdóttir resigned in April 2024 to contest the [presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Icelandic_presidential_election), which she lost. She was succeeded as prime minister by [Bjarni Benediktsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarni_Benediktsson_(born_1970)), the leader of the Independence Party, who had previously been the prime minister in 2017 and who was the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs of the current government.\n\nOn 13 October, Benediktsson [announced](https://apnews.com/article/iceland-snap-election-coalition-government-9d170f37de3228506de93444668c416a) that the government had collapsed due to disputes over foreign policy, asylum seekers, and energy, prompting him to call for new elections and ask President Halla Tómasdóttir the next day to dissolve the Althingi and set the elections for 30 November.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the current information, it is highly unlikely that the new Prime Minister of Iceland will belong to the Left-Green Movement after the 2024 parliamentary elections. Here are some key points that support this assessment:\n\n## Current Popularity of the Left-Green Movement\nThe Left-Green Movement is currently experiencing significant declines in popularity. According to recent polls, the party's support has dropped to just 2.4%, which is one of the lowest levels among the major parties in Iceland[4].\n\n## Coalition Collapse and Political Climate\nThe coalition government, which included the Left-Green Movement, collapsed due to disagreements on various policy issues. This collapse and the subsequent call for snap elections in November indicate a lack of cohesion and vision within the coalition, further weakening the Left-Green Movement's position[3][5].\n\n## Leadership and Public Support\nSvandís Svavarsdóttir, the chairman of the Left-Green Movement, has stated that the party's MPs will not participate in the acting government, and the party is focusing on the upcoming elections. However, the party's support has not shown any significant signs of recovery since Svavarsdóttir took over[2][4].\n\n## Opposition and Other Parties' Popularity\nOther parties, particularly the Social Democratic Alliance, the Centre Party, and the Liberal Reform Party, are currently more popular and have higher levels of support. The Social Democratic Alliance, for example, has the most support with over 24%[4].\n\nGiven these factors, it is clear that the Left-Green Movement faces significant challenges in regaining enough support to lead the government after the 2024 parliamentary elections. Therefore, the likelihood of the new Prime Minister belonging to the Left-Green Movement is very low.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the coalition government in Iceland collapsed due to disputes over policy issues?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe coalition government in Iceland has collapsed due to disputes over policy issues, including economic policy, energy policy, immigration, and asylum seekers, as stated in multiple sources[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bjarni Benediktsson recently become Prime Minister of Iceland?\nANSWER: YES\n\nBjarni Benediktsson took office as the Prime Minister of Iceland on 9 April 2024, replacing Katrin Jakobsdottir who resigned to run for president[3][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Katrín Jakobsdóttir lose the 2024 Icelandic presidential election?\nANSWER: YES\n\nKatrín Jakobsdóttir did lose the 2024 Icelandic presidential election. She came in second with more than 25 percent of the vote, while Halla Tómasdóttir won the election with more than 34 percent of the votes[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Katrín Jakobsdóttir announced her intention to resign as Prime Minister to run for president?\nANSWER: YES\n\nKatrín Jakobsdóttir has announced her intention to resign as Prime Minister of Iceland in order to run for the position of President. This is confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Independence Party leading in recent opinion polls in Iceland?\nANSWER: NO\n\nRecent opinion polls in Iceland indicate that the Independence Party is not leading. According to the latest polls, the Independence Party is polling at around 14% or 18%, which is significantly lower than their previous standings and not enough to lead over other parties like the Social Democratic Alliance, which is currently polling at around 26%[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Left-Green Movement expected to lose seats in the 2024 parliamentary elections?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no definitive information that directly states whether the Left-Green Movement is expected to lose seats in the 2024 parliamentary elections. The sources provide information about the current political situation, the collapse of the government, and the upcoming election, but they do not include specific polling data or predictions regarding the Left-Green Movement's performance in the 2024 elections.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are other political parties in Iceland currently more popular than the Left-Green Movement?\nANSWER: Yes, other political parties in Iceland are currently more popular than the Left-Green Movement. According to the latest polls and reports:\n\n- The Left-Green Movement is polling at around 3-3.7% of the vote, which is below the 5% threshold needed to gain seats in the Althingi[2][3][5].\n- In contrast, several other parties are polling significantly higher, such as the Social Democratic Alliance at around 22-25%, the Liberal Reform Party at around 11-15%, and the Centre Party at around 15-17%[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Left-Green Movement's popularity declining according to recent polls?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the popularity and seat projections for the Left and Green movements in the context of the 2024 European Parliament elections can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- The Left group is predicted to increase their representation from 38 to 44 seats, indicating a gain rather than a decline[1].\n- The Greens/European Free Alliance (G/EFA) group, however, is forecasted to lose seats, falling from 71 to 61 seats, which suggests a decline in their popularity[1].\n\nTherefore, while the Left movement is expected to gain seats, the Green movement is predicted to lose seats.\n\n**YES**, for the Green movement, and **NO**, for the Left movement. However, since the question asks about the \"Left-Green Movement\" collectively, the answer would be more nuanced.\n\n**UNCLEAR**, as the Left and Green movements have different trends according to the predictions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it common for the Prime Minister of Iceland to come from the largest party in a coalition?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is often the case but not a strict rule that the Prime Minister of Iceland comes from the largest party in a coalition.\n\n- Historically, the Independence Party, which is often the largest party, has had its leaders hold the office of Prime Minister. However, this is not always the case, especially in coalition governments where other parties may hold significant influence[4|.\n- For example, after the 2021 parliamentary election, the Prime Minister was Katrín Jakobsdóttir from the Left-Green Movement, even though the Independence Party was part of the coalition and had a significant number of seats. It was only in April 2024 that Bjarni Benediktsson from the Independence Party replaced her as Prime Minister[3][5].\n\nTherefore, while it is common, it is not a guaranteed outcome that the Prime Minister will come from the largest party in a coalition.\n\n**YES**, but with exceptions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it unlikely that the Left-Green Movement will be part of the next governing coalition in Iceland?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears unlikely that the Left-Green Movement will be part of the next governing coalition in Iceland for several reasons:\n\n1. **Dissolution of the Current Coalition**: The current coalition government, which includes the Left-Green Movement, has been dissolved. Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson announced the end of the governing coalition on October 13, and elections are scheduled for November 30[2][5].\n\n2. **Policy Gridlock and Differences**: The coalition faced significant policy gridlock, particularly on issues such as immigration, alcohol laws, and energy policy, which contributed to the decision to dissolve the government[5].\n\n3. **Polling and Expected Losses**: Recent polls indicate that the Left-Green Movement is at risk of losing significant representation in parliament. The party is currently polling at 3%, which is below the 5% threshold required for representation in the Icelandic parliament[5].\n\nGiven these points, it is unlikely that the Left-Green Movement will be part of the next governing coalition.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 50 days remain until the resolution deadline of January 1, 2025. The parliamentary elections are scheduled for November 30, 2024, so the outcome is likely to be known within 1 to 2 months.\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:** The Left-Green Movement would not produce the next Prime Minister. Given their current low polling numbers, they may not secure enough seats to influence the formation of the next government.\n\n(c) **Forecast with a quarter of the time left:** If there were only about 12 days left, the probability of the Left-Green Movement leading the next government would be even lower, as there would be insufficient time for a significant shift in public opinion or political dynamics.\n\n(d) **Forecast with four times the time left:** With approximately 8 months remaining, there would be more time for the Left-Green Movement to potentially regain support. However, given current trends and their declining popularity, the probability would still be low, albeit slightly higher than at present.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Polling Data:** Recent polls indicate that the Left-Green Movement's support has declined significantly, hovering around 2.4%, which is below the 5% threshold required to secure seats in the Althingi (Icelandic parliament).\n\n- **Coalition Prospects:** The collapse of the previous coalition government and the Left-Green Movement's exclusion from the acting government suggest diminished influence. Other parties, such as the Social Democratic Alliance (polling around 24%), the Centre Party, and the Liberal Reform Party, are currently more popular and more likely to play significant roles in forming the next government.\n\n- **Leadership Changes:** Former Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir of the Left-Green Movement resigned to run for president and was succeeded by Bjarni Benediktsson of the Independence Party. The leadership transition indicates a shift in political power away from the Left-Green Movement.\n\n- **Historical Context:** While it's not unprecedented for smaller parties to secure the prime ministership in coalition governments, the Left-Green Movement's current low popularity makes this highly unlikely in the upcoming elections.\n\n- **Time Constraints:** With limited time before the elections, it is improbable that the Left-Green Movement can reverse its declining popularity and secure enough seats to negotiate the prime ministership in a coalition agreement.\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
