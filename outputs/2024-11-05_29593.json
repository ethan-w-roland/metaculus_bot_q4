    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill US airline passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 be up year over year, according to the TSA?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if total passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving, i.e., November 26 and November 27, 2024, exceed the equivalent Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving in 2023, which was November 21 and November 22, 2023. The resolution source is the TSA checkpoint travel numbers, which can be found at [this link](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes) for 2024. The archived 2023 TSA passenger volume numbers can be found [here](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes/2023).\n\nThe two days of November 21, 2023 and November 22, 2023, had respective passenger numbers of 2,647,461 and 2,741,610, for a total of 5,389,071. Therefore, this question resolves as **Yes** if total passenger volume for the period of November 21 and November 22, 2024, exceeds 5,389,071 and resolves as **No** if it is less than or equal to 5,389,071.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe question will resolve as soon as the data is posted and accessed by Metaculus Admins. However, if there are delays then resolution will wait up to the end of the quarter to be posted for the time in question. If it has not been posted as of January 7, 2025, when accessed by Admins, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe Thanksgiving season is one of the busiest times of the year for travel, and 2024 [is expected](https://www.crossroadstoday.com/lifestyle/the-busiest-travel-days-around-thanksgiving/article_1dc81c6f-58c2-543c-a858-ca738283d6f1.html) to break records..\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether US airline passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 will be up year over year, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Trends\n- The period around Thanksgiving is consistently one of the busiest times for air travel in the US. In recent years, passenger volumes have been increasing, often surpassing pre-pandemic levels. For example, in 2023, the TSA screened a record number of passengers during the Thanksgiving weekend, with Sunday after Thanksgiving being the busiest day.\n\n## Current Growth\n- Air travel demand has been strong and growing. In 2023, the TSA screened over 2.9 million passengers on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, a new record. This trend suggests that air travel is rebounding strongly from the pandemic, with passenger numbers consistently increasing.\n\n## Industry Preparations\n- Airlines have been preparing for high travel volumes by hiring aggressively, adjusting schedules, and investing in technology to improve passenger experience. This preparation indicates an expectation of continued high demand.\n\n## Projections\n- While specific projections for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 are not provided in the sources, the overall trend and industry preparations suggest that passenger volumes are likely to remain high or increase. Airlines for America anticipated a record number of travelers for the 2023 Thanksgiving period, and similar expectations could hold for 2024.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to infer that the passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 is likely to be up year over year, aligning with the broader trend of increasing air travel demand. However, without explicit year-over-year projections for these specific days, this conclusion is based on the general trends and industry expectations rather than a definitive statement from the TSA.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the TSA announced plans to increase staffing or capacity for handling more passengers in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the TSA has announced plans to increase staffing and capacity to handle more passengers in 2024.\n\n- The fiscal 2024 homeland security appropriations measure includes funding to support increased passenger volume. Specifically, the budget request includes $174 million in additional resources to support increased passenger volume for both FY 2024 and FY 2025 through increases in the screening workforce and other volume-dependent requirements.\n\n- The TSA has also reported hiring over 9,000 new Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) and Security Support Assistants in 2023, and there are ongoing efforts to maintain and improve staffing levels to handle increased passenger volumes.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the US economy projected to grow in 2024 according to current forecasts?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAll the sources provided indicate that the US economy is projected to grow in 2024, although the forecasts vary slightly in terms of the growth rate.\n\n- J.P. Morgan forecasts a 0.7% real GDP growth rate for 2024.\n- The Conference Board expects real GDP to expand by 2.5% in 2024.\n- EY forecasts real GDP growth averaging 2.7% in 2024.\n- Deloitte predicts real GDP to increase by 2.7% in 2024.\n\nEach of these sources confirms positive growth for the US economy in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are airlines planning to increase flight capacity for the Thanksgiving 2024 travel period?\nANSWER: YES, airlines are planning to increase flight capacity for the Thanksgiving 2024 travel period.\n\n- According to the data, airlines are preparing for a surge in passengers by increasing flight capacity. For example, there will be around 23,100 flights on November 26 alone, which is a record-breaking number.\n- Airlines have been hiring aggressively and adjusting their schedules to meet the high demand, with increased domestic seats available during the Thanksgiving week, a rise of 4.5 percent compared to the corresponding week in 2019 before the pandemic.\n- Alaska Airlines is also increasing its capacity, with mainline aircraft being used to boost capacity by up to 40% on certain routes.\n- Additionally, US airlines are boosting capacity to keep up with the immense demand during the holiday period.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence to suggest that health concerns like COVID-19 will significantly impact air travel in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication that health concerns like COVID-19 will significantly impact air travel in 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The airline industry is predicted to fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2024, with passenger traffic expected to reach or surpass 2019 levels.\n- The recovery is already underway, with total demand and capacity increasing significantly compared to previous years.\n- While there are still some regional variations and challenges, such as economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, the overall trend indicates a return to pre-pandemic levels of air travel.\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that the significant impact of COVID-19 on air travel is expected to be mitigated by 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is consumer confidence expected to remain strong in 2024?\nANSWER: The outlook for consumer confidence in 2024 is mixed and depends on various factors, so the answer is not straightforward.\n\n- The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index showed an increase in October 2024, marking a third consecutive month of rises, but it is still below historical averages.\n- The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index also rebounded in October 2024, recording the strongest monthly gain since March 2021, although it remains within a narrow range seen over the past two years.\n- Despite these improvements, there are ongoing concerns about inflation, job prospects, and the upcoming election, which could impact consumer confidence. For example, inflation expectations remain high, and consumers continue to express frustration over high prices.\n- Economic forecasts suggest that consumer spending is expected to rise, driven by growing income and the ability of households to take on more debt, but there are also risks such as geopolitical conflicts and persistent inflation that could affect consumer confidence.\n\nGiven these mixed signals, it is unclear whether consumer confidence will remain strong throughout 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any planned improvements or expansions in airport infrastructure scheduled for completion before November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several planned improvements and expansions in airport infrastructure, but the specific completion dates for these projects are not explicitly stated as being before November 2024.\n\n- Ontario International Airport is receiving $4 million for runway and taxiway rehabilitation projects, but the completion date is not specified.\n- Various airports are receiving grants under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) for different projects, including runway and taxiway reconstructions, but the sources do not provide specific completion dates for these projects.\n- The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024 outlines several reforms and funding increases for airport infrastructure, but it does not specify the completion dates for the projects funded under this act.\n\nGiven the lack of specific completion dates in the sources, the answer to whether these improvements are scheduled for completion before November 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous years shown an increase in passenger volumes during the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving compared to the prior year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence to suggest that passenger volumes during the Thanksgiving travel period, including the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving, have been increasing over the years, but the specific comparison to the prior year for these exact days is not explicitly detailed in every source.\n\nHowever, here are some key points:\n- The sources indicate a general increase in travel volumes for the entire Thanksgiving period. For example, Airlines for America projects a 9% increase in air travel from 2022 to 2023.\n- Specifically, the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving are historically the busiest days for air travel ahead of the holiday, and the sources suggest these days will continue to see high volumes in 2023.\n- The data provided shows an overall increase in passenger numbers for the week leading up to Thanksgiving in 2023 compared to 2022, which includes the Tuesday and Wednesday before the holiday.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to infer that previous years have shown an increase in passenger volumes during the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving, especially when considering the broader context of increasing travel demand.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are fuel prices expected to remain stable or decrease in 2024 compared to 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the consensus is that fuel prices are expected to decrease or remain stable but at lower levels in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\n- Experts from GasBuddy and the Oil Price Information Service predict that gas prices will follow a normal seasonal cycle in 2024, but with prices slightly lower than in 2023.\n- The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that average US retail fuel prices for gasoline will decline from $3.52 per gallon in 2023 to $3.36 per gallon in 2024 and to $3.24 per gallon in 2025. Similarly, diesel prices are expected to decrease from $4.21 per gallon in 2023 to $3.92 per gallon in 2024 and to $3.85 per gallon in 2025.\n\nTherefore, the expectation is for a decrease in fuel prices in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has US airline passenger volume shown a consistent year-over-year increase in the years leading up to 2023?\nANSWER: The data indicates that the recovery of US airline passenger volume has been progressive but not consistently increasing year-over-year in the immediate years leading up to 2023, especially when considering the impact of the pandemic.\n\n- In 2023, US airlines carried around 819.3 million passengers on domestic flights, which was an increase from the 750.6 million in the previous year.\n- However, the recovery was not linear. The industry was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and passenger numbers were lower in 2020 and 2021 compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n- By 2022, passenger numbers began to rise as COVID restrictions were lifted, and this trend continued into 2023. For example, the US domestic market was ahead of the 2019 tally for every month in 2023.\n\nTherefore, while there was a significant increase in passenger volume in 2023 compared to the previous years, the recovery was not consistent across all years leading up to 2023 due to the pandemic's impact.\n\n**YES**, but with the caveat that the increase was not consistent across all years due to pandemic disruptions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any significant disruptions to air travel been forecasted for 2024, such as strikes or geopolitical events?\nANSWER: Significant disruptions to air travel in 2024 have been forecasted or noted in several sources, although they do not specifically mention strikes. Here are some of the forecasted disruptions:\n\n## Air Traffic Controller Shortage\nThere is an anticipated shortage of air traffic controllers, which could lead to flight delays and disruptions. Despite increased hiring, the FAA is still about 3,000 controllers short, and this understaffing is expected to cause issues, particularly in areas like New York City and Florida.\n\n## Technological Outages\nA recent global tech outage caused by a flawed software update has resulted in significant flight cancellations and delays. This issue, though not a forecast but an ongoing problem, highlights the vulnerability of air travel to technological failures.\n\n## Economic Uncertainty and Global Events\nThe IATA has pointed out that global economic uncertainty, high interest rates, and potential escalations in armed conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could negatively impact airline revenues and passenger travel.\n\n## Weather and Climate Change\nForecasters predict a \"hyperactive Atlantic hurricane season\" with increased hurricane activity, which could disrupt flights, especially during the peak summer and hurricane seasons.\n\n## Staffing Issues\nStaffing problems, including a shortage of pilots and air traffic controllers, as well as funding issues for the FAA to modernize equipment, are expected to contribute to more delays, cancellations, and disruptions.\n\nWhile these are not specifically strikes or geopolitical events in the traditional sense, they do represent significant potential disruptions to air travel in 2024. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of November 5, 2024, there are approximately **21 days** until the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving (November 26 and November 27, 2024). The TSA typically publishes passenger volume data daily or shortly after, so the outcome should be known within **one month**.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends and projections hold steady with no significant disruptions, the passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 is expected to **increase** compared to 2023, resulting in the question resolving as **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **5 days** left until the dates in question, and assuming no major events have occurred, I would be more confident in forecasting an increase in passenger volume, potentially raising my probability estimate to around **85%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **12 weeks** remaining, there would be more uncertainty due to the extended time frame. Potential unforeseen events (e.g., economic shifts, geopolitical tensions) could occur, slightly reducing my confidence and lowering the probability estimate to around **75%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Historical Trends:**\n   - The Thanksgiving travel period has consistently seen high passenger volumes.\n   - In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing air travel demand, often surpassing pre-pandemic levels.\n   - Previous years have shown increases in passenger volumes during the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving.\n\n2. **Current Growth and Industry Preparations:**\n   - Airlines are **increasing capacity** for the Thanksgiving 2024 travel period.\n   - The TSA has announced plans to **increase staffing and capacity** to handle more passengers in 2024.\n   - Airlines have been **hiring aggressively**, adjusting schedules, and investing in technology.\n\n3. **Economic Outlook:**\n   - The US economy is projected to **grow in 2024**, with forecasts ranging from 0.7% to 2.7% real GDP growth.\n   - Economic growth typically correlates with increased consumer spending on travel.\n\n4. **Fuel Prices:**\n   - Fuel prices are expected to **remain stable or decrease** in 2024 compared to 2023.\n   - Lower fuel prices can lead to reduced airfare costs and encourage more people to travel.\n\n5. **Consumer Confidence:**\n   - Consumer confidence has shown signs of improvement, with increases in consumer sentiment indices.\n   - While mixed signals exist, there are positive indicators for consumer spending.\n\n6. **Potential Disruptions:**\n   - **Air Traffic Controller Shortages** and staffing issues may cause some delays but are not expected to significantly reduce passenger volumes.\n   - No significant **health concerns** (e.g., COVID-19) are expected to impact air travel in 2024.\n   - **Geopolitical events** and economic uncertainties pose risks but are not currently projected to disrupt Thanksgiving travel.\n\n7. **Infrastructure Improvements:**\n   - Ongoing airport infrastructure projects may enhance capacity and efficiency, although completion dates are unclear.\n\n8. **Base Rates and Patterns:**\n   - Given the consistent increase in passenger volumes during the holiday period, base rates favor an increase in 2024.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the strong historical trends, industry preparations, positive economic forecasts, and the lack of significant projected disruptions, it is reasonable to predict that the US airline passenger volume for the Tuesday and Wednesday before Thanksgiving 2024 will be **up year over year**.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 80%**",
