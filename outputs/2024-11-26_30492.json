    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore still be in space on December 30, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-26\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if both Sunita (Suni) Williams and Butch Wilmore are in space on December 30, 2024, at noon EST, based on credible sources. If they have returned to Earth's surface, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThis question will be annulled in the event of loss of life of either astronaut.\n\nThe question resolves unambiguously if both astronauts are alive at the relevant time, regardless of their physical or mental condition. \"Earth's surface\" is to be understood in opposition to space (above the Kármán line), orbit (aboard the ISS), or in transit aboard a surface-bound ship.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nCNET: [Stranded NASA Astronauts Are Eating Pizza, Shrimp Cocktail, Cereal With Powdered Milk](https://www.cnet.com/science/stranded-nasa-astronauts-are-eating-pizza-shrimp-cocktail-cereal-with-powdered-milk/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information provided, astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will indeed still be in space on December 30, 2024.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- They launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5, 2024, and have been living and working on the International Space Station since June 6, 2024[2][3].\n- Due to safety concerns and technical issues with the Starliner, NASA decided to return the Starliner spacecraft uncrewed and to have Williams and Wilmore return to Earth on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft as part of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission in February 2025[1][3].\n\nGiven that their return is scheduled for February 2025, it is clear that they will still be in space on December 30, 2024.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the SpaceX Crew-9 mission currently planned to land on Earth in February 2025?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe SpaceX Crew-9 mission is currently planned to land on Earth in February 2025, as indicated in multiple sources[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore scheduled to return to Earth on the SpaceX Crew-9 mission?\nANSWER: YES, Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are scheduled to return to Earth on the SpaceX Crew-9 mission. The mission includes two empty seats on the initial launch, which will be used to bring Williams and Wilmore back from the International Space Station in February 2025[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any news reports or official announcements indicating that Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore have returned to Earth's surface as of December 30, 2024?\nANSWER: No, there have been no news reports or official announcements indicating that Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore have returned to Earth's surface as of December 30, 2024. According to the sources, their return is scheduled for late February 2025 aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft as part of NASA’s SpaceX Crew-9 mission[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Boeing Starliner spacecraft uncrewed and successfully returned to Earth as planned?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe Boeing Starliner spacecraft returned to Earth uncrewed and successfully completed its landing as planned. The spacecraft landed at White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico on September 7, 2024, after undocking from the International Space Station. The reentry and descent were executed without issues, and the spacecraft landed safely under three parachutes and an airbag-cushioned landing[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the International Space Station operational and confirming the continued presence of Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore?\nANSWER: The International Space Station (ISS) is operational, but there is no confirmation of the continued presence of Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore on the station based on the provided sources.\n\n- The sources detail the current operations, recent activities, and the presence of various crews and expeditions on the ISS, but they do not mention Sunita Williams or Butch Wilmore as part of the current crew[1][2][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any technical issues reported with the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft intended for the Crew-9 mission?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are no specific technical issues reported with the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft itself for the Crew-9 mission. The issues mentioned are related to the Falcon 9 rocket's second stage:\n\n- The second stage experienced an \"off-nominal deorbit burn\" and landed in the ocean outside of the targeted area[1][2][3].\n- There are no reports of any technical problems with the Dragon spacecraft during the Crew-9 mission. The Dragon successfully docked with the International Space Station as planned[1][2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any recent NASA statements indicating a change in the return schedule for Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent NASA statements indicating a change in the return schedule for Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore.\n\nOriginally, they were scheduled to return on the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, but due to safety concerns, including helium leaks and issues with the spacecraft’s reaction control thrusters, NASA decided to return the Starliner spacecraft to Earth uncrewed. As a result, Williams and Wilmore will now return to Earth in February 2025 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft as part of the SpaceX Crew-9 mission[1][2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any announced delays to the SpaceX Crew-9 mission as of November 26, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been announced delays to the SpaceX Crew-9 mission.\n\n- The mission was originally scheduled to launch in mid-August 2024 but was delayed due to technical issues with the Boeing Starliner spacecraft[2][4].\n- It was then rescheduled for September 24, but this was further delayed to September 26 due to the need to work through prelaunch operations and monitor weather[3].\n- The launch was delayed again from September 26 to September 28 because of the expected impacts from Tropical Storm Helene, which was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane[1][2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore completed all their planned mission tasks on the International Space Station?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are still actively engaged in their mission on the International Space Station, despite the extended stay due to the issues with the Boeing Starliner.\n\n- The sources indicate that they are \"living and working aboard the space station as part of the Expedition 71/72 crew\" and are continuing to perform scientific work and other duties[1][3][4].\n- There is no mention that they have completed all their planned mission tasks, only that their mission has been extended and they are adapting to the new circumstances.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any health concerns reported for Sunita Williams or Butch Wilmore that might necessitate an earlier return?\nANSWER: There have been health concerns reported for Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore, but they do not necessarily necessitate an earlier return according to the latest updates.\n\n- Recent images of Sunita Williams showed significant weight loss and a gaunt appearance, which raised concerns about her health. However, Williams herself attributed the changes in her appearance to fluid shifts in the body due to the microgravity environment and a rigorous exercise regimen to maintain muscle and bone density[3][4][5].\n- Despite these concerns, NASA has maintained that both astronauts are closely monitored and are in good health. They undergo routine medical evaluations and have dedicated flight surgeons monitoring them[2][3][5].\n- The primary health issues mentioned are related to the extended stay in space, including muscle and bone loss, potential nutritional deficiencies, and the physical effects of living in a microgravity environment. However, these are being managed through continuous monitoring and support from NASA's medical team[1][2][4].\n\nTherefore, while there are health concerns, they are being managed, and there is no indication that an earlier return is necessary based on the current information. \n\n**UNCLEAR** (as to whether it necessitates an earlier return, but health concerns are acknowledged)",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately **34 days** remain until December 30, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  \nIf all current plans proceed without any alterations, both Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore will **still be in space** on December 30, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about **8.5 days** remaining until December 30, 2024, the likelihood of an unplanned return increases slightly. However, given that their return is scheduled for February 2025, even with reduced time, it is **highly probable** they would remain in space on the specified date.  \n**Forecast Probability:** **90%**\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith **136 days** remaining until December 30, 2024, there would be more time for unforeseen events to disrupt their mission. Potential factors such as mission delays, health issues, or technical problems could influence their stay. However, since the return is scheduled for February 2025, even with extended time, it is still **very likely** they would remain in space on December 30, 2024.  \n**Forecast Probability:** **95%**\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**  \nSunita Williams and Butch Wilmore launched on June 5, 2024, and are scheduled to return to Earth in February 2025 aboard the SpaceX Crew-9 mission. As of November 26, 2024, there are approximately 34 days until the resolution date of December 30, 2024. Current plans indicate no changes to their return schedule, and despite minor delays, the mission remains on track.\n\nHealth concerns have been reported but are being managed by NASA's medical team, reducing the likelihood of an unscheduled return. Additionally, the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft intended for their return has not reported technical issues that would necessitate an earlier landing.\n\nConsidering the time frame and the absence of significant disruptions, the probability that both astronauts will still be in space on December 30, 2024, is **very high**. Even when adjusting for scenarios with less or more time, the likelihood remains strong due to the established mission schedule.\n\n**Probability:** **95%**",
