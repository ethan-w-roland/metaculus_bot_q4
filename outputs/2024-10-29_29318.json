    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nIn the 2024 US elections, will Republicans win both the White House and the House of Representatives?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Republican Party wins control of the House of Representives and if the individual who wins the presidential election is the nominee of the Republican Party in the 2024 US elections.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections. In case of any confusion or ambiguity about which party wins the House, the deciding factor will be which party has a majority of the votes required to elect the Speaker of the House.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe 2024 US elections will be held on November 5, 2024. See Wikipedia: [2024 United States elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_elections)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Republicans winning both the White House and the House of Representatives in the 2024 US elections, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## House of Representatives\n- As of October 2024, Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the U.S. House with three vacancies. To maintain control, they need to retain their current seats and not lose more than a net of four districts, given the total of 435 seats up for election.\n- There are 54 districts identified as battleground races, with Democrats holding 29 and Republicans holding 25 of these. The outcome in these districts will be crucial in determining the majority.\n- Various forecasters and analysts have provided ratings and predictions, but the consensus is that the election is expected to be highly competitive, with forecasts suggesting less than a 5-seat difference between the two parties.\n\n## White House (Presidential Election)\n- The presidential election is a separate contest from the House of Representatives elections. The outcome of the presidential election is influenced by a wide range of factors, including national issues, candidate popularity, and electoral college dynamics.\n- As of the current date, there is no definitive prediction on who will win the presidential election, as it depends on various factors such as campaign performance, voter turnout, and external events.\n\n## Historical Context and Base Rates\n- Historically, it is rare for a party to lose control of the House after a single congressional term. The last time this happened was in 1954.\n- The presidential election and House elections can have different outcomes; it is possible for one party to win the presidency while the other party retains or gains control of the House.\n\n## Current State\n- The current political climate, including approval ratings and recent political events, could influence voter decisions. The 118th Congress has been marked by significant events and a low approval rating, which might impact voter sentiment.\n\nGiven these points, while it is possible for Republicans to win both the White House and the House of Representatives, the outcome is far from certain. The competitive nature of both the presidential and House elections means that multiple scenarios are plausible, and the final result will depend on a variety of factors that will unfold closer to the election date.\n\n### Can the question be clearly answered as yes or no?\nNo, the question cannot be clearly answered as yes or no based on the current information. The outcomes of both the presidential and House of Representatives elections are subject to various uncertainties and will be determined by a complex interplay of factors.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Republican presidential nominee leading in national polls as of October 29, 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nAs of October 29, 2024, the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, is slightly ahead in the national polls, not the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. According to the sources, Harris has a 1.4 percentage point lead in the national polls.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the incumbent president's approval rating fallen below 45% as of October 29, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about the incumbent president's approval rating as of October 29, 2024. The sources discuss various aspects of the 2024 presidential election, including polling data for candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, but they do not provide the current approval rating of the incumbent president, Joe Biden.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major scandals emerged involving the Democratic presidential nominee close to the election date?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any major scandals involving the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, close to the election date. The sources discuss various controversies and challenges, but they are primarily related to the Republican candidates or other figures, such as Mark Robinson, rather than Kamala Harris herself.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout among key Republican demographics projected to be higher than usual in the 2024 elections?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is some insight into voter turnout trends, particularly among certain demographics.\n\nFrom the NPR article, it is mentioned that Trump has successfully mobilized white non-college voters at higher rates, achieving a turnout of 64% in 2020. For the 2024 election, it is projected that \"white voters without degrees represent 26% of the eligible voter base but are expected to make up 32% of actual voters in 2024\".\n\nThis indicates that, despite overall turnout potentially decreasing due to reduced access to mail-in voting, the turnout among white non-college voters, a key Republican demographic, is still expected to be significant and possibly higher than their proportion of the eligible voter base.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are key swing states trending in favor of the Republican presidential nominee according to recent polls?\nANSWER: Based on the recent polls and analysis provided in the sources, the trend in key swing states is highly competitive and not definitively in favor of either candidate.\n\n- In some swing states, Trump has a marginal advantage, such as in Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia, although these leads are within the polling margin of error.\n- In other swing states, Harris is slightly ahead, such as in Michigan and Wisconsin, again with margins that are very narrow and within the polling margin of error.\n\nGiven that all these states are essentially toss-ups with margins less than 2 percentage points, it is unclear to say that the key swing states are trending definitively in favor of the Republican nominee.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Republicans projected to win a majority in the House of Representatives according to major forecasts?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the projections for the House of Representatives are mixed and do not uniformly favor the Republicans.\n\n- The Race to the WH forecast suggests that Democrats have a chance to win the majority, noting that Democrats need a net gain of four seats to achieve control, and they identify several competitive districts where this could happen.\n- YouGov's model indicates that Democrats are more likely than not to control the House, with Democrats winning a majority of seats in 57% of the simulations.\n- The BGOV insights mention that Democrats need a net gain of four seats to win a majority and highlight several battleground districts, but do not provide a clear projection favoring the Republicans.\n\nGiven these varied projections, it is not clear that Republicans are uniformly projected to win a majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have key endorsements from influential figures or organizations been made in favor of the Republican candidates?\nANSWER: Yes, key endorsements from influential figures and organizations have been made in favor of the Republican candidates, particularly Donald Trump, in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n- Several Republican senators, including Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas), have endorsed Donald Trump.\n- numerous House Republicans, such as Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), have also endorsed Trump.\n- Multiple Republican governors, including Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) and Gov. Greg Abbott (R-Texas), have pledged their support to Trump.\n- Other notable endorsements include those from former and current party leaders, and various state executives.\n\nThese endorsements indicate significant support from within the Republican Party for Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Republican Party won both the presidency and the House of Representatives simultaneously in recent elections?\nANSWER: To determine if the Republican Party has won both the presidency and the House of Representatives simultaneously in recent elections, we need to look at the outcomes of the last few presidential and congressional elections.\n\n### Presidency\n- In the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden, a Democrat, won the presidency.\n- In the 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump, a Republican, won the presidency.\n\n### House of Representatives\n- During Donald Trump's presidency (2017-2021), the House of Representatives was controlled by the Democrats for part of his term (2019-2021) and by the Republicans for the other part (2017-2019).\n- In the 2020 elections, the Democrats retained control of the House of Representatives, although with a reduced majority.\n- In the 2022 midterm elections, the Republicans gained control of the House of Representatives, which they currently hold as of the 118th Congress (2023-2025).\n\n### Simultaneous Control\n- The last time the Republican Party had simultaneous control of both the presidency and the House of Representatives was during the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency (2017-2019), when Republicans controlled both the House and the White House.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Republican Party united behind its presidential nominee without significant internal divisions?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it appears that the Republican Party has demonstrated a significant level of unity behind its presidential nominee, Donald Trump, particularly during the 2024 Republican National Convention.\n\n- The convention was described as one of the most unified in nearly a half-century, with delegates expressing a high level of unanimity and motivation to support Trump's nomination.\n- Key factors contributing to this unity include Trump's command of the GOP, the failed attempt to assassinate him, and his efforts to bring primary rivals like Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley to endorse him.\n- Trump’s acceptance speech also emphasized national unity, although it did revert to divisive rhetoric at times.\n- Surveys and delegate feedback indicate that a majority of Republicans see their party as very or somewhat united, with 63% of Republicans stating that their party is currently united.\n\nWhile there may be some underlying tensions or historical divisions within the party, the current context suggests a strong show of unity behind Trump's candidacy.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent economic indicators shown a downturn that could influence voter sentiment against the incumbent party?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are several indicators that suggest some economic challenges, but whether these are significant enough to influence voter sentiment against the incumbent party is not explicitly stated. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **GDP Growth and Inflation**: The US economy has shown a rebound in GDP growth, with a 3.0% growth rate in the second quarter of 2024, and inflation is expected to continue decreasing, which are generally positive signs.\n\n2. **Unemployment Rate**: The unemployment rate has risen to its highest level since October 2021, but it is still relatively low at 4.3%. The rise triggered the Sahm Recession Indicator, but economists do not see this as a cause for immediate concern, and employment is expected to continue rising, albeit at a slower pace.\n\n3. **Leading Economic Index (LEI)**: The LEI has been declining, which signals headwinds to economic growth. This decline is driven by factors such as new orders, interest rate spread, and consumer expectations. However, the rate of decline has moderated, and the Fed's anticipated interest rate cuts are expected to support economic activity in 2025.\n\n4. **Consumer Spending and Confidence**: Consumer spending remains a strong indicator, with households expected to continue spending, supported by lower interest rates and elevated government consumption.\n\nWhile these indicators show some economic challenges, such as a rising unemployment rate and a declining LEI, they do not necessarily indicate a severe economic downturn. The overall outlook remains relatively positive, with expectations of continued economic growth, albeit at a slower pace.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether recent economic indicators have shown a downturn that could influence voter sentiment against the incumbent party is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\nThe data suggests some economic headwinds but does not provide clear evidence that these are severe enough to significantly influence voter sentiment.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\n- The election is on November 5, 2024.\n- Today's date is October 29, 2024.\n- **Time left until the outcome is known: 7 days.**\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\n- **Presidential Election:** As of now, the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, is slightly ahead in national polls by 1.4 percentage points. Key swing states are highly competitive with margins within the polling error. If nothing changes, it's slightly more likely that Harris would win the presidency.\n  \n- **House of Representatives:** Republicans hold a narrow majority (220-212 with three vacancies). Democrats need a net gain of four seats to take control. Forecasts and models suggest a highly competitive race with no clear favorite. If nothing changes, control of the House is uncertain but could potentially shift to Democrats.\n\n- **Conclusion:** If nothing changes, it is less likely that Republicans will win both the White House and the House of Representatives.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approx. 2 days):**\n\n- With only two days left, current polling and trends become more reliable predictors.\n- **Forecast:** Slightly increased confidence in the current assessment—probability that Republicans win both decreases marginally due to reduced time for any significant shifts.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left (approx. 28 days):**\n\n- With 28 days left, there is more time for events that could influence voter sentiment (e.g., debates, scandals, economic changes).\n- **Forecast:** Increased uncertainty—probability that Republicans win both increases slightly to account for potential shifts in the political landscape.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Historical Context and Base Rates:**\n   - It is uncommon for the same party to win the presidency three times in a row. The Democrats have held the presidency for two terms under Obama and one term under Biden.\n   - Historically, midterm elections often favor the party not in the White House, but presidential election years can differ.\n\n2. **Presidential Race Analysis:**\n   - **Polling Data:** Kamala Harris leads national polls by 1.4 percentage points.\n   - **Swing States:** Key swing states are highly competitive, with margins within polling errors, making the Electoral College outcome uncertain.\n   - **Approval Ratings:** No clear data on the incumbent president's approval rating, adding uncertainty.\n\n3. **House of Representatives Analysis:**\n   - **Current Majority:** Republicans have a slim majority (220-212).\n   - **Battleground Districts:** 54 competitive districts could swing the majority.\n   - **Forecasts:** Mixed projections, some favoring Democrats to gain control.\n\n4. **Voter Turnout:**\n   - **Republican Turnout:** Expected to be strong among key demographics (white non-college voters).\n   - **Democratic Turnout:** Uncertain; turnout efforts and voter mobilization could impact results.\n\n5. **Party Unity and Endorsements:**\n   - **Republicans:** Displaying significant unity behind Donald Trump, which could enhance voter mobilization.\n   - **Endorsements:** High-profile endorsements may bolster Republican campaigns.\n\n6. **Economic Indicators:**\n   - **Mixed Signals:** Some economic challenges but not a significant downturn; unlikely to heavily sway voters against the incumbent party.\n\n7. **External Factors:**\n   - **Scandals:** No major scandals involving the Democratic nominee.\n   - **Events:** Potential for unforeseen events remains but is diminishing as the election approaches.\n\n8. **Conclusion:**\n   - Combining these factors, while Republicans have strengths (e.g., voter turnout, party unity), current polling and projections slightly favor Democrats in both the presidential race and possibly the House.\n   - The probability of Republicans winning **both** the presidency and the House is moderate but less than 50%.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
