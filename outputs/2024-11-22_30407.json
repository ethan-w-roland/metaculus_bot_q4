    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Bluesky reach 30 million users before 1 January 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, at any point before 1 January 2025, Bluesky reports at least 30 million users according to [this counter](https://bsky.jazco.dev/stats).\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf the counter stops reporting this number or there is reason to believe that the number reported is inaccurate, admins may resolve the question based on credible sources.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Bluesky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluesky) is a decentralised social media platform developed by Twitter co-founder [Jack Dorsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey). It aims to provide users with greater control over their data and the algorithms that curate their feeds. Since its public launch in February 2024, Bluesky has seen significant growth, going from 3 million users before launch to 20 million as of November 19, 2024, 10 million of which joined the platform over the past [two months](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/11/18/post-election-x-rival-bluesky-is-adding-millions-of-users/).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Bluesky reaching 30 million users before January 1, 2025, here are some key points and relevant background information:\n\n## Current User Base\nAs of November 22, 2024, Bluesky has already surpassed 21 million users, with some sources indicating the number is over 21 million[4] and others slightly higher at 20.7 million[2].\n\n## Growth Rate\nBluesky has been experiencing rapid growth, particularly post-US election. It added 700,000 new users in a single week in November[1], and its user base surged from approximately 13 million at the end of October to 15 million by November 14, and then to over 21 million by November 22[3][4].\n\n## Time to Resolution\nThe question will resolve on January 1, 2025, which gives Bluesky about 40 days to reach the 30 million user mark from its current level.\n\n## Base Rates and Trends\nGiven the recent acceleration in user growth, especially following significant events like the US presidential election, it is clear that Bluesky is gaining traction quickly. However, predicting user growth can be volatile and influenced by various factors such as user engagement, platform updates, and external events.\n\n## Reference Classes\nWhile there are no direct reference classes for Bluesky's specific growth trajectory, the rapid adoption rates seen in other social media platforms during their early stages can provide some context. However, each platform's growth is unique and influenced by different factors.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the current growth rate and the time remaining until January 1, 2025, it is plausible that Bluesky could reach 30 million users. However, the answer is not immediately clear and depends on maintaining or increasing the current growth rate.\n\nFor a superforecaster, key considerations would include:\n- The sustainability of the current growth rate.\n- Any potential external factors that could influence user adoption (e.g., platform updates, marketing campaigns, or significant events).\n- Historical growth patterns of similar social media platforms, though with the understanding that each case is unique.\n\nGiven the rapid growth and the relatively short time frame, the question cannot be definitively answered as yes or no without further data or predictive modeling.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Bluesky expanding into new geographic markets in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that Bluesky is expanding into new geographic markets in December 2024. The sources discuss the platform's growth, user base, and features, but they do not mention any plans for geographic expansion in December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there no significant technical issues or outages reported on Bluesky in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information about the technical issues or outages on Bluesky specifically for December 2024. The sources discuss issues and outages that occurred in November 2024, but they do not provide any information about December.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Bluesky planning any major marketing campaigns in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that Bluesky is planning any major marketing campaigns in December 2024. The sources discuss the platform's current state, user growth, and potential future developments, but they do not mention any specific marketing campaigns planned for December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bluesky secured partnerships with major companies or influencers to promote the platform in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about Bluesky securing new partnerships with major companies or influencers in December 2024. However, it is mentioned that Bluesky has existing partnerships with companies such as Buffer and Namecheap to expand its integration capabilities, but these partnerships were noted in the context of updates prior to December 2024[1][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Bluesky secured new partnerships in December 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Bluesky have a current user base of at least 21 million users as of November 22, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, as of November 22, 2024, Bluesky's user base is slightly above 20 million but not yet at 21 million.\n\n- One source mentions that Bluesky reached 20 million users in November 2024 and has continued to grow, with over 20.7 million users as of November 22[3].\n- Another source confirms the 20 million user milestone and notes the ongoing growth but does not specify a number above 20 million as of the same date[2].\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bluesky been adding at least 700,000 new users per week since November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Bluesky has been experiencing significant growth, particularly around the time of the US presidential election in November 2024.\n\n- Bluesky added more than 1 million new members in the week following the US presidential election, bringing its total to almost 15 million users[1].\n- Since the election, Bluesky has been adding over 1 million users a day for several days, which translates to more than 7 million users per week[2].\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that Bluesky has been adding more than 700,000 new users per week, and in fact, the numbers are significantly higher than that.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Bluesky maintaining a high user retention rate that supports continued growth through December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no direct data or analysis specifically addressing the user retention rate of Bluesky through December 2024. The sources provide information on the rapid growth in user numbers, especially following the US presidential election, and the increasing engagement on the platform. However, they do not offer detailed insights into user retention rates.\n\nFor example, sources [2], [3], and [4] discuss the significant increase in user numbers and engagement but do not provide metrics on how many of these new users are retained over time.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Bluesky is maintaining a high user retention rate that supports continued growth through December 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Bluesky's user growth rate expected to remain steady or increase in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether Bluesky's user growth rate is expected to remain steady or increase in December 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources provide detailed information about Bluesky's rapid growth in recent months, particularly in November 2024, driven by various factors such as user dissatisfaction with X (formerly Twitter) and significant events like the US presidential election[1][2][3].\n- However, none of the sources provide specific projections or expectations for the user growth rate in December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Bluesky introducing new features or updates that could attract additional users before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, Bluesky is introducing new features and updates that could attract additional users before January 1, 2025.\n\nSeveral upcoming features and improvements have been outlined, including:\n- The introduction of direct messages (DMs), which have already been shipped but will see further development[1][2].\n- The addition of video integration, allowing users to share 90-second video clips[1].\n- Improvements to Custom Feeds, such as in-app feed creation, better feed discovery, and new feedback mechanisms[1].\n- The implementation of OAuth for easier and safer sign-in options for third-party clients[1].\n- Enhanced anti-harassment features and other quality of life improvements[1].\n\nThese updates are planned to be rolled out over the next few months, which would be before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the overall trend in social media platform growth rates supportive of Bluesky reaching 30 million users?\nANSWER: The information provided does not specifically address the growth potential or user base of Bluesky, nor does it offer any data or insights about Bluesky's performance or trends.\n\nGiven that the sources discuss various popular social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter (now X), TikTok, and others, but do not mention Bluesky, the answer to whether the overall trend in social media platform growth rates is supportive of Bluesky reaching 30 million users is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n\n40 days (from November 22, 2024, to January 1, 2025)\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n\nIf nothing changes and Bluesky continues its current trajectory without any acceleration or deceleration in user growth, it would likely not reach the 30 million user mark by January 1, 2025. Based on the current user base of approximately 21 million and assuming a consistent growth rate of around 700,000 new users per week, Bluesky would reach approximately 24.8 million users in 40 days. This falls short of the 30 million target.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n\nWith only 10 days remaining, the window for additional user growth is significantly reduced. Maintaining the current growth rate of approximately 700,000 new users per week translates to about 100,000 new users in 10 days. Starting from 21 million, this would bring the total to around 21.1 million, making it highly unlikely to reach 30 million users within such a short period.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n\nWith 160 days (approximately 5 months) to reach the target, Bluesky would have a much more feasible timeframe to achieve 30 million users. At a sustained growth rate of 700,000 new users per week, Bluesky could potentially add around 45.6 million users over 160 days, surpassing the 30 million mark comfortably. This extended timeframe allows for fluctuations in growth rates, marketing efforts, and potential viral adoption patterns that could drive user acquisition beyond current estimates.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nTo assess the probability of Bluesky reaching 30 million users by January 1, 2025, we consider the current user base, growth rate, and the limited time frame. As of November 22, 2024, Bluesky has approximately 21 million users. To achieve 30 million users in 40 days, Bluesky would need to add 9 million users, averaging around 225,000 new users per day. \n\nGiven that recent growth figures indicate around 700,000 new users per week (~100,000 per day), the target is significantly higher than the current trajectory. Even with optimistic projections, sustaining this accelerated growth rate is challenging due to market saturation, potential technical limitations, and the inherent unpredictability of viral user adoption.\n\nMoreover, sub-questions reveal uncertainties regarding Bluesky's expansion into new markets, technical stability, marketing campaigns, and partnerships—all factors that could influence user growth but currently remain unclear. Without concrete plans or data indicating an impending surge in user acquisition, it's prudent to assign a lower probability to reaching the 30 million milestone within the given timeframe.\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
