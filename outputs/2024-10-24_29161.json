{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nOn October 31, 2024, will VoteHub's Early Voting Tracker show Democrats having 2/3rd or higher of the mail and absentee ballots returned in Pennsylvania?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-24\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to the VoteHub Project's Early Voting Tracker, which can be accessed [here](https://projects.votehub.us/pages/early-voting-tracker), with the page for Pennsylvania selected, at least 66.7% of the ballot returns shown in the state were from voters registered as Democrats, when the page is accessed by Metaculus on or after October 31, 2024. If it the number does not meet that threshold, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. In case of the resolution source being down, Metaculus Admins will wait until November 4, 2024, at which point this question will be annulled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nVoteHub [describes itself](https://about.votehub.us/) as \"an election media organization that aims to provide top-notch, innovative coverage in three key areas: election reporting at a detailed level and in real time, public opinion survey aggregations, and analysis on election results and trends. We are nonpartisan and independent.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Democrats having 2/3rd or higher of the mail and absentee ballots returned in Pennsylvania on October 31, 2024, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Historical Context\nIn the 2020 general election, Democrats had a significant lead in mail ballot requests and returns. For example, in Pennsylvania, Democrats requested 25.5% of the mail ballots, while Republicans requested 12.2%.\n\n## Current Trends\nAs of the latest updates, Democrats are still leading in absentee ballot requests in many states, including Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, as of recent data, Democrats have requested 25% of the absentee ballots, compared to 12% for Republicans.\n\n## Party Registration and Voting Behavior\nHistorically, Democrats have been more likely to vote by mail than Republicans. In the 2020 election, about 60% of Democrats and 32% of Republicans voted by mail.\n\n## State-Specific Data\nWhile the exact numbers for October 31, 2024, are not yet available, the trend suggests that Democrats are likely to maintain a significant lead in mail and absentee ballot returns. However, whether this lead will be 2/3rd or higher is uncertain and would depend on the specific data available closer to the date.\n\n## Legislative Changes\nSome states, including swing states like Georgia and North Carolina, have implemented new laws that could affect early voting and absentee ballot processes. However, Pennsylvania's specific regulations and their impact on the current early voting numbers are not detailed in the provided sources.\n\nGiven these points, while it is plausible that Democrats could have a significant majority of the mail and absentee ballots returned, it is not clear whether this will exceed 2/3rd without the most up-to-date and specific data for Pennsylvania as of October 31, 2024.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historical data from 2020 shows a strong preference for mail voting among Democrats.\n- Current trends indicate continued higher rates of mail ballot requests by Democrats.\n\n### Time to Resolution\nThe answer will become clearer as more data is collected and reported in the coming days leading up to October 31, 2024.\n\n### Current State of the World\nChanges in voting laws and voter behavior post-2020 could influence the outcome, but the general trend of higher Democratic participation in mail voting is consistent.\n\nIn summary, while the historical and current trends suggest Democrats are likely to have a significant lead in mail and absentee ballot returns, the exact percentage as of October 31, 2024, cannot be definitively determined from the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the overall number of mail and absentee ballots returned in Pennsylvania decreased in 2024 compared to previous elections?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or comparison given to determine whether the overall number of mail and absentee ballots returned in Pennsylvania has decreased in 2024 compared to previous elections. The sources provide information on the process, deadlines, and rules for mail and absentee voting but do not include comparative data on the number of ballots returned in different election years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current trends indicating that Democratic voters in Pennsylvania prefer mail and absentee voting more than Republican voters in 2024?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not contain specific data or trends regarding the preferences of Democratic versus Republican voters in Pennsylvania for mail and absentee voting in the 2024 general election. The information given is general and applies to all registered voters in Pennsylvania, without differentiation by party affiliation.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether current trends indicate that Democratic voters in Pennsylvania prefer mail and absentee voting more than Republican voters in 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the percentage of Democratic mail and absentee ballot returns in Pennsylvania trending towards 66.7% as of the latest available data?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not include any data or statistics regarding the percentage of Democratic mail and absentee ballot returns in Pennsylvania. They focus on the procedures, deadlines, and requirements for voting by mail or absentee ballot, but do not provide specific data on the returns or trends related to any particular party.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it currently reported that Democrats have requested more mail and absentee ballots than Republicans in Pennsylvania for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: YES, it is currently reported that Democrats have requested more mail and absentee ballots than Republicans in Pennsylvania for the 2024 election. According to data from the Secretary of State, Democrats in Pennsylvania have significantly outpaced Republicans in securing mail-in ballots, with over 878,000 Democratic voters signing up for mail-in voting compared to only 371,000 Republicans.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has VoteHub's Early Voting Tracker shown consistent data reporting for Pennsylvania's mail and absentee ballot returns in previous weeks?\nANSWER: The query mentions \"VoteHub's Early Voting Tracker,\" but the provided sources do not reference VoteHub or its Early Voting Tracker. The sources discuss ballot tracking and early voting statistics from other sources, such as the Pennsylvania Department of State and specific county election offices, but they do not provide information about VoteHub's tracking consistency.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether VoteHub's Early Voting Tracker has shown consistent data reporting for Pennsylvania's mail and absentee ballot returns is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Pennsylvania's Democratic Party efforts encouraging mail and absentee voting more than the Republican Party in 2024?\nANSWER: The information provided does not compare the efforts of the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in encouraging mail and absentee voting in Pennsylvania for the 2024 election. The sources detail the general procedures, deadlines, and requirements for mail-in and absentee voting in Pennsylvania, but they do not provide a comparison of the promotional or encouragement efforts of the two parties.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Pennsylvania's Democratic Party efforts are encouraging mail and absentee voting more than the Republican Party in 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Democrats historically made up at least 66.7% of mail and absentee ballot returns in Pennsylvania by October 31 in previous general elections?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or historical context that directly addresses the percentage of mail and absentee ballot returns by Democrats in Pennsylvania by October 31 in previous general elections.\n\nWhile the sources provide information on the process of voting by mail and absentee ballots in Pennsylvania, as well as some general trends in early voting nationally and in other states, they do not provide the specific historical data needed to determine if Democrats have historically made up at least 66.7% of mail and absentee ballot returns in Pennsylvania by October 31.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter enthusiasm among Pennsylvania Democrats in 2024 at levels comparable to or higher than in the 2020 election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether voter enthusiasm among Pennsylvania Democrats in 2024 is at levels comparable to or higher than in the 2020 election.\n\nWhile the sources indicate that Democrats in Pennsylvania have seen some increases in voter registration since Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, they also highlight several challenges and trends that suggest overall enthusiasm might not be as high as in 2020:\n\n- Democrats are experiencing their weakest voter registration advantage in recent decades, with a decline in their overall share of registered voters.\n- There has been a significant rise in voters leaving the Democratic Party, with a 103% increase in Democrats switching to other parties compared to the previous year.\n- Low turnout in Philadelphia, a crucial area for Democratic votes, has been a concern in both the 2020 and 2022 elections, and this trend continues to be a worry.\n- Experts like Lara Putnam note that voter registration is an imperfect measure of political engagement and that current registration losses are partly due to historical factors rather than current enthusiasm.\n\nThese points suggest that while there are some positive trends, the overall enthusiasm and engagement among Pennsylvania Democrats may not be as strong as in the 2020 election.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any changes been made to Pennsylvania's voting laws since 2020 that could affect mail and absentee voting patterns?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been changes to Pennsylvania's voting laws since 2020 that could affect mail and absentee voting patterns.\n\n1. **Date Requirement on Mail Ballot Return Envelopes**: A federal appeals court decision in 2024 upheld a Pennsylvania law requiring mail voters to handwrite a date on the return envelope. This ruling could lead to the rejection of ballots that lack a date or are misdated, potentially affecting the number of mail ballots counted.\n\n2. **Conflicts Within the Election Code**: Act 77, signed in 2019, introduced significant changes, but it has also created conflicts with older portions of the Election Code. For example, there is a discrepancy regarding whether a voter who has returned a mail ballot can also cast a provisional ballot, which has led to legal challenges and varying interpretations by counties.\n\n3. **Centralized Counting of Absentee and Mail-in Ballots**: Act 77 mandated that absentee and mail-in ballots must be counted centrally at the county board of elections office, rather than at polling places. This change affects the logistics and timing of ballot counting.\n\nThese changes indicate that there have been notable adjustments to the rules governing mail and absentee voting in Pennsylvania since 2020.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant events or factors in 2024 that might discourage Democratic voters from using mail and absentee ballots in Pennsylvania?\nANSWER: While there are several factors and ongoing issues related to mail-in and absentee ballots in Pennsylvania, here are some that could potentially discourage Democratic voters or create confusion and hurdles:\n\n## Legal Challenges and Rejection Rules\n- There have been ongoing legal battles regarding the counting of mail-in ballots, particularly those with missing or incorrect dates on the outer return envelopes. Although the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruled that such ballots should be counted, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court later overturned this decision, which could lead to confusion and potential disenfranchisement.\n\n## Procedural Complexities\n- The requirement for using two envelopes (an inner secrecy envelope and an outer envelope) and the need to include a handwritten date and signature on the outer envelope can be confusing for voters. Despite efforts to redesign the envelopes to clarify these steps, mistakes can still lead to ballot rejections.\n\n## Provisional Ballot Issues\n- Voters whose mail-in ballots are rejected may need to cast provisional ballots, but there is ongoing litigation about whether these provisional ballots should be counted, especially in cases where the original mail-in ballot was rejected due to technical errors.\n\n## Precanvassing Restrictions\n- Pennsylvania's rules prohibiting precanvassing of mail ballots until 7 a.m. on Election Day can lead to delays in counting and reporting results, which might create uncertainty and distrust in the voting process.\n\nThese factors, particularly the legal uncertainties and the potential for ballot rejections due to technical errors, could discourage some voters from using mail-in and absentee ballots in Pennsylvania.", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nThere are **7 days** remaining until October 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends persist and nothing significant changes, Democrats would have **at least 66.7%** of the mail and absentee ballots returned in Pennsylvania as reported by VoteHub's Early Voting Tracker on October 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **2 days** left, I would forecast a probability of **90%** that Democrats will have 66.7% or higher of the mail and absentee ballots returned.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith **28 days** remaining, I would forecast a probability of **75%**, accounting for the increased time for potential changes in voter behavior or unforeseen events.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Trends:** In the 2020 general election, Democrats in Pennsylvania had a significant lead in mail ballot requests and returns. They requested approximately 25% of the mail ballots compared to 12% for Republicans. The trend showed that about 60% of Democrats voted by mail versus 32% of Republicans.\n\n- **Current Data:** As of now, Democrats have requested over **878,000** mail-in ballots, while Republicans have requested around **371,000**. This means Democrats account for approximately **70%** of the mail ballot requests. Although requests do not always translate directly to returns, they are a strong indicator of potential returns.\n\n- **Voter Behavior:** Democrats have consistently shown a preference for mail and absentee voting. This trend has persisted into 2024, with Democratic voters continuing to utilize mail-in voting more than Republican voters.\n\n- **Time Frame:** With only 7 days left until October 31, there is limited time for significant shifts in the proportions of returned ballots. The lead that Democrats currently have in mail ballot requests is substantial and unlikely to be overcome in a week.\n\n- **Potential Factors:**\n  - **Voting Law Changes:** While there have been changes to Pennsylvania's voting laws since 2020, such as date requirements on return envelopes, these are unlikely to disproportionately affect Democratic voters to the extent that their share of returns drops below 66.7%.\n  - **Voter Enthusiasm:** Although there are concerns about voter enthusiasm levels among Pennsylvania Democrats compared to previous years, the high number of mail ballot requests indicates sustained engagement in mail voting.\n\n- **Uncertainties:**\n  - **Return Rates:** Not all requested ballots are returned, and return rates can vary between parties.\n  - **Data Reporting:** There could be delays or inconsistencies in data reporting from VoteHub's Early Voting Tracker.\n  - **Legal Challenges:** Ongoing legal issues or challenges could affect the counting of certain mail ballots, but it's uncertain if this would significantly impact the overall percentages.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the substantial lead in mail ballot requests by Democrats, historical voting patterns, and the limited time remaining before October 31, it is highly likely that Democrats will constitute 66.7% or more of the mail and absentee ballots returned in Pennsylvania as reported by VoteHub's Early Voting Tracker.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 85%**", "probability": 85}
