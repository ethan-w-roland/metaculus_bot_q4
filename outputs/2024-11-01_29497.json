    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nIn Nebraska will Initiative 439, the Right to Abortion Initiative, receive more votes than Initiative 434, the Prohibit Abortions After the 1st Trimester Amendment?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Nebraska Initiative 439 receives more votes than Initiative 434 in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reporting. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Nebraska Initiative 434, Prohibit Abortions After the First Trimester Amendment (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Nebraska_Initiative_434,_Prohibit_Abortions_After_the_First_Trimester_Amendment_(2024)); Ballotpedia: [Nebraska Initiative 439, Right to Abortion Initiative (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Nebraska_Initiative_439,_Right_to_Abortion_Initiative_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo predict whether Initiative 439, the Right to Abortion Initiative, will receive more votes than Initiative 434, the Prohibit Abortions After the 1st Trimester Amendment, in Nebraska, here are some key points and contextual information that could be relevant:\n\n## Competing Measures\n- Initiative 439 and Initiative 434 are competing ballot measures that present conflicting views on abortion. Initiative 439 aims to establish a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient, while Initiative 434 seeks to prohibit abortions after the first trimester, except for medical emergencies, rape, or incest.\n\n## Current Abortion Laws in Nebraska\n- Currently, abortion is banned after 12 weeks of pregnancy in Nebraska, with exceptions for saving the life of the mother, preventing serious risk to the physical health of the mother, and if the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. This context may influence voter decisions.\n\n## Public and Organizational Support\n- Initiative 439 is supported by organizations such as the ACLU, Planned Parenthood, and Nebraska Appleseed, which are advocating for the removal of current restrictions on abortion. On the other hand, Initiative 434 is supported by anti-abortion groups, including Nebraska Right to Life, which argue for stricter abortion limits.\n\n## Voter Sentiment and Historical Context\n- This is the first time in Nebraska’s history that voters will decide on conflicting abortion-related ballot measures on the same ballot. This uniqueness could impact voter turnout and decision-making.\n\n## Campaign Efforts and Messaging\n- Both campaigns are actively engaging in educational and advocacy efforts. The Protect Our Rights campaign for Initiative 439 emphasizes personal medical decisions and ending government interference, while the Protect Women & Children campaign for Initiative 434 focuses on safeguarding women’s health care with clear abortion limits and exceptions.\n\n## Signature Collection and Volunteer Efforts\n- Both initiatives have successfully collected the necessary signatures to appear on the ballot, indicating significant support from different segments of the population. The Protect Women & Children initiative collected over 205,000 signatures in a record time, showing strong mobilization.\n\nGiven these points, it is challenging to definitively predict which initiative will receive more votes without additional data on voter sentiment, polling results, and the effectiveness of the campaigns. However, understanding the current laws, the support bases of each initiative, and the historical context can provide a more informed perspective for making a prediction.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, abortion-related ballot measures can be highly polarizing and often reflect broader societal and political divisions.\n- The outcome may depend on factors such as voter turnout, particularly among groups with strong opinions on abortion, and the effectiveness of campaign messaging.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The election is scheduled for November 5, 2024, providing a clear timeline for resolution.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The current political and social climate, including recent national and state-level debates on abortion, could influence voter decisions.\n\nWithout specific polling data or more detailed insights into voter sentiment, it is not possible to clearly answer whether Initiative 439 will receive more votes than Initiative 434. The outcome will depend on various factors, including campaign effectiveness, voter turnout, and the prevailing attitudes towards abortion in Nebraska.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the campaign for Initiative 439 raised more money than the campaign for Initiative 434?\nANSWER: No, the campaign for Initiative 439 has not raised more money than the campaign for Initiative 434.\n\nAccording to the campaign finance reports, the supporters of Initiative 439 have raised approximately $6.7 million, while the opponents of Initiative 439 (who support Initiative 434) have raised around $7.1 million.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any recent polling data shown that Initiative 439 is more popular than Initiative 434 among Nebraskan voters?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is some polling data that sheds light on the popularity of the two initiatives, but it does not conclusively show that Initiative 439 is more popular than Initiative 434.\n\nAn October poll mentioned in the sources indicates that a plurality of Nebraskans support both initiatives, with 44 percent supporting Initiative 439 and 46 percent supporting Initiative 434.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as the polling data does not show a clear majority or greater support for Initiative 439 over Initiative 434.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it common for Nebraskan voters to approve constitutional amendments that expand rights?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether it is common for Nebraskan voters to approve constitutional amendments that expand rights, specifically in the context of abortion or other issues.\n\nWhile the sources indicate that Nebraska voters will be considering two competing abortion measures in the upcoming election, and that there has been a trend in other states where voters have supported abortion rights in ballot measures since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, they do not provide historical data or trends specific to Nebraska's voter behavior on constitutional amendments expanding rights.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major endorsements in Nebraska favored Initiative 439 over Initiative 434?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it is clear that several major organizations and groups in Nebraska have endorsed Initiative 439 over Initiative 434.\n\n- Initiative 439 is supported by organizations such as the ACLU of Nebraska, Ballot Initiative Strategy Center, Nebraska Appleseed, Nebraska Civic Engagement Table, and Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska.\n- The Protect Our Rights campaign, which is a coalition of Nebraskans and local reproductive health, rights, and justice organizations, is actively working to support Initiative 439 and opposes Initiative 434.\n\nIn contrast, there is no mention of significant endorsements for Initiative 434 from major organizations or groups in these sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout among young voters in Nebraska expected to be higher than usual in the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the expectation for voter turnout among young voters in Nebraska for the 2024 election is not explicitly stated. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The sources discuss general trends and challenges in youth voter registration and turnout, but they do not provide specific projections for the 2024 election in Nebraska.\n- One source does mention that all-mail voting in some rural Nebraska counties has led to higher voter turnout in general, but it does not specify whether this trend will continue or apply specifically to young voters in the 2024 election.\n\nGiven this information, the answer to whether voter turnout among young voters in Nebraska is expected to be higher than usual in the 2024 election is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Initiative 439 received more volunteer support and grassroots activism than Initiative 434?\nANSWER: The information provided does not offer a clear comparison of the volunteer support and grassroots activism between Initiative 439 and Initiative 434.\n\n- Initiative 439 is supported by a coalition of Nebraskans, local reproductive health, rights, and justice organizations, and it mentions grassroots organizations and medical professionals, but it does not provide specific numbers or comparisons to Initiative 434.\n- Initiative 434 is supported by various organizations such as the Nebraska Catholic Conference, Nebraska Family Alliance, and Nebraska Right to Life, among others. It also mentions significant financial support and campaign efforts, but again, there is no direct comparison to the volunteer and grassroots support for Initiative 439.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has media coverage in Nebraska been more favorable towards Initiative 439 than Initiative 434?\nANSWER: The available sources do not provide a clear indication that media coverage in Nebraska has been more favorable towards Initiative 439 than Initiative 434. Here are some key points:\n\n- The sources highlight the confusion and complexity of the dueling initiatives, but they do not analyze the media coverage's favorability towards one initiative over the other.\n- They discuss the tactics and advertisements used by both sides, including misleading tactics by anti-choice groups, but do not assess the overall media coverage's bias.\n- The focus is more on explaining the initiatives, the confusion among voters, and the implications of the votes rather than evaluating the media's stance on the initiatives.\n\nGiven this, the answer to whether media coverage has been more favorable towards Initiative 439 than Initiative 434 is unclear based on the provided sources.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nebraska historically voted for pro-choice measures in ballot initiatives?\nANSWER: Based on the available information, it is unclear whether Nebraska has historically voted in favor of pro-choice measures in ballot initiatives.\n\nWhile there have been several abortion-related ballot measures across various states, the specific historical voting patterns in Nebraska on pro-choice measures are not detailed in the provided sources. Here are some key points:\n\n- The sources discuss upcoming ballot measures in Nebraska for 2024, such as Initiative 439, which aims to establish a right to abortion until fetal viability, and Initiative 434, which seeks to prohibit abortions after the first trimester with certain exceptions.\n- Historical data on abortion-related ballot measures across the U.S. shows mixed outcomes, but it does not provide specific historical voting trends for Nebraska.\n\nTherefore, without specific historical data on Nebraska's past voting patterns on pro-choice ballot initiatives, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do demographic trends in Nebraska indicate increasing support for abortion rights?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there are several indicators that suggest increasing support for abortion rights in Nebraska:\n\n1. **Polling Data**: A 2014 Pew Research Center poll found that 50% of Nebraskan adults believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 46% believed it should be illegal in most or all cases. However, more recent polling data shows an increase in support. For example, a 2023 American Values Atlas reported that 51% of Nebraskans said abortion should be legal in all or most cases.\n\n2. **Recent Surveys**: A November 2022 Hart Research poll found that 59% of Nebraskans opposed further abortion restrictions, with 48% strongly opposed, indicating a shift towards more support for abortion rights.\n\n3. **Ballot Initiatives**: The fact that a group of reproductive rights activists was able to gather more than 207,000 signatures for the initiative to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, significantly exceeding the required number, suggests strong public support for this cause.\n\nThese trends collectively indicate an increase in support for abortion rights among the population in Nebraska.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant shift in public opinion in Nebraska towards supporting abortion rights in recent years?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no clear indication of a significant shift in public opinion in Nebraska towards supporting abortion rights in recent years, but there are some consistent trends and insights:\n\n1. **Current Polling**: Recent polls show that Nebraskans are closely divided on the issue. For example, a poll mentioned that 46% of Nebraskans support Initiative 434 (the anti-abortion measure), while 44% support Initiative 439 (the pro-abortion rights measure).\n\n2. **Historical Context**: Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, there has been ongoing debate and voting on abortion measures. However, the polls do not indicate a significant shift in one direction. In 2022, a poll showed that 50% of Nebraskans believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases, and 46% believed it should be illegal in all or most cases.\n\n3. **Consistency in Opinions**: The opinions seem to remain relatively stable, with a slight majority or near-even split between those supporting and opposing abortion rights. There is no clear evidence of a significant shift in either direction in recent years.\n\nGiven this information, the answer would be:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: 4 days remain until the general election on **November 5, 2024**.\n\n---\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed**: If current trends and polling hold steady, **Initiative 434** would receive more votes than **Initiative 439**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: With just **1 day** remaining, the probability that **Initiative 439** receives more votes than **Initiative 434** would remain low, around **40%**.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left**: With **16 days** until the election, there would be more opportunity for shifts in voter sentiment. The probability that **Initiative 439** receives more votes might increase slightly to around **45%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nCurrent polling data suggests a tight race between the two initiatives. An October poll indicates that **46%** of Nebraskans support **Initiative 434** (Prohibit Abortions After the First Trimester), while **44%** support **Initiative 439** (Right to Abortion Initiative). This narrow margin shows **Initiative 434** holding a slight lead.\n\n**Financial Backing**: The campaign for **Initiative 434** has raised approximately **$7.1 million**, slightly more than the **$6.7 million** raised by **Initiative 439**. This financial edge may allow **Initiative 434** to have more robust outreach in the final days before the election.\n\n**Endorsements and Support**: **Initiative 439** has garnered major endorsements from organizations like the **ACLU of Nebraska**, **Planned Parenthood Advocates of Nebraska**, and **Nebraska Appleseed**. These endorsements could mobilize voters who support abortion rights.\n\n**Demographic Trends**: There is evidence of increasing support for abortion rights in Nebraska. Recent surveys indicate that **51%** of Nebraskans believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Additionally, the significant number of signatures collected for **Initiative 439** (over **207,000**) suggests strong grassroots support.\n\n**Historical Voting Patterns**: It is **unclear** whether Nebraska voters typically approve constitutional amendments that expand rights, particularly regarding abortion. Without this historical context, it's challenging to predict voter behavior based solely on past trends.\n\n**Time Constraints**: With only **4 days** left until the election, the window for significant shifts in voter opinion is narrow. Last-minute campaigning and get-out-the-vote efforts may have limited impact on changing the current trajectory.\n\n**Conclusion**: Considering the slight lead of **Initiative 434** in polling and fundraising, the major endorsements and demographic trends favoring **Initiative 439**, and the limited time remaining, the probability that **Initiative 439** will receive more votes than **Initiative 434** is estimated at **40%**.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 40%**",
