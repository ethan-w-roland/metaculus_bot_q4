The Texas Commission has the authority to call off the fight permanently if Tyson develops any more episodes of his stomach ulcer.\n\n## Classification of the Fight\nThe Texas Combative Sports Program will decide whether the fight will be classified as an exhibition or a sanctioned pro fight.

    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nFrom November 6, 2024, to January 1, 2025, there are approximately **56 days** remaining.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there were no confirmed plans for Mike Tyson to participate in a public boxing match before January 1, 2025. If nothing changed from that point, the outcome would be that **Mike Tyson does not have a public boxing match** before the specified date.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **14 days** left until January 1, 2025, and no known scheduled fights, the probability of Mike Tyson having a public boxing match would be **very low**.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **224 days** (about seven months) until January 1, 2025, the probability would be slightly higher due to more time for a potential match to be arranged, but it would still be **low** without any confirmed plans.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Mike Tyson's Recent Activities:** As of October 2023, Mike Tyson has not announced any official plans to return to professional boxing. His last match was an exhibition bout against Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020. While there have been rumors and speculations about potential fights with personalities like Jake Paul, none have been confirmed.\n\n- **Age and Physical Considerations:** Mike Tyson would be 58 years old in 2024. Given his age and the physical demands of boxing, it is less likely he would participate in a professional bout. Health and safety regulations might also pose challenges for licensing a fight.\n\n- **Logistical Constraints:** Organizing a high-profile boxing match involves extensive negotiations, training camps, promotions, and securing venues. With only 56 days remaining, it is unlikely that all these arrangements could be made without any prior announcement.\n\n- **Regulatory Hurdles:** Athletic commissions require medical examinations and approvals, which can take time, especially for older athletes. Any health concerns could delay or prevent a fight from being sanctioned.\n\n- **Historical Behavior:** While Tyson has shown interest in exhibition matches for charity, there has been no concrete move towards scheduling a professional fight since his retirement. The base rate of retired boxers of his age returning to the ring is extremely low.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
