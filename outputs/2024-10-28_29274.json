    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Mayor Brandon Scott receive 70% of the vote in the 2024 Baltimore mayoral race?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-28\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Brandon Scott receives greater than or equal to 70.00% of the vote in the 2024 Baltimore mayoral election. If he does not meet this threshold for any reason (including Scott dropping out of the race), this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFrom Wikipedia: \"The 2024 Baltimore mayoral election will be held on November 5, 2024, to elect the mayor of Baltimore, Maryland. Incumbent Brandon Scott was first elected in 2020 with 70.5% of the vote and is running for re-election to a second term.[1] Scott was considered vulnerable, as polls found that Baltimore residents were split on his performance as mayor.[2] He faced criticism for his handling of important issues in the city, including schools, constituent services, and crime.[3] However, Scott's response to the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse, as well as his progress in growing the economy and reducing homicides, allowed him to make inroads with voters and boost his approval rating.[4][5] Scott defeated former mayor Sheila Dixon in the Democratic primary, a result that is considered tantamount to victory in the heavily Democratic city.[6] His path to victory involved running up massive margins in Baltimore's majority-white precincts while running close to Dixon in its majority-Black areas.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Mayor Brandon Scott will receive 70% of the vote in the 2024 Baltimore mayoral race, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Democratic Primary Outcome\nBrandon Scott has already won the Democratic primary, defeating his main challenger, Sheila Dixon. Given that Baltimore is a heavily Democratic city, winning the Democratic primary is often tantamount to winning the general election.\n\n## General Election Dynamics\nIn the general election, Scott will face Republican nominee Shannon Wright, among other candidates. However, the Democratic Party's strong dominance in Baltimore makes it unlikely that the Republican candidate will pose a significant challenge.\n\n## Historical Context\nIn his 2020 election, Brandon Scott won with 70.5% of the vote. However, this was a different electoral context, and his current performance and voter sentiment may vary. Despite criticisms and challenges during his first term, Scott has made notable progress in areas such as public safety and economic growth, which could influence voter support.\n\n## Current Voter Sentiment\nWhile Scott has faced criticism on various issues, his response to significant events like the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse and his efforts to reduce homicides have been positively received by some voters. However, it is unclear whether this will translate into the same level of support as in his previous election.\n\n## Base Rates and Historical Precedents\nGiven the historical context and the current political landscape, it is not clear if Scott will replicate the exact percentage of votes he received in 2020. The primary results showed him winning with about 52.8% of the Democratic primary votes, which is lower than his 2020 general election percentage.\n\nIn conclusion, while Brandon Scott is likely to win the general election due to Baltimore's strong Democratic lean, it is uncertain whether he will receive exactly 70% of the vote. The final outcome will depend on various factors, including voter turnout, campaign performance, and any last-minute developments. Therefore, the answer to whether he will receive 70% of the vote is not immediately clear based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Brandon Scott receive over 70% of the vote in the 2020 Baltimore mayoral election?\nANSWER: YES\n\nIn the 2020 Baltimore mayoral election, Brandon Scott received 70.5% of the votes, which is over 70%.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Brandon Scott currently polling at or above 70% in pre-election polls for the 2024 Baltimore mayoral race?\nANSWER: NO\n\nBased on the sources provided, none of the polls indicate that Brandon Scott is currently polling at or above 70% in the 2024 Baltimore mayoral race.

Freeman, plans to sue Mayor Brandon Scott for allegedly being fired due to his support for Sheila Dixon in the Democratic primary. Freeman claims this was an act of retaliation and also alleges reverse discrimination and racial discrimination.\n\n2. **Hiring of Campaign Treasurer as Senior Advisor**: There has been criticism over the hiring of Calvin A. Young, Scott's former campaign treasurer, as a senior advisor to the mayor. This move has raised questions about the separation of politics and governance.\n\n3. **Allegations Against Calvin Young and EBDI**: Calvin Young, now a senior advisor to Scott, is also involved in a controversy related to his actions as the chair of East Baltimore Development Inc. (EBDI), where he allegedly fired employees for their political affiliations and made other questionable decisions.

    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: 8 days (Election Day is on November 5, 2024).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed**: Brandon Scott is likely to win the election but may not secure 70% or more of the vote.\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: Similar to the current forecastâ€”minimal changes are expected in such a short time frame, so the probability would remain about the same.\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left**: With more time, there's increased uncertainty due to potential events that could affect voter sentiment. The probability might slightly decrease because longer time frames allow for unforeseen developments.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Historical Performance**:\n   - In the **2020 Baltimore mayoral election**, Brandon Scott received **70.5%** of the vote. This indicates that achieving 70% is possible for him under favorable conditions.\n   \n2. **Democratic Dominance in Baltimore**:\n   - Baltimore is a **heavily Democratic city**, and winning the Democratic primary is often tantamount to winning the general election.\n   - The Republican candidate, **Shannon Wright**, and other candidates have not gained significant traction according to available information.\n   \n3. **Current Approval Ratings**:\n   - Scott's approval rating has improved from **37%** to **46%** but remains **below 50%**. This suggests moderate approval but leaves room for opposition or voter apathy.\n   \n4. **Recent Endorsements and Campaign Efforts**:\n   - Scott has received endorsements from influential figures and organizations, including U.S. Senators **Ben Cardin** and **Chris Van Hollen**, and various labor unions.\n   - His campaign highlights achievements like crime reduction and economic growth, which may positively influence voters.\n   \n5. **Reduction in Crime Rates**:\n   - Under Scott's administration, there has been a significant reduction in homicides and violent crime, which is a critical issue for voters.\n   \n6. **Recent Controversies**:\n   - Allegations of improper firings and concerns over the hiring of certain advisors could negatively impact public perception.\n   - While these issues may sway some voters, the overall impact may be limited due to the short time before the election.\n   \n7. **Lack of Strong Opposition Candidates**:\n   - There are no prominent third-party or independent candidates drawing significant support, which may consolidate votes in favor of Scott.\n   \n8. **Voter Turnout Uncertainty**:\n   - Historically, voter turnout in Baltimore mayoral elections can be low, and its impact on election results is uncertain.\n   - Lower turnout could either dilute or concentrate votes, affecting the percentage Scott might receive.\n\n9. **Public Sentiment**:\n   - While some voters are critical of Scott's performance, particularly on issues like education and constituent services, others are encouraged by progress in public safety and economic matters.\n   - Optimism about the city's future is relatively high, which could benefit the incumbent.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nConsidering all these factors, while Brandon Scott is very likely to win the election, achieving **70% or more of the vote** is uncertain. The combination of his improved but still moderate approval ratings, recent endorsements, and achievements suggests a favorable outcome. However, recent controversies and the possibility of voter dissatisfaction may prevent him from reaching the 70% threshold.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
