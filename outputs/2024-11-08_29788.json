    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill 10 or 11 U.S. federal executive department heads be announced by the incoming administration between the election and December 16, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-08\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the total number of federal executive department heads officially announced as nominees by the new U.S. President-elect or their transition team after November 5, 2024, and before December 16, 2024, is 10-11 out of the total of 15 (listed in the Fine Print) according to credible sources. If a different number of nominees is announced, this question resolves as No.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- If a nominee is announced, it will count for resolution independently of potential retractions or refusals on the part of the nominee.\r\n- Reports that the new president-elect *will* announce an executive department head do not count for the resolution of this question if the announcement itself has not taken place.\r\n- Official announcements that the President-elect intends to retain an incumbent in their position will count for resolution.\r\n- Senate confirmation is not required for this question.\r\n- Only the following 15 [Cabinet positions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-executive-branch/) will affect resolution:\r\n    - Secretary of State\r\n    - Secretary of the Treasury\r\n    - Secretary of Defense\r\n    - Attorney General\r\n    - Secretary of the Interior\r\n    - Secretary of Agriculture\r\n    - Secretary of Commerce\r\n    - Secretary of Labor\r\n    - Secretary of Health and Human Services\r\n    - Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\r\n    - Secretary of Transportation\r\n    - Secretary of Energy\r\n    - Secretary of Education\r\n    - Secretary of Veterans Affairs\r\n    - Secretary of Homeland Security\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFollowing presidential elections in the U.S., new or re-elected presidents announce changes to [the cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States) as part of their transition or continued administration. The Cabinet has 26 members: the vice president, 15 federal executive department heads, and 10 Cabinet-level officials.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the department heads usually happen in the first 10 weeks following election day, but vary in terms of specific timingâ€”from Nixon in 1968 who announced all positions in the six weeks following election day, to Biden in 2020 who announced the three final positions on January 7, 2021 (approximately nine weeks following election day).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether 10 or 11 U.S. federal executive department heads will be announced by the incoming administration between the election and December 16, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context and Process\n- The process of nominating and confirming executive department heads typically begins soon after a presidential election, especially if there is a change in administration. However, the pace can vary significantly depending on the incoming president's priorities and the complexity of the confirmation process.\n\n## Confirmation Process\n- Department heads are nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate. This process can be time-consuming, especially if the Senate is not in session or if there are controversies surrounding the nominees.\n\n## Previous Examples\n- Past administrations have had varying success in announcing and confirming cabinet members quickly. For example, President Biden signed 28 executive orders in his first two weeks, but the confirmation of his cabinet members took longer, with some confirmations happening in the first few weeks and others taking several months.\n\n## Current Political Climate\n- The current political climate, including the level of cooperation between the incoming administration and the Senate, can significantly impact the speed of nominations and confirmations.\n\n## Time Frame\n- The period between the election (presumably in early November 2024) and December 16, 2024, is relatively short. Given the need for Senate confirmation, it is a challenging timeline to confirm a large number of department heads, especially if the Senate is not in continuous session.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, it is rare for a new administration to have more than a few cabinet members confirmed by mid-December following an election. The process is often slower due to the need for background checks, hearings, and Senate votes.\n\nGiven these points, while it is possible for an incoming administration to announce several nominees, the confirmation of 10 or 11 department heads by December 16, 2024, seems unlikely due to the time-consuming nature of the Senate confirmation process. However, the exact number of confirmations can vary widely based on specific circumstances and the efficiency of the process. Therefore, the answer to whether 10 or 11 department heads will be announced and confirmed by that date is not immediately clear and would depend on various factors.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the 2024 President-elect already announced any federal executive department head nominees as of November 8, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 8, 2024, there is no information in the provided sources indicating that the 2024 President-elect, Donald Trump, has announced any federal executive department head nominees.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there reports that the 2024 President-elect plans to announce cabinet positions swiftly?\nANSWER: YES\n\nReports indicate that President-Elect Donald Trump plans to make early announcements focusing on high-profile roles in national security and economic policy, which suggests a swift approach to announcing cabinet positions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the President-elect in the 2024 U.S. presidential election an incumbent president?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe President-elect in the 2024 U.S. presidential election is Donald Trump, who is not the current incumbent president. The incumbent president at the time of the election was Joe Biden, who announced he would not seek a second term.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the winner of the 2024 U.S. presidential election been officially declared as of November 8, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 8, 2024, the winner of the 2024 U.S. presidential election has been officially declared. Sources indicate that Donald Trump has been projected to win the election and has been referred to as the \"President-elect\".\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did previous U.S. administrations announce at least 10 federal executive department head nominees within six weeks after election day?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specify the exact timeline or the number of federal executive department head nominees announced by previous U.S. administrations within six weeks after election day. They discuss the general process of nominations, the types of positions that require Senate confirmation, and historical examples of nominations, but they do not provide detailed information on the timing or quantity of nominations made immediately following an election.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether previous U.S. administrations announced at least 10 federal executive department head nominees within six weeks after election day is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the incoming administration facing political obstacles that might slow down cabinet appointments in 2024?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThe incoming administration, particularly if it is a second term for Donald Trump or any new administration, is likely to face significant political obstacles that could slow down cabinet appointments. Here are some key points:\n\n- The Senate confirmation process has become increasingly slow and contentious over the last 40 years, with delays growing under both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n- Even if Republicans take back the Senate majority, Trump's potential second-term picks will still have to navigate tight Senate margins and potential slow-walking of the confirmation process by Democrats.\n- Historical data shows that the confirmation process for executive branch nominees has become more difficult, with fewer nominees being confirmed by the Senate and longer confirmation times.\n- The need for Senate approval and the potential for contentious nominations can lead to delays and tough questioning during Senate confirmation hearings.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the 2024 President-elect have a well-prepared transition team ready to facilitate prompt cabinet nominations?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it appears that the 2024 President-elect, Donald Trump, has a transition team in place, but there are some indications that the preparation and readiness of this team may not be optimal.\n\n- The transition team was formed relatively late, with the announcement made on August 16, 2024, which is considered unusually late compared to historical standards.\n- There have been reports of internal tensions and potential conflicts of interest, such as those surrounding co-chair Howard Lutnick.\n- Trump has refused to sign standard agreements around ethics and disclosure, which has delayed key aspects of the transition process.\n- Despite these challenges, the transition team is led by co-chairs Linda McMahon and Howard Lutnick, and includes other notable figures such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard. However, the overall preparation and the team's readiness to facilitate prompt cabinet nominations are not clearly indicated as being well-prepared.\n\nGiven these points, the answer to whether the 2024 President-elect has a well-prepared transition team ready to facilitate prompt cabinet nominations is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there major national or international events in 2024 that could impact the timing of cabinet announcements?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several major national and international events in 2024 that could impact the timing and context of cabinet announcements for President-elect Donald Trump.\n\n1. **Election Outcomes and Transition**: The ongoing process of finalizing election results, particularly in states like Arizona, and the transition to the new administration could influence the timing of cabinet announcements. As the transition team works to assemble the cabinet, they must navigate the confirmation process and build relationships with Congress, which can be affected by the overall political landscape.\n\n2. **Global Elections and Climate Events**: 2024 is marked by significant global elections and climate-related events. For instance, the UNâ€™s 29th annual climate conference (COP29) in November 2024 will be a critical international event that may require early engagement from key cabinet members, potentially influencing the timing of their announcements.\n\n3. **Senate Confirmation Hearings**: The cabinet selection process involves Senate confirmation hearings, which can take weeks or months. This process can be delayed or expedited based on the level of scrutiny from Senate committees, affecting the timing of when cabinet members are officially announced and confirmed.\n\n4. **Domestic and International Policy Priorities**: Given the immediate priorities in areas such as national security, economic policy, and climate action, Trump's team may need to announce key cabinet positions quickly to establish a stable foundation and communicate the administrationâ€™s top priorities. This could be influenced by ongoing global tensions and domestic issues.\n\nThese factors suggest that the timing of cabinet announcements will be influenced by a combination of national and international events.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there historical precedent for announcing 10 or 11 cabinet nominees between election day and December 16 in prior U.S. elections?\nANSWER: Yes, there is historical precedent for announcing multiple cabinet nominees between election day and mid-December in prior U.S. elections.\n\nFor example, during the transition period of President Joe Biden, several cabinet nominees were announced between the election day (November 3, 2020) and December 16, 2020. Here are some of the key announcements:\n\n- Secretary of State: Antony Blinken, announced on November 23, 2020.\n- Secretary of the Treasury: Janet Yellen, announced on November 30, 2020.\n- Secretary of Defense: Lloyd Austin, announced on December 9, 2020.\n- Secretary of Education: Miguel Cardona, announced on December 23, 2020.\n- Secretary of Energy: Jennifer Granholm, announced on December 17, 2020.\n- Secretary of Health & Human Services: Xavier Becerra, announced on December 8, 2020.\n- Secretary of Homeland Security: Alejandro Mayorkas, announced on November 23, 2020.\n- Secretary of Housing & Urban Development: Marcia Fudge, announced on December 8, 2020.\n- Secretary of the Interior: Deb Haaland, announced on December 19, 2020.\n\nSimilarly, during Donald Trump's transition, several cabinet nominees were announced between the election day (November 8, 2016) and December 16, 2016, including:\n- Secretary of the Treasury: Steven Mnuchin, announced on November 30, 2016.\n- Secretary of Defense: Jim Mattis, announced on December 1, 2016.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that it is common for presidents-elect to announce multiple cabinet nominees in the period between the election and mid-December.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any ongoing legal challenges or recounts that could delay the transition process after the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several scenarios where legal challenges or recounts could potentially delay or impact the transition process after the 2024 election:\n\n## Recounts\n- In Wisconsin, the Senate race between Tammy Baldwin and Eric Hovde is close enough to qualify for a recount if requested by the candidate, which could potentially delay the finalization of the Senate race outcome.\n- In Michigan, the Senate race between Elissa Slotkin and Mike Rogers is also close, and while it does not automatically qualify for a recount, a candidate can request one if they have a \"good-faith\" reason to believe \"fraud or mistake\" has impacted the results.\n- In Pennsylvania, the Senate race between Dave McCormick and Bob Casey is headed for an automatic recount due to the margin being within the required threshold.\n- In Nevada, the Senate race between Jacky Rosen and Sam Brown is close, and a candidate can request a recount within three working days after the canvass of the vote.\n\n## Legal Challenges\n- Candidates can file official contests of the certified results or bring other legal actions challenging aspects of the election, which could delay the finalization of election outcomes. However, the bar for such litigation is high, requiring proof of harm that impacted enough ballots to change the outcome.\n\n## Expedited Processes\n- While new laws and court rules in Arizona aim to expedite vote counts and legal challenges, there are still deadlines and procedures that must be followed, which could influence the timing of the transition process.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that there are ongoing and potential legal challenges and recounts that could delay the transition process after the 2024 election.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nThere are approximately **38 days** remaining until December 16, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and December 16, 2024, and no federal executive department head nominees were announced, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about **10 days** left until December 16, 2024, I would forecast a **lower probability** that 10 or 11 nominees would be announced by the deadline.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were hypothetically **152 days** remaining until December 16, 2024, I would forecast a **higher probability** that 10 or 11 nominees would be announced by the deadline.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Historical Precedent:**\n   - In previous transitions, it is typical for incoming presidents to announce several cabinet nominees between election day and mid-December. However, announcing **10 or 11 out of the 15 federal executive department heads** within this timeframe is less common.\n   - For example, during the 2016 transition, President-elect Donald Trump announced approximately **7 department head nominees** by mid-December.\n   - Similarly, President-elect Joe Biden in 2020 announced several key nominees, but not all 15, before December 16.\n\n2. **Current Status:**\n   - As of November 8, 2024, **no federal executive department head nominees have been announced** by President-elect Donald Trump.\n   - Reports indicate that the transition team was formed **relatively late**, and there are concerns about its preparedness due to internal tensions and refusal to sign standard ethics agreements.\n\n3. **Political Obstacles:**\n   - The incoming administration may face **political challenges** that could slow down cabinet appointments, such as:\n     - **Senate confirmation delays** due to increased partisanship.\n     - **Ongoing legal challenges** and recounts in key states, potentially distracting from the transition process.\n     - **Opposition from Congress**, especially if control is divided between parties.\n\n4. **Time Constraints:**\n   - With only **38 days** remaining, the timeframe is **tight** for the announcement of 10 or 11 department head nominees.\n   - Background checks, vetting, and formal announcements take time, and the upcoming holidays may further slow the process.\n\n5. **Impact of Additional Time:**\n   - If there were **more time available**, the probability of reaching the 10 or 11 nominee threshold would increase.\n   - Conversely, with **less time**, the likelihood decreases, as the administrative processes are constrained.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the **historical patterns**, current **political climate**, and **time constraints**, it is **unlikely** that 10 or 11 federal executive department head nominees will be announced by December 16, 2024.\n   - While not impossible, the factors suggest a **low to moderate probability**.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 30%**",
