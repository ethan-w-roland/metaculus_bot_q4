Otherwise this question resolves as **No.**\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe Sporting News: [Will Cowboys fire Mike McCarthy? Why embattled coach is on hot seat after Dallas starts 1-2](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/will-cowboys-fire-mike-mccarthy-coach-hot-seat/3ff1abbba7137a60366b2851)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Mike McCarthy will be the Dallas Cowboys head coach on January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Status\nAs of January 2024, Mike McCarthy has been confirmed to return as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys for the 2024 season. This decision was made by owner and general manager Jerry Jones following a wild-card loss to the Green Bay Packers.\n\n## Contract\nMike McCarthy has one year remaining on his contract, which would take him through the 2024 season.\n\n## Performance and Speculation\nWhile there is speculation about potential coaching changes in the future, there is no concrete indication that McCarthy will be fired or leave before the end of his contract. Speculations about replacements, such as Bobby Slowik or Bill Belichick, are based on hypothetical scenarios rather than confirmed plans.\n\n## Owner's Support\nJerry Jones has expressed strong support for McCarthy, highlighting his regular-season success and the team's overall progress under his leadership. This suggests that unless there is a significant downturn in performance or other unforeseen circumstances, McCarthy is likely to see out his current contract.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that, as of now, Mike McCarthy is likely to remain the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys until at least the end of the 2024 season. However, whether he will still be in the position on January 1, 2025, depends on the team's performance and any decisions made after the 2024 season.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- **Coaching Tenure**: The average tenure of an NFL head coach is relatively short, but McCarthy has already been with the Cowboys for several years and has the support of the owner.\n- **Performance**: The team's performance in the 2024 season will be a critical factor in determining McCarthy's future.\n\n### Time to Resolution\nThe answer to whether Mike McCarthy will be the head coach on January 1, 2025, will become clearer after the 2024 NFL season, when the team's performance and any subsequent coaching decisions are evaluated.\n\nIn summary, while there is no definitive answer as of now, the current information suggests that Mike McCarthy is likely to remain the head coach through the 2024 season, but his status beyond that is subject to the team's performance and future decisions.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Mike McCarthy currently under contract with the Dallas Cowboys through the 2024 season?\nANSWER: YES\n\nMike McCarthy is currently in the final year of his contract with the Dallas Cowboys, which means he is under contract through the 2024 season.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the Dallas Cowboys make the playoffs in the 2023 NFL season?\nANSWER: YES, the Dallas Cowboys made the playoffs in the 2023 NFL season. They clinched a playoff spot despite a loss to the Buffalo Bills, and they ultimately lost in the Wild Card Round to the Green Bay Packers.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Jerry Jones fired a head coach after a winning season in the past?\nANSWER: Yes, Jerry Jones has fired a head coach after a winning season in the past. One notable example is the firing of Jimmy Johnson. Despite the Cowboys winning two consecutive Super Bowls under Johnson's leadership, Jones and Johnson had significant differences that led to Johnson's departure after the 1993 season, which was a winning season and ended in a Super Bowl victory.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Mike McCarthy led the Dallas Cowboys to significant postseason success in recent seasons?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nMike McCarthy has not led the Dallas Cowboys to significant postseason success in recent seasons. Despite achieving multiple 12-win regular seasons, the Cowboys have had limited success in the playoffs under his leadership. They have a 1-3 postseason record over the last three seasons, including home losses and failures to advance beyond the wild card or divisional rounds.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any health issues that might lead Mike McCarthy to resign before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of any health issues that might lead Mike McCarthy, the Dallas Cowboys head coach, to resign before January 1, 2025.\n\nThe sources mention that Mike McCarthy underwent an appendectomy in December 2023, but he recovered well and was set to return to his coaching duties immediately after the surgery.\n\nThere is no other information suggesting any ongoing or severe health issues that would necessitate his resignation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Dallas Cowboys organization changed head coaches frequently in the past decade?\nANSWER: No, the Dallas Cowboys organization has not changed head coaches frequently in the past decade.\n\nSince 2010, the Cowboys have had only two head coaches:\n- Jason Garrett, who was the head coach from 2010 to 2019.\n- Mike McCarthy, who has been the head coach since the 2020 season.\n\nThis indicates a relatively stable head coaching position over the past decade.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Jerry Jones publicly expressed strong support for Mike McCarthy continuing as head coach?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it appears that Jerry Jones has not publicly expressed strong support for Mike McCarthy continuing as head coach.\n\n- In one instance, Jones criticized McCarthy's play-calling and concepts, which does not indicate strong support.\n- Although Jones has stated that he is not planning to fire McCarthy, his comments have been described as lacking enthusiasm and not wholly endorsing the head coach.\n- There is no clear, strong public statement of support from Jones for McCarthy in the recent context provided by the sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant media speculation about Mike McCarthy being fired before the end of the 2024 season?\nANSWER: Yes, there is significant media speculation about Mike McCarthy being fired before the end of the 2024 season.\n\nSeveral sources indicate that McCarthy's job security is a topic of discussion due to the Cowboys' poor performance, particularly after embarrassing losses such as the 47-9 defeat to the Detroit Lions.\n\n- Dianna Russini reported that Jerry Jones stated he has no plans to fire McCarthy or any coordinators, but this does not rule out future changes.\n- There is ongoing speculation about the possibility of McCarthy being fired mid-season, although it is noted that Jerry Jones rarely makes in-season coaching changes.\n- Various media outlets and analysts are discussing the potential for McCarthy to be let go, either during the season or at its end, due to the team's performance and other factors such as the lack of a clear successor.\n\nThese points collectively indicate significant media speculation on the matter.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Mike McCarthy have a history of completing coaching contracts without early termination?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Mike McCarthy's history with coaching contracts is mixed regarding completion without early termination.\n\n- During his time with the Green Bay Packers, McCarthy was fired after 13 seasons, despite having signed a one-year contract extension in January 2018. He was released on December 2, 2018, before the end of that extended contract.\n\n- With the Dallas Cowboys, McCarthy signed a five-year contract in 2020. However, as of the current information, he is in the final year of this contract without an extension, which suggests that this contract may not be completed with an early termination if he does not receive an extension or a new contract.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, Mike McCarthy does not have a consistent history of completing coaching contracts without early termination.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any prominent available coaches who are rumored to replace Mike McCarthy in the near future?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several prominent coaches who are rumored to be potential replacements for Mike McCarthy as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys in the near future. Here are some of the notable candidates mentioned in the sources:\n\n## Ben Johnson\n- The offensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions, known for his innovative and successful offensive strategies.\n\n## Bobby Slowik\n- The offensive coordinator for the Houston Texans, who has been gaining attention for his work with the team and is seen as a potential first-time head coach candidate.\n\n## Mike Vrabel\n- The former head coach of the Tennessee Titans, who is highly regarded for his coaching abilities and is currently working with the Cleveland Browns. He is considered a strong candidate due to his experience and leadership skills.\n\n## Bill Belichick\n- The former head coach of the New England Patriots, who is one of the most successful coaches in NFL history. There is speculation that he might return to coaching with the Cowboys if they decide to move on from McCarthy.\n\n## Dan Quinn\n- The current defensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys, who has been successful in turning around the team's defense and is a candidate for the head coaching position if McCarthy is let go.\n\n## Lincoln Riley\n- The head coach of the USC Trojans, who has a strong track record in college football and is often mentioned as a potential candidate to transition to the NFL.\n\n## Jim Harbaugh\n- The head coach of the Michigan Wolverines, who has a successful coaching record in both college and the NFL. He is considered a high-profile candidate, although his hiring would come with significant financial considerations.\n\n## Brian Flores\n- The defensive coordinator for the Minnesota Vikings, who has previous head coaching experience with the Miami Dolphins and is gaining attention for his work with the Vikings.\n\nThese coaches are among the top candidates being discussed as potential replacements for Mike McCarthy.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 68 days (about 2 months and one week) until January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** Mike McCarthy would remain the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys on January 1, 2025.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With about 17 days remaining, the probability of McCarthy remaining head coach would be higher due to the minimal time for changes to occur.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:** With approximately 9 months (about 272 days) until the date, the probability of McCarthy remaining head coach would be lower, as there would be more time for potential changes.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Time Frame:** With just over two months until January 1, 2025, there is limited time for a coaching change to occur. Mid-season firings, especially late in the season, are relatively rare unless prompted by extreme circumstances.\n\n- **Organizational Stability:** The Dallas Cowboys have demonstrated a tendency toward coaching stability, having had only two head coaches since 2010. This suggests that the organization is not prone to frequent or impulsive coaching changes.\n\n- **Performance Factors:** The team's performance in the 2024 season plays a critical role. Unless the Cowboys experience a significant downturn or fail to meet expectations drastically, it is unlikely that McCarthy would be dismissed before January 1, 2025.\n\n- **Owner's History:** Jerry Jones, while known for making bold decisions, typically does not fire coaches mid-season. His public comments may not be strongly supportive, but unless there is a clear successor and pressing reason, a mid-season change is improbable.\n\n- **Media Speculation:** While speculation exists about potential replacements, much of it is based on hypothetical scenarios. Without concrete evidence or announcements, these remain speculative.\n\n- **Health and Personal Factors:** There are no indications of health issues or personal reasons that would lead McCarthy to resign before the specified date.\n\n- **Contract Status:** McCarthy's contract runs through the 2024 season. It is reasonable to expect he would at least complete the season before any decisions about his future are made.\n\n**Probability: 85%**", "probability": 85}
