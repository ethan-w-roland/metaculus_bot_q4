{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the UK Abolish the Two-Child Benefit Cap before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-24\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThe UK government must officially abolish the two-child benefit cap before January 1, 2025, for the question to resolve as **Yes**. The cap must be removed in its entirety by this date, not merely announced as a future policy to be implemented. Otherwise the question will resolve as **No**.\n\nThe abolition must be confirmed through an official government announcement, for example from the official [UK Parliament](https://bills.parliament.uk/) which keeps a record of parliamentary bills.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nAnything below an official, complete abolishment of the two-child benefit cap, such as a suspension of it (even if it's an indefinite suspension), an increase in exemptions to it, or an increase in the cap to above 2 children, will not count.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe [two-child benefit cap](http://web.archive.org/web/20240724071807/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_cap), introduced in 2017, restricts child-related benefits to the first two children in a family. This policy has been widely criticized for its impact on child poverty, with [some experts arguing that abolishing it would be one of the most effective measures to reduce the number of children living in poverty](http://web.archive.org/web/20240724072109/https://theconversation.com/the-uks-two-child-limit-on-benefits-is-hurting-the-poorest-families-poverty-experts-on-why-it-should-be-abolished-223371). Despite these arguments, the current Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has [opposed scrapping the cap, citing financial constraints](http://web.archive.org/web/20240724072421/https://news.sky.com/story/government-cannot-commit-to-scrapping-two-child-benefit-cap-without-knowing-how-to-fund-it-says-minister-13183621).\n\n[The Labour Party recently suspended seven MPs who defied the party line by voting against the government on this issue](http://web.archive.org/web/20240724072620/https://news.sky.com/story/who-are-the-seven-rebel-mps-suspended-by-labour-over-two-child-benefit-cap-vote-13184018). This internal conflict highlights the ongoing debate within the party and the broader political landscape.\n\nNonetheless, [according to a recent YouGov poll, 60% of the general public, including 50% of Labour supporters, oppose lifting the cap](http://web.archive.org/web/20240724072925/https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/50140-public-support-retaining-the-two-child-benefit-limit-as-starmer-gears-up-for-first-rebellion). This public sentiment adds another layer of complexity to the policy\u2019s future.\n\nThe removal of the two-child benefit cap could happen via a standalone bill passed by Parliament, [or as part of a finance bill approved by the House of Commons that takes place after the announcement of a government budget](http://web.archive.org/web/20240724144254/https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/explainer/budgets).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nThe question of whether the UK will abolish the two-child benefit cap before January 1, 2025, is complex and uncertain based on the current information.\n\n### Current Status and Policy\nThe two-child benefit cap, introduced by the Conservative government in 2017, has been a contentious issue, particularly among those advocating for the reduction of child poverty. The policy restricts state benefits, including Universal Credit and child tax credits, to the first two children in most households.\n\n### Labour Government's Stance\nThe Labour government, despite facing significant pressure from within its own party and from external campaigners, has not made a firm commitment to abolish the cap. Labour leader Keir Starmer has described the decision as \"tough\" and has emphasized the financial challenges associated with reversing the policy, which is estimated to cost between \u00a32.5 billion and \u00a33.6 billion in 2024-25.\n\n### Ongoing Discussions and Reviews\nThe Labour government has initiated a ministerial taskforce to develop a comprehensive strategy to reduce child poverty, which includes evaluating social security reforms. However, there is no clear timeline or commitment to abolishing the two-child benefit cap as part of this strategy.\n\n### Internal and External Pressure\nThere is significant pressure from Labour MPs, charities, and other stakeholders to scrap the cap. Several Labour MPs have been suspended for supporting an amendment to abolish the cap, and senior figures like Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar and former shadow chancellor John McDonnell have called for its reversal.\n\n### Financial and Policy Considerations\nThe government is also considering the broader financial context and the impact of other policies, such as the overall benefit cap, which complicates the issue. Abolishing the two-child limit alone may not significantly reduce child poverty unless the overall benefit cap is also reformed.\n\nGiven these factors, it is unclear whether the UK will abolish the two-child benefit cap before January 1, 2025. The decision appears to be under review, but no definitive commitment has been made by the Labour government.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has a bill to abolish the two-child benefit cap been passed by the UK Parliament?\nANSWER: No, a bill to abolish the two-child benefit cap has not been passed by the UK Parliament. The recent votes and discussions mentioned in the sources indicate that amendments to scrap the two-child benefit cap have been proposed and voted on, but they were not successful due to the government's substantial majority and the lack of funding commitments from the Labour government.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Conservative Party government announced plans to abolish the two-child benefit cap before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that the Conservative Party is not in power to make such announcements, and the current discussions about abolishing the two-child benefit cap are being considered by the newly elected Labour government. The Labour government has not yet committed to abolishing the cap, but is evaluating it as part of their broader strategy to combat child poverty.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a general election resulting in a government that supports abolishing the two-child benefit cap?\nANSWER: No, there has not been a general election resulting in a government that has committed to abolishing the two-child benefit cap. Although the Labour Party, which won the general election, has faced significant pressure and internal calls to abolish the cap, the current government has only indicated that it will consider the issue as part of a broader review of measures to address child poverty.\n\n- Labour has not made a firm commitment to abolish the cap, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer and other officials highlighting the financial challenges and costs associated with such a move.\n- The government has stated it will review the policy but has not provided a clear timetable for its removal.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the UK government abolished similar caps or restrictions on social benefits since 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the UK government has abolished similar caps or restrictions on social benefits since 2023. Here are the key points:\n\n- The \"two-child limit\" policy, introduced in 2017, is still in place and has not been abolished despite calls for its repeal.\n- The benefit cap, introduced in 2013, was actually increased in April 2023 to keep pace with inflation, but it remains in effect.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the UK government faced legal challenges that could force the abolition of the two-child benefit cap?\nANSWER: Yes, the UK government has faced legal challenges related to the two-child benefit cap.\n\n- There have been legal challenges arguing that the policy breaches parents' and children's human rights. For instance, two single mothers and their children took the case to the Supreme Court, which unanimously dismissed it in July 2021.\n- Additionally, two different families filed complaints with the European Court of Human Rights in December 2021, challenging the policy.\n\nThese legal challenges, while not successful in forcing the abolition of the policy thus far, highlight the ongoing controversy and legal scrutiny the two-child benefit cap has faced.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Labour Party officially committed to abolishing the two-child benefit cap before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the Labour Party has not officially committed to abolishing the two-child benefit cap before January 1, 2025. While there is significant pressure and support within the party to scrap the cap, and some Labour MPs have voted against the government on this issue, the party leadership has not made a definitive commitment to abolish it immediately due to fiscal constraints.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer and other senior officials have acknowledged the issue and the need to address child poverty, but they have emphasized the need for funded solutions and have not set a specific timeline for abolishing the cap before January 1, 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant shift in public opinion favoring the abolition of the two-child benefit cap?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication of a significant shift in public opinion favoring the abolition of the two-child benefit cap.\n\n- A YouGov poll in 2023 and another in July 2024 showed that a majority of the public, around 60%, still support retaining the two-child limit. This includes support from various demographic groups, although there is less support among younger adults (18-24 years old).\n\n- While there are strong arguments and advocacy from various organizations, charities, and some politicians against the two-child limit, the public opinion polls do not reflect a significant shift towards abolishing the cap.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, there has not been a significant shift in public opinion favoring the abolition of the two-child benefit cap.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the two-child benefit cap been linked to significant increases in child poverty, prompting government action?\nANSWER: The two-child benefit cap has been linked to significant increases in child poverty, but it has not yet prompted immediate government action to reverse the policy.\n\n- Official data and various studies have shown that the two-child benefit cap has increased child poverty among larger families. For example, child poverty rates among these families have risen from 41% in 2016/17 to 46% in the latest figures.\n- The policy has resulted in substantial financial losses for affected families, with an average loss of \u00a34,300 annually, which is approximately 10% of their income.\n- Despite the mounting evidence and pressure from various advocacy groups, charities, and some politicians, the current Labour government has shown hesitance to immediately abolish the cap due to fiscal constraints and the need for a comprehensive strategy to address child poverty.\n\nTherefore, while the link to increased child poverty is clear, the government has not yet taken action to reverse the policy. The answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as to government action, but clear on the link to child poverty)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any prominent UK political leaders publicly supported abolishing the two-child benefit cap before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, several prominent UK political leaders have publicly supported abolishing the two-child benefit cap before January 1, 2025.\n\n- Anas Sarwar, the leader of Scottish Labour, has urged Prime Minister Keir Starmer to ditch the cap, describing it as \"wrong\" and in need of reversal.\n- John McDonnell, Labour's former shadow chancellor, has expressed his intention to support an amendment to scrap the cap and stated that it is \"inevitable\" the government would concede on the issue.\n- Gordon Brown, a Labour grandee, has spoken out against the policy, stating it is \"condemning children to poverty\".\n- Rosie Duffield and Kim Johnson, Labour MPs, have been vocal advocates for scrapping the policy, with Johnson urging the government to establish a \"clear timetable\" for its removal.\n- The Scottish National Party (SNP), the Liberal Democrats, and the Green Party have also called for the cap's removal, with their leaders and members actively advocating for its abolition.\n\nThese leaders and parties have made their positions clear through various public statements and parliamentary actions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the UK's economic situation improved to make abolishing the two-child benefit cap more feasible?\nANSWER: To determine if the UK's economic situation has improved to the point where abolishing the two-child benefit cap is more feasible, we need to consider several factors such as GDP growth, inflation, government spending, and overall economic outlook.\n\n### GDP Growth and Economic Outlook\n- The UK economy has shown some improvement, with GDP growth estimated at 0.6% in Quarter 2 2024, following a 0.7% growth in the previous quarter.\n- Forecasts suggest that the UK economy will grow by around 1.0% to 1.1% in 2024, and by 1.0% to 1.3% in 2025, indicating a moderate growth trajectory.\n\n### Inflation and Interest Rates\n- Inflation has been declining and is expected to remain around the Bank of England's 2% target, which is a positive sign for economic stability.\n- Interest rates are expected to be cut gradually, which could boost consumer spending and business investment.\n\n### Government Spending and Fiscal Policy\n- Government spending has been a significant driver of GDP growth this year, but there are concerns about the upcoming budget, which may include tax increases and spending cuts. These measures could impact the feasibility of abolishing the two-child benefit cap.\n\n### Overall Feasibility\nGiven the moderate economic growth, declining inflation, and the expectation of interest rate cuts, the economic situation has improved. However, the feasibility of abolishing the two-child benefit cap also depends on the government's fiscal policy and budget decisions. If the upcoming budget includes significant tax increases or spending cuts, it might not be feasible to abolish the cap without compromising other fiscal priorities.\n\nTherefore, while the economic situation has improved, the specific feasibility of abolishing the two-child benefit cap remains **UNCLEAR** due to the potential impact of upcoming fiscal policy decisions.", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately 69 days remaining until January 1, 2025. This is about 2 months and one week.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf the current political and legislative circumstances remain the same, the UK will not abolish the two-child benefit cap before January 1, 2025. Therefore, the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only about 17 days left until the deadline, and considering the absence of any announced plans or legislative movements to abolish the cap, the probability of the cap being abolished would be very low. I would estimate the probability at **5%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately 276 days remaining (extending the deadline to around July 2025), there would be more opportunity for political developments. However, given the current stance of the government and public opinion, the probability would still be moderate. I would estimate the probability at **20%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Current Political Stance:**\n   - The Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has not committed to abolishing the two-child benefit cap. Despite internal pressure and criticism, the leadership cites financial constraints as a significant barrier.\n   - Several Labour MPs have been suspended for defying the party line, indicating internal division but not a shift in official policy.\n\n2. **Legislative Actions:**\n   - No bill proposing the abolition of the cap has been passed or is currently progressing through Parliament.\n   - The government has not announced any plans to abolish the cap before January 1, 2025.\n\n3. **Public Opinion:**\n   - Recent polls show that 60% of the general public oppose lifting the cap, including 50% of Labour supporters. This puts additional pressure on the government to maintain the status quo.\n\n4. **Time Frame:**\n   - With only about two months remaining, there is limited time for the government to draft, propose, debate, and pass legislation to abolish the cap. Parliamentary procedures can be time-consuming, and there are no indications of expedited efforts.\n\n5. **Economic Considerations:**\n   - The estimated cost of abolishing the cap is significant (\u00a32.5 to \u00a33.6 billion annually), and the government is cautious about increasing expenditures without clear funding mechanisms.\n   - While the UK's economic situation has shown moderate improvement, the government remains focused on fiscal responsibility.\n\n6. **Potential for Change:**\n   - Although there is advocacy and pressure from certain politicians and organizations, substantial policy shifts typically require more time and broader support.\n   - If there were more time (e.g., extending the deadline by several months), there might be increased chances for policy change due to prolonged advocacy and potential shifts in public opinion.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 10%**", "probability": 10}
