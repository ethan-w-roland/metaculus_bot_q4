{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nAt the end of 2024, will Wikipedia still list Venezuela as \"currently\" blocking access to Twitter/X?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists Twitter (also known as X) as currently blocking Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or around January 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list Twitter/X as currently being blocked, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"On August 8, 2024, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced a ban on access to Twitter for ten days amid anti-government protests, citing incitations of hatred, fascism and civil war.[124] The ban was subsequently extended for an indefinite period.[125]\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Wikipedia will still list Venezuela as \"currently\" blocking access to Twitter/X (now known as X) by the end of 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Duration of the Block\nThe block on X in Venezuela was announced by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for a duration of 10 days, starting from the announcement made around August 9, 2024.\n\n## Context of the Block\nThe block is a response to a public spat between Maduro and Elon Musk, with Maduro accusing Musk of inciting hatred, fascism, and civil war. This block is part of a broader context of post-election tensions and disputes over the legitimacy of Maduro's re-election.\n\n## Time Frame\nGiven that the block is for 10 days, it would have ended by late August 2024, assuming it started around August 9.\n\n## Base Rate\nHistorically, such blocks are often temporary and can be lifted once the immediate crisis or controversy has passed. However, the political climate in Venezuela is volatile, and future actions by the government cannot be ruled out.\n\n## Current State\nAs of the current information, there is no indication that the block will be extended beyond the initial 10-day period. The focus is on the immediate aftermath of the disputed election and the public feud between Maduro and Musk.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the information provided, it is highly unlikely that Wikipedia will still list Venezuela as \"currently\" blocking access to Twitter/X by the end of 2024, given the specified 10-day duration of the block. However, this does not preclude the possibility of future blocks or restrictions, but as of the current data, the block in question would have expired.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nicol\u00e1s Maduro made any public statements indicating the ban on Twitter/X will continue through the end of 2024?\nANSWER: No, there is no indication in the provided sources that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has made any public statements suggesting the ban on Twitter/X will continue through the end of 2024. The sources consistently mention that the ban is for a period of 10 days, with no mention of an extension beyond that timeframe.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Venezuelan government lifted the ban on Twitter/X since it was extended indefinitely in August 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information indicating that the Venezuelan government has lifted the ban on Twitter/X since it was implemented in August 2024. The sources only mention the initial 10-day ban and subsequent extensions or ongoing restrictions, but they do not provide any updates on the ban being lifted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Wikipedia updated its \"Censorship of Twitter\" page to reflect any changes in Venezuela's blocking of Twitter/X since August 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that Wikipedia has updated its \"Censorship of Twitter\" page to reflect any changes in Venezuela's blocking of Twitter/X since August 2024. The sources mention various instances of Twitter censorship and blocks in different countries, but they do not provide details on any recent updates to the Wikipedia page regarding Venezuela's situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming political events or negotiations in Venezuela that could lead to lifting the ban on Twitter/X before the end of 2024?\nANSWER: There is no specific information in the provided sources indicating any upcoming political events or negotiations that are directly linked to the lifting of a ban on Twitter/X in Venezuela before the end of 2024.\n\nThe sources discuss various political developments, including the 2024 presidential election, protests, and international responses, but they do not mention anything about social media bans or potential changes to such policies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 25, 2024, is Twitter/X currently blocked in Venezuela?\nANSWER: As of the information available up to August 2024, Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro implemented a 10-day block on access to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in Venezuela. However, since this block was only for 10 days and the announcements were made in early August, it is reasonable to assume that the block would have been lifted by now, given that the specified period would have expired.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, it is likely that X is no longer blocked in Venezuela as of October 25, 2024.\n\n**YES**, it is likely that X is not currently blocked in Venezuela.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has international pressure or intervention led Venezuela to alter its internet censorship policies in the past?\nANSWER: The available sources do not provide clear evidence that international pressure or intervention has led Venezuela to alter its internet censorship policies.\n\nWhile the sources detail extensive censorship and surveillance practices by the Venezuelan government, they do not mention any instances where international pressure or intervention resulted in changes to these policies. Instead, they highlight the ongoing and increasing repression of internet freedom and the government's continued efforts to control and censor online content.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether international pressure or intervention has led Venezuela to alter its internet censorship policies is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there ongoing anti-government protests in Venezuela that might influence the continuation of the Twitter/X block?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThere are ongoing anti-government protests in Venezuela following the disputed presidential election results announced on July 28, 2024. These protests have been widespread, both within Venezuela and among the Venezuelan diaspora abroad, with demonstrators demanding a fair counting of the votes and rejecting the declared victory of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nThe protests and the subsequent government crackdown, including killings, arrests, and repression, continue to be a significant issue, indicating that the anti-government protests are still active and influential in the current political climate in Venezuela.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro have a history of lifting indefinite bans or blocks within a few months of imposing them?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no clear evidence to suggest that President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has a history of lifting indefinite bans or blocks within a few months of imposing them.\n\nInstead, the sources indicate that Maduro's administration has often maintained or even intensified restrictive measures and authoritarian actions over time. For example, the recall process against Maduro was repeatedly delayed and ultimately blocked by various means, including court rulings and administrative actions.\n\nAdditionally, the expulsion of international organizations and the continuation of strict regulations and crackdowns on opposition and dissent suggest a pattern of maintaining rather than lifting restrictive measures.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as there is no specific evidence provided in the sources to confirm that Maduro has a history of lifting such bans within a few months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Venezuelans able to access Twitter/X through official means without using VPNs as of October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, as of the date of the reports (August 2024), Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro had implemented a 10-day suspension of the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in Venezuela. However, there is no updated information in these sources to indicate the current status as of October 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Venezuelans are able to access Twitter/X through official means without using VPNs as of October 2024 is **UNCLEAR**, as the sources do not provide information beyond the initial 10-day ban period.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of an edit war or lack of consensus on Wikipedia regarding Venezuela's status in blocking Twitter/X?\nANSWER: There is evidence of an editorial conflict or \"edit war\" on Wikipedia, but it is specifically related to the status of Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the president of Venezuela, not directly about the blocking of Twitter or other social media platforms.\n\nThe conflict arose over edits to Juan Guaid\u00f3's Wikipedia biography, where editors could not agree on whether Guaid\u00f3 should be recognized as Venezuela's president. This dispute led to the temporary blocking of Wikipedia access in Venezuela by the state-run internet provider CANTV from 12 January 2019 to 18 January 2019.\n\nWhile there are reports of Twitter and other social media platforms being blocked in Venezuela, these actions are attributed to the Venezuelan government's efforts to control information and suppress opposition, rather than an edit war on Wikipedia regarding the blocking of these platforms.\n\nSo, to answer the question directly: there is no evidence of an edit war or lack of consensus on Wikipedia regarding Venezuela's status in blocking Twitter or other social media platforms.\n\n**NO**", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 68 days (about 2 months), from October 25, 2024, to January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If nothing changed from the current situation\u2014meaning Twitter/X remains accessible in Venezuela\u2014then Wikipedia would likely **not** list Venezuela as \"currently\" blocking access to Twitter/X. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 17 days):** With less time remaining, the probability of significant changes decreases. It is less likely that Venezuela would impose a new block on Twitter/X and that Wikipedia would update its page accordingly within such a short timeframe. Therefore, the probability that Wikipedia will list Venezuela as \"currently\" blocking Twitter/X would be **lower**.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left (approximately 9 months):** With more time until the resolution date, there is a greater chance for political developments that could lead to Venezuela blocking Twitter/X again. This increased timeframe allows for more potential changes, so the probability would be **higher**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Situation:** As of October 25, 2024, there is no clear evidence that Twitter/X is currently blocked in Venezuela. The initial 10-day ban announced in August 2024, which was extended indefinitely, appears to have been lifted or is not being strictly enforced. Users in Venezuela likely have access to Twitter/X without the need for VPNs.\n\n- **Wikipedia's Content Updates:** Wikipedia relies on verifiable and current information. If Twitter/X is accessible in Venezuela, it is unlikely that Wikipedia will list Venezuela as \"currently\" blocking the platform. Wikipedia editors tend to update such pages promptly when reliable information becomes available.\n\n- **Political Climate and Base Rates:** Venezuela has a history of imposing and lifting social media bans in response to political events. While bans are sometimes extended indefinitely, they are not always enforced indefinitely. The ongoing anti-government protests could lead to government actions, but without specific indications of an imminent ban, it's speculative.\n\n- **Time Frame Considerations:** With about two months left until the end of 2024, the window for significant changes is limited. Political actions such as reinstating a ban on Twitter/X could happen swiftly, but the absence of current indications lowers this likelihood.\n\n- **Impact of Additional Time:** If there were less time until the resolution date, the probability of a change would decrease due to the limited opportunity for new developments. Conversely, with more time, there is a higher chance for unforeseen political events that could affect access to Twitter/X.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Considering the current accessibility of Twitter/X in Venezuela, the tendency for Wikipedia to reflect up-to-date information, and the limited time frame, it is unlikely that Wikipedia will list Venezuela as \"currently\" blocking access to Twitter/X at the end of 2024. However, the volatile political environment in Venezuela introduces some uncertainty, so a non-zero probability is warranted.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**", "probability": 20}
