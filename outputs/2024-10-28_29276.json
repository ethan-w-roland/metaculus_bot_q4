    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore November 5, 2024, will Kalshi ever show Donald Trump with a 70% chance of winning?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-28\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kalshi, at [this link](https://kalshi.com/markets/pres/presidential-elections), ever shows Donald Trump with a 70% chance of winning for any day before November 5, 2024. If this event does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nKalshi began election trading in the US presidential election on October 4, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Kalshi might show Donald Trump with a 70% chance of winning the presidential election before November 5, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends in Prediction Markets\nAs of the latest updates, prediction markets such as Kalshi and Polymarket have been showing an increasing trend in favor of Donald Trump winning the presidential election. For example, Kalshi's market has recently seen Trump's odds rise, with some reports indicating his odds at around 58% as of late October.\n\n## Market Dynamics\nPrediction markets are influenced by real money bets, and the participants in these markets can include a diverse range of individuals, including international participants. However, these markets are not perfect forecasters and can be skewed by various biases, such as the demographic makeup of the participants (e.g., males tend to favor Trump over Harris).\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Environment\nKalshi recently won a legal battle against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), allowing it to offer election betting contracts legally in the U.S. This has led to increased activity in these markets, but it also introduces potential issues such as manipulation concerns and the influence of large bets on the odds.\n\n## Historical Context and Market Behavior\nWhile the S&P 500's performance has historically been a somewhat reliable indicator of election outcomes (with the incumbent party often winning when the market is up in the months leading to the election), this is not a definitive predictor. The current market conditions and the specific dynamics of this election could lead to different outcomes.\n\n## Probability Threshold\nGiven the current odds around 58% for Trump on Kalshi, it is plausible that the odds could fluctuate and potentially reach a 70% threshold if there is a significant shift in betting patterns or new information that influences the market. However, this would depend on various factors, including new developments in the campaign, changes in public opinion, and the actions of large bettors.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is possible for Kalshi to show Donald Trump with a 70% chance of winning before November 5, 2024, it is not guaranteed. The answer to this question is not immediately clear and would depend on the evolving dynamics of the prediction markets and any significant events that might influence betting behavior.\n\nBased on the available information, the likelihood of reaching a 70% threshold cannot be definitively predicted, but it remains within the realm of possibility given the current trends and the volatile nature of prediction markets.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi ever shown Donald Trump with a 70% or greater chance of winning the 2024 presidential election before October 28, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Kalshi has shown Donald Trump with a 70% or greater chance of winning the 2024 presidential election before October 28, 2024.\n\n- The sources mention various odds from different platforms, but for Kalshi, the highest odds mentioned for Trump are around 57-58%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been large fluctuations in Donald Trump's predicted chances on Kalshi in the past few weeks?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been significant fluctuations in Donald Trump's predicted chances on Kalshi in the past few weeks.\n\n- Trump's odds surged after his pro-crypto campaign and public appearances, particularly after an appearance at a McDonald’s in Pennsylvania, which is a key battleground state.\n- His chances also experienced a decline after the first presidential debate, despite having led the field from the outset.\n- As of recent updates, Kalshi reports Trump leading with around 60% probability, indicating ongoing movement in the prediction markets.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming events before November 5, 2024, that could significantly increase Donald Trump's chances of winning according to Kalshi?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not mention any specific events or analyses from Kalshi that could significantly increase Donald Trump's chances of winning the 2024 presidential election before November 5, 2024. The sources outline various upcoming events such as debates, early voting, and other election-related activities, but they do not include any predictions or analyses from Kalshi or similar entities that would indicate how these events might impact Trump's chances.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently leading in most national polls for the 2024 presidential election?\nANSWER: NO\n\nBased on the sources provided, Kamala Harris is currently leading in the national polls for the 2024 presidential election, not Donald Trump. Here are the specific mentions:\n\n- The BBC report indicates that Kamala Harris has had a small lead over Trump in the national polling averages since she entered the race.\n- The New York Times polling averages show Harris leading by three to four percentage points nationally.\n- The ABC News/Ipsos poll also shows Harris leading Trump 51-47% among likely voters.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has significant negative information about Donald Trump's opponent recently emerged that could impact election odds?\nANSWER: No significant negative information about Donald Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, has recently emerged that could impact the election odds. The sources provided focus primarily on the criticisms and controversies surrounding Donald Trump's campaign, such as his rhetoric, the content of his rallies, and the reactions to those events from various stakeholders.\n\nInstead, the reports highlight how Trump's actions and the comments from his supporters have potentially harmed his own campaign, particularly among certain voter groups like Latinos and moderate Republicans. There is no mention of new, significant negative information about Kamala Harris that could alter the election dynamics.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump's chance of winning the 2024 presidential election on Kalshi currently less than 70%?\nANSWER: To determine if Donald Trump's chance of winning the 2024 presidential election on Kalshi is currently less than 70%, we need to look at the specific probabilities provided by Kalshi's prediction markets.\n\nThe sources provided do not give a direct percentage for Donald Trump's chances of winning. The electoral map based on Kalshi's prediction market odds, as described in, uses categories such as \"Toss-up (<60%), Leans (60%+), Likely (80%+), Safe (95%+)\" but does not provide a precise percentage for Trump's chances.\n\nSince the sources do not provide a specific percentage or enough detail to calculate it accurately, the answer to whether Donald Trump's chance of winning is currently less than 70% is unclear.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do prediction markets like Kalshi typically adjust odds significantly in response to late-breaking news or events?\nANSWER: Prediction markets like Kalshi are designed to reflect the aggregate opinions and bets of their users, and these markets can indeed adjust odds in response to new information or late-breaking news.\n\n- The nature of prediction markets is to aggregate information and adjust odds based on the bets placed by users. When new information or events occur, users may change their bets, which in turn can cause the odds to shift[4|.\n- For example, changes in polling data, significant political events, or other relevant news can lead to adjustments in the odds on platforms like Kalshi as users react to this new information.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to conclude that prediction markets like Kalshi do typically adjust odds significantly in response to late-breaking news or events.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there historical instances of candidates' odds increasing by more than 10% on prediction markets in the week before the election?\nANSWER: While the sources provided do not offer a direct historical example of a candidate's odds increasing by more than 10% in the week before the election, there are indications of significant shifts in betting odds close to election time.\n\nFor instance, Thomas Miller's analysis mentioned in the Fortune article highlights a significant swing in the betting odds over a short period. In the 32 days leading up to October 22, Trump's electoral vote count in Miller's model swung by 252 electoral votes, completely reversing the forecast from September 20 when Harris was leading.\n\nAlthough this specific example does not pinpoint the exact week before the election, it does illustrate that substantial shifts in betting odds can occur in the final weeks leading up to an election.\n\nGiven the lack of a precise historical instance within the week before the election in the provided sources, the answer would be:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Kalshi's presidential election market exhibit high trading volume and liquidity as of October 28, 2024?\nANSWER: As of October 28, 2024, the sources indicate that prediction markets, including those offered by Kalshi, are experiencing significant activity due to the upcoming US presidential elections. Here are the key points:\n\n- The presidential election has generated substantial trading volume, with $2.6 billion in trading volume mentioned for winner-take-all contracts, although this specific figure is from Polymarket.\n- Kalshi has recently opened up the space for trading political contracts after regulatory approvals, which suggests increased activity in these markets.\n- The high engagement in the elections, with around 25 million voters already participating via mail-in ballots or early in-person voting, has spilled over into prediction markets, indicating a lively market environment.\n\nWhile the specific trading volume and liquidity figures for Kalshi's presidential election market are not provided in the sources, the context suggests that the market is active and experiencing significant interest.\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any legal or regulatory action that could hinder Donald Trump's campaign before November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several legal and regulatory actions that could potentially hinder Donald Trump's campaign before November 5, 2024.\n\n1. **Philadelphia Lawsuit Against Elon Musk's Giveaway**: The Philadelphia District Attorney's Office has initiated a lawsuit to halt a $1 million daily giveaway organized by Elon Musk, which is aimed at supporting Trump's campaign. This lawsuit labels the giveaway as an 'illegal lottery' and raises concerns about violating federal statutes prohibiting payments for voting or registering to vote.\n\n2. **Ongoing Legal Cases**: Trump is involved in multiple legal cases, some of which have critical deadlines and hearings around the election time. For example, there are ongoing cases related to election interference, classified documents, and civil fraud, which could impact his campaign. Key dates include various filings and hearings scheduled between October 28 and November 7, 2024.\n\n3. **Justice Department Warning**: The US Department of Justice has issued a warning suggesting that Musk's lottery-style contest might be illegal, which could further complicate Trump's campaign efforts.\n\nThese legal and regulatory actions could create significant challenges and distractions for Trump's campaign in the lead-up to the election.",
    "comment": "(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:\n\nThere are **8 days** left until November 5, 2024.\n\n(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:\n\nIf nothing changed, and Kalshi does not show Donald Trump with a 70% chance of winning before November 5, 2024, the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:\n\nIf there were only **2 days** left, I would forecast a lower probability—around **10%**—that Kalshi would show Trump with a 70% chance of winning.\n\n(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:\n\nIf there were **32 days** left, I would forecast a higher probability—around **25%**—that Kalshi would show Trump with a 70% chance of winning.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of October 28, 2024, Donald Trump's odds on Kalshi are around **58%**, and he has not previously reached the **70%** threshold. With only 8 days remaining until November 5, significant shifts in prediction market odds are less likely but still possible.\n\nPrediction markets like Kalshi do adjust odds in response to late-breaking news or events. However, the subquestions indicate that:\n\n- There are no specific upcoming events expected to significantly boost Trump's chances.\n- There is no significant negative information about his opponent, Kamala Harris, that could negatively impact her odds.\n- Trump's lead in national polls is **not** significant, and in some cases, Harris is leading.\n- Legal actions against Trump could potentially hinder his campaign.\n\nGiven these factors, a major swing of over **12 percentage points** in Trump's favor on Kalshi within 8 days would require an unforeseen, impactful event. While prediction markets can be volatile, such a substantial shift is less probable in this short timeframe.\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
