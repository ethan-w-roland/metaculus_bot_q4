    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill a bilateral ceasefire be announced in the Ukraine war, before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if an armistice or a ceasefire is announced by both Ukraine and Russia before January 1, 2025. This will count if it applies to the majorities of combatants on both the Russian and Ukrainian sides. The ceasefire or armistice must apply to all military operations in all official and disputed Ukrainian and Russian territory. In other words, a limited ceasefire (such as granting safety to humanitarian corridors or specific regions) is insufficient to resolve the question as **Yes**.\n\nThe specific date that such an agreement will take effect is not relevant to the resolution of this question. The only requirement is that the agreement must be announced before January 1, 2025\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFollowing Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, speculation has intensified about the prospects for ending the Russia-Ukraine war. Throughout his campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed he could end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office, though without specifying how.\n\nTrump's recent interactions with key leaders have been notable. He met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in September 2024 at Trump Tower, later describing him as \"the greatest salesman in the world.\" After winning the election, Trump reportedly spoke with both Zelenskyy (in a call that included Elon Musk discussing continued Starlink support) and Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, the Kremlin has denied that the Putin call took place, calling reports from The Washington Post \"pure fiction.\"\n\nMultiple peace proposals are reportedly under consideration by Trump's team, including a potential 800-mile demilitarized zone. Some NATO members, like Slovakia, have begun openly questioning continued military support for Ukraine, while others remain committed. Meanwhile, Russia faces mounting demographic pressures from military losses exceeding 710,000 troops and a severe birth rate crisis.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of a bilateral ceasefire being announced in the Ukraine war before January 1, 2025, here are some key points and contextual information:\n\n## Current State of Negotiations and Proposals\n- There are several peace initiatives and proposals on the table, but none have yet been agreed upon by both Ukraine and Russia. For example, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has presented a \"victory plan\" which includes conditions such as Ukraine's admission into NATO and the use of Western-supplied missiles, but this plan has been dismissed by Russia[1].\n- Russia has shown an interest in peace initiatives proposed by Brazil and China, but these have not led to a concrete agreement[1].\n- Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is planning to submit a peace plan at the G20 summit, which includes freezing the conflict along the current frontlines and other conditions, but the feasibility of this plan is uncertain[2].\n\n## Positions of Key Parties\n- Russia has consistently stated its unwillingness to accept any compromises that would \"freeze\" the conflict along the current frontline, insisting instead on complete Ukraine capitulation[2].\n- Ukraine and its allies on the Security Council advocate for a just peace conditioned on the withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders[1].\n- The United States, under the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming Trump administration, has different approaches. The Biden administration has acknowledged the possibility of a ceasefire with serious security guarantees, while the Trump administration is considering a plan that might involve a ceasefire along current lines but with significant conditions, such as a moratorium on Ukraine’s NATO membership[5].\n\n## Recent Developments and Tensions\n- The conflict remains highly escalated, with recent advancements by Russian forces and the introduction of North Korean troops into the conflict. This escalation has led to increased tensions and rhetoric from both sides[2][4].\n- The use of Western-supplied weapons, particularly the potential authorization for Ukraine to use US-provided ATACMS missiles against Russian targets, has been a point of contention and has further complicated the possibility of a ceasefire[2].\n\n## Base Rates and Historical Context\n- The Ukraine war has been ongoing since February 2022, with numerous failed attempts at ceasefires and peace negotiations. This history suggests that achieving a bilateral ceasefire is challenging and often short-lived[1][4].\n\nGiven these points, while there are ongoing efforts and proposals aimed at achieving a ceasefire, the deep-seated divisions and the unwillingness of key parties to compromise make it uncertain whether a bilateral ceasefire will be announced before January 1, 2025. The complex and often conflicting positions of the involved parties, along with the historical context of failed negotiations, indicate that a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" answer is not immediately evident.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent introduction of North Korean troops into the Ukraine conflict?\nANSWER: YES\n\nRecent reports and intelligence indicate that North Korean troops have been introduced into the context of the Ukraine conflict, although they are currently deployed in Russia's Kursk Oblast rather than directly in Ukraine. Sources confirm that North Korean troops have been training and deploying to Kursk Oblast to support Russian forces[2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Turkey submitted a peace plan at the G20 summit that includes freezing the conflict along current frontlines?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has indeed proposed a peace plan at the G20 summit that includes freezing the conflict along the current frontlines. This plan involves several key points, such as freezing hostilities at the current positions, creating a demilitarized zone in eastern Ukraine, and postponing discussions about Ukraine's NATO membership for at least 10 years[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any peace proposal been officially accepted by both Ukraine and Russia in the last three months?\nANSWER: No, there has been no peace proposal officially accepted by both Ukraine and Russia in the last three months. The sources indicate ongoing negotiations and various proposals, but none of these have been accepted by both parties. The talks have been marked by significant disagreements and unresolved issues, such as Russia's demands for territory and Ukraine's refusal to recognize Russian annexations[2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the incoming Trump administration actively engaged in mediating peace talks between Ukraine and Russia?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration is actively engaged in mediating peace talks between Ukraine and Russia at the moment.\n\nWhile the sources indicate that President-elect Donald Trump has spoken to both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and there are plans to ramp up pressure on both sides to come to a truce agreement, there is no specific information that the Trump administration is currently actively mediating peace talks[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Ukraine's \"victory plan\" include conditions that are acceptable to Russia for a ceasefire?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nUkraine's \"victory plan\" and its associated peace terms are not aligned with Russia's conditions for a ceasefire. Ukraine's plan includes demands such as the full withdrawal of Russian military forces from Ukraine, prosecution of war crimes, and security guarantees, which are not acceptable to Russia[2][3].\n\nIn contrast, Russia's terms for a ceasefire include demands that Russia be allowed to keep all the land it occupies, be handed all the provinces it claims but does not fully control, and that Ukraine officially end its plans to join NATO[2]. These conditions are fundamentally at odds with Ukraine's proposals.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any significant reduction in active combat operations between Ukraine and Russia since November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of a significant reduction in active combat operations between Ukraine and Russia since November 2024. Here are some key points:\n\n- Russian forces continue to conduct ground attacks and airstrikes in various regions, including near Kharkiv City, Luhansk Oblast, and other areas[1][4].\n- There have been recent advances and ongoing combat activities in several directions, such as Kupyansk, Vuhledar, and the Siversk direction[1][4].\n- The sources also mention ongoing missile and drone strikes, including significant damage to Ukrainian energy infrastructure and continued civilian casualties[1][2][4].\n\nThese points suggest that active combat operations have not diminished significantly since November 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have peace initiatives proposed by Brazil or China been endorsed by both Ukraine and Russia?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe peace initiatives proposed by Brazil and China have not been endorsed by both Ukraine and Russia. Here are the key points:\n\n- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has criticized the China-Brazil peace proposal, calling it \"destructive\" and accusing Brazil of being pro-Russia. He rejected the proposal because it did not involve Russia withdrawing its forces from Ukrainian territory[3][4][5].\n\n- Russia's terms for peace, as outlined by Putin, include demands that Ukraine recognize Russian-occupied territories and end plans to join NATO, which are not aligned with the Chinese-Brazilian proposal's focus on deescalation and humanitarian assistance without addressing these specific demands[2].\n\n- The Chinese-Brazilian proposal has been supported by some countries from the Global South, but it has not gained the endorsement of either Ukraine or Russia in the terms they have set for peace negotiations[4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Ukraine and Russia both publicly expressed a willingness to negotiate a comprehensive bilateral ceasefire?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that Russia's stance on negotiations is not indicative of a genuine willingness for a comprehensive bilateral ceasefire.\n\n- Russia's demands, as outlined in the sources, are highly one-sided and insist on Ukraine's capitulation, including territorial concessions, demilitarization, and other conditions that would leave Ukraine defenseless and isolated[1][2][3].\n- Russian officials, including Putin and other affiliated figures, have continued to insist on maximalist objectives that do not suggest a willingness for compromise or a genuine ceasefire[2][3].\n\nOn the other hand, Ukraine has expressed a desire for robust security guarantees and mechanisms to deter future Russian aggression, but there is no indication that Ukraine has agreed to the terms proposed by Russia[4].\n\nTherefore, while Ukraine may be open to negotiations under different terms, Russia has not publicly expressed a willingness to negotiate a comprehensive bilateral ceasefire on equitable terms.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Russian military casualties in the Ukraine war exceeded 710,000 troops as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the estimates of Russian military casualties in the Ukraine war are as follows:\n\n- One source estimates that Russia has lost around 725,000 personnel (killed and wounded) as of November 2024[1].\n- Another source mentions that the total Russian deaths at war, as of July 2024, were estimated at over 120,000, but this does not include the total number of wounded. However, it also notes that the overall casualties, including both killed and wounded, are significantly higher[2].\n- A third source reports high daily casualty rates, with estimates of around 1,200-1,345 casualties per day in September and October 2024, but it does not provide a cumulative total that exceeds 710,000[4].\n\nGiven the first source explicitly mentions that Russian casualties have reached approximately 725,000, which is above the 710,000 threshold, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are key NATO member countries reducing or reconsidering their military support for Ukraine?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that key NATO member countries are reducing or reconsidering their military support for Ukraine. Here are some key points:\n\n- The United States has continued to provide significant military assistance, with total funding standing at $50.9 billion since the start of the Biden administration, and additional packages announced in 2024[3][4].\n- Other key NATO members like the UK, Germany, and others have also maintained or increased their military support. For example, the UK has pledged £7.6 billion for military assistance since February 2022, with £3 billion allocated for 2024/25[3].\n- The European Union has also committed substantial funds through its European Peace Facility, with €11.1 billion dedicated to military support for Ukraine, including a dedicated Ukraine Assistance Fund agreed in March 2024[3].\n- There are ongoing efforts to coordinate and enhance military assistance, such as the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meetings and NATO's role in coordinating requests for assistance from the Ukrainian government[3][4].\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that key NATO member countries are not reducing or reconsidering their military support for Ukraine.\n\n**NO**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\nApproximately 6 weeks remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\nIf the current situation persists with ongoing active combat, entrenched positions, and no significant breakthroughs in negotiations, the likely outcome would be **No**—a bilateral ceasefire would not be announced before January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\nWith roughly 1.5 weeks remaining, the probability of a bilateral ceasefire being announced would decrease significantly, estimated at around **5%**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\nIf there were approximately 24 weeks until the deadline, the probability might increase to around **15%** due to the extended timeframe allowing for potential diplomatic efforts and changes in the conflict's dynamics.\n\n**Rationale:**\nAs of November 19, 2024, there are approximately six weeks remaining until the January 1, 2025, deadline for a bilateral ceasefire announcement in the Ukraine war. The current state of negotiations is fraught with significant obstacles:\n\n1. **Entrenched Positions:** Both Ukraine and Russia maintain rigid stances with uncompromising demands. Ukraine's insistence on full territorial integrity and potential NATO membership contrasts sharply with Russia's demands for territorial concessions and limitations on Ukraine's alliances.\n\n2. **Ongoing Combat Operations:** Active and intensified military engagements, including the reported introduction of North Korean troops and substantial Russian casualties exceeding 710,000, indicate a high level of commitment to the conflict from both sides. This sustained combat activity reduces the immediate likelihood of a ceasefire.\n\n3. **International Dynamics:** While there are multiple peace proposals from countries like Turkey, Brazil, and China, none have gained sufficient traction or mutual acceptance from both Ukraine and Russia. Additionally, key NATO members continue to support Ukraine militarily, which may deter Russia from seeking a ceasefire under current conditions.\n\n4. **Internal Pressures:** Russia faces internal demographic challenges and significant military losses, which could, in theory, incentivize seeking a ceasefire. However, the lack of alignment between Russian and Ukrainian demands and the absence of a conducive international environment make swift progress unlikely.\n\n5. **Time Constraint:** With only six weeks remaining, the window for meaningful negotiation and agreement is narrow, especially given the current lack of trust and the complexity of the issues at hand.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of a bilateral ceasefire being announced before the deadline remains low. Extending the timeframe slightly increases the chances marginally, but the fundamental challenges and time constraints still pose substantial barriers.\n\n**Probability: 12%**",
