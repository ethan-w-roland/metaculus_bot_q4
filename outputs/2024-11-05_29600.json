    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the USDA-posted recall of Hickory Hollow's ready-to-eat jerky products be closed before December 1, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of Hickory Hollow's beef jerky and bacon jerky products produced on various dates between Jan. 19, 2024-Aug. 21, 2024 is changed from Active to Closed when [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/hickory-hollow-jerky-recalls-ready-eat-jerky-products-produced-without-benefit) is accessed by Metaculus after November 30, 2024.  If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the Alabama Media Group on [September 4, 2024](https://www.al.com/life/2024/09/6229-pounds-of-jerky-from-alabama-company-recalled.html), \"Ready-to-eat jerky products from an Alabama-based company are being recalled. The products were shipped to retail locations in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Oklahoma. The products were also sold on the internet. So far, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products, according to the USDA. Anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the USDA-posted recall of Hickory Hollow's ready-to-eat jerky products will be closed before December 1, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Recall Announcement and Timeline\n- The recall was announced on August 30, 2024, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).\n- The affected products were produced between January 19, 2024, and August 21, 2024, with a change in ownership occurring on June 11, 2024.\n\n## Recall Process and Effectiveness Checks\n- The FSIS conducts recall effectiveness checks to ensure that the recalling firm has notified its customers and that steps are being taken to remove the product from the market.\n- These checks are ongoing, but there is no specified timeline for when the recall will be considered closed.\n\n## Current Status\n- As of the latest information available, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products, and the recall is still listed as \"open\".\n\n## General Recall Closure Criteria\n- A recall is typically considered closed once the FSIS has verified that the recalling firm has taken all necessary steps to ensure the product is removed from the market and consumers have been adequately notified. This process can vary in duration depending on the complexity of the recall and the cooperation of the involved parties.\n\nGiven these points, it is not immediately clear whether the recall will be closed before December 1, 2024. The closure of a recall depends on various factors, including the efficiency of the recall process, consumer response, and the verification by FSIS that all necessary steps have been taken. Without specific information on the current progress of the recall effectiveness checks, it is difficult to predict the exact date of closure.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any reported adverse reactions due to consumption of the recalled Hickory Hollow jerky products?\nANSWER: No, there have been no reported adverse reactions due to the consumption of the recalled Hickory Hollow jerky products. This is consistently stated in multiple sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any public information indicating that the FSIS is close to closing the recall of Hickory Hollow's jerky products?\nANSWER: There is no public information indicating that the FSIS is close to closing the recall of Hickory Hollow's jerky products. The sources provided detail the recall announcement, the reasons for the recall, and the actions consumers should take, but they do not mention any progress or timeline for closing the recall.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of November 5, 2024, is the USDA recall of Hickory Hollow's ready-to-eat jerky products still listed as active on the FSIS website?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is unclear whether the USDA recall of Hickory Hollow's ready-to-eat jerky products is still listed as active on the FSIS website as of November 5, 2024. The sources provided detail the recall and its circumstances but do not specify the current status of the recall as of the given date.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the change in ownership of Hickory Hollow on June 11, 2024, cause delays in the recall process?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the change in ownership of Hickory Hollow Jerky on June 11, 2024, caused delays in the recall process. The sources explain the reason for the recall, which was the production and labeling of jerky products without federal inspection, but they do not mention any delays in the recall process attributed to the change in ownership.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the FSIS completed its recall effectiveness checks for Hickory Hollow's ready-to-eat jerky products?\nANSWER: The sources indicate that the FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks, but they do not specify that these checks have been completed for the specific recall of Hickory Hollow's ready-to-eat jerky products produced without the benefit of federal inspection.\n\n- The sources mention that \"FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is removed from the market\".\n- However, they do not provide a confirmation that these checks have been completed for this particular recall.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any similar USDA recalls of ready-to-eat meat products been closed within three months of their announcement in recent years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit information indicating that any of the recent USDA recalls of ready-to-eat meat products have been closed within three months of their announcement.\n\n- The Boar's Head Provisions Co. recall announced on July 30, 2024, is still ongoing as of the latest update, with no mention of it being closed.\n- The BrucePac recall announced on October 9, 2024, is also ongoing, and there is no indication that it has been closed.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether any similar USDA recalls of ready-to-eat meat products have been closed within three months of their announcement in recent years is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there ongoing legal or regulatory issues affecting the closure of the Hickory Hollow jerky recall?\nANSWER: To determine if there are ongoing legal or regulatory issues affecting the closure of the Hickory Hollow jerky recall, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Recall Notices**: Check if there have been any recall notices issued by regulatory bodies such as the FDA or USDA regarding Hickory Hollow jerky products.\n2. **Legal Actions**: Look for any reports or documents indicating legal actions, such as lawsuits or investigations, related to the recall.\n3. **Regulatory Updates**: Review recent updates from regulatory agencies to see if there are any ongoing issues or unresolved matters related to the recall.\n\nWithout specific and current sources directly addressing these points, it is challenging to provide a definitive answer.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information in the provided context, the answer would be:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Hickory Hollow complied with all FSIS requirements necessary for closing the recall of their jerky products?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is unclear whether Hickory Hollow Jerky has fully complied with all the FSIS requirements necessary for closing the recall of their jerky products.\n\nThe sources indicate that the recall was initiated due to the products being produced without the required federal inspection, and the FSIS is conducting recall effectiveness checks to ensure the products are removed from the market and consumers are notified.\n\nHowever, there is no specific information in the sources provided that confirms Hickory Hollow Jerky has completed all the necessary steps to close the recall, such as confirming that all affected products have been removed from the market, that all customers have been notified, and that any other FSIS requirements have been met.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the FSIS typically close recalls of this nature within 90 days of the recall announcement?\nANSWER: The FSIS does not necessarily close recalls within 90 days of the recall announcement. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- A recall is considered closed when the firm sends FSIS a closeout memo with details such as the list of customers, the amount of product retrieved, actions taken, and the disposition of returned product. FSIS then issues a closeout letter to the firm and moves the recall from the Current Recalls and Alerts page to the Recall Case Archive.\n- There is no specific timeframe mentioned in the sources for the closure of a recall, only the steps and procedures that need to be completed for a recall to be considered closed.\n- However, some administrative processes, such as reimbursement for costs incurred during the recall, may involve a 90-day timeline, but this does not necessarily mean the recall itself is closed within that timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any factors unique to the Hickory Hollow jerky recall that could delay its closure beyond December 1, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, there are several factors that could potentially complicate or delay the closure of the Hickory Hollow jerky recall beyond December 1, 2024, although they may not necessarily guarantee a delay:\n\n## Multiple Ownership Involved\nThe recall involves products produced by two different owners of the establishment, with the ownership change occurring on June 11, 2024. This could add complexity to the recall process, as both the current and previous owners need to be involved in notifying customers and ensuring the products are removed from the market.\n\n## Wide Distribution\nThe products were distributed to multiple states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma) and were also sold online, which can make it more challenging to track and retrieve all the affected products.\n\n## Consumer Action Required\nConsumers need to search their homes for the recalled products and either discard them or return them to the point of purchase. Ensuring that all consumers are aware of and comply with this instruction can be time-consuming and may extend the recall process.\n\n## FSIS Recall Effectiveness Checks\nThe FSIS conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that the recalling firm has notified its customers and taken steps to remove the product from the market. These checks can take time and may need to be repeated to ensure compliance, potentially extending the recall period.\n\nWhile these factors do not definitively indicate that the recall will be delayed beyond December 1, 2024, they do introduce complexities that could contribute to a longer recall process.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known is **25 days**, from November 5, 2024, to December 1, 2024.\n\n(b) If nothing changed between now and December 1, 2024, the recall would remain **Active**, and the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n(c) If there were only a quarter of the time left (approximately **6 days**), I would forecast a **lower probability** that the recall will be closed before December 1, 2024.\n\n(d) If there were four times the time left (approximately **100 days**), I would forecast a **higher probability** that the recall will be closed before December 1, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe recall of Hickory Hollow's ready-to-eat jerky products was announced by the FSIS on August 30, 2024. As of November 5, 2024, there is no public information indicating that the recall has been closed or that the FSIS is close to closing it. The typical duration of FSIS recalls can vary widely, and there is no standard timeframe for when a recall is closed.\n\nSeveral factors may influence the likelihood of the recall being closed before December 1, 2024:\n\n- **Time Elapsed Since Recall Announcement:** Approximately two months have passed since the recall was announced. While some recalls may close within this timeframe, others may remain open longer, especially if there are complexities involved.\n  \n- **Change in Ownership:** The change in ownership of Hickory Hollow on June 11, 2024, could introduce complexities in the recall process, potentially delaying compliance and closure.\n  \n- **Distribution Scope:** The recalled products were distributed across multiple states and sold online, which can complicate the process of notifying all customers and retrieving all affected products.\n  \n- **No Reported Adverse Reactions:** The absence of reported adverse reactions may reduce the urgency from a regulatory standpoint, possibly leading to a longer timeframe before closure.\n\n- **Lack of Public Updates:** There is no public information indicating progress toward closing the recall, such as completion of recall effectiveness checks or compliance with FSIS requirements.\n\nGiven the limited time remaining and the lack of evidence suggesting imminent closure, it seems **unlikely** that the recall will be closed before December 1, 2024. However, it is still **possible** that the necessary steps could be completed within the next 25 days if the company has been actively working toward resolving the recall.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
