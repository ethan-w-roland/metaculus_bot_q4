    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nOn December 31, 2024, will exactly 4 US states have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-07\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as the number of US states, including Washington, D.C., in which fully rider-only ride-hailing trips operated by Waymo are available to the general public on December 31.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be Waymo's website, which as of November 6, 2024 includes a [\"Where Can You Go?\"](https://waymo.com/whereyoucango/) page. Other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) may also be considered in the event of ambiguity or dispute.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- \"rider-only\" trip means one in which the only humans in the car are passengers and no human operates the vehicle for the duration of the trip.\n- \"Available to the general public\" means that any member of the public is eligible to use the service without first joining a waitlist or having been granted use of the service as part of a limited testing or early access phase.\n- \"United States\" means the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. Therefore the possible outcome range is 0-51.\n- In the event that Waymo's operating status in a given state is ambiguous or disputed, Metaculus admins will resolve the state's status based on the best available information indicating whether, in fact, its autonomous ride-hailing service is publicly available for ride-hailing on December 3 1, 2024.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThis question is part of the [Understanding AI Series with Timothy B Lee](https://www.metaculus.com/project/3055/) and was inspired by [this post](https://www.understandingai.org/p/new-data-shows-waymo-crashes-a-lot).\n\nWaymo, the Alphabet-owned self-driving technology company, has emerged as a pioneer in the development of autonomous vehicles. Since its inception as Google’s self-driving car project in 2009, Waymo’s vehicles have logged over 7 million miles of rider-only trips.\n\nAs of early 2024, Waymo operates its rider-only ride-hailing service in California (San Francisco and Los Angeles) and Arizona (Phoenix), and has announced plans to expand operations to Texas (Austin).\n\nIn late 2023, Waymo published a [report](https://waymo.com/blog/2023/12/waymo-significantly-outperforms-comparable-human-benchmarks-over-7-million/) claiming that its autonomous vehicles have achieved an 85% reduction in the rate of injury-causing compared to national rates for human-operated cars, highlighting the potential of self-driving cars to reduce crashes caused by human error.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether exactly 4 US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public by December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Operational States\nAs of now, Waymo's autonomous ride-hailing service, Waymo One, is operational in the following states:\n- California (specifically in San Francisco and Los Angeles)\n- Arizona (primarily in Phoenix)\n- Texas (in Austin)\n\n## Planned Expansions\nWaymo has been expanding its services gradually. While there are discussions about potential expansions to other states like Nevada and Florida, these plans are not yet confirmed for implementation by the end of 2024.\n\n## Expansion Pace\nWaymo's expansion has been cautious and gradual, with a focus on ensuring safety and regulatory compliance. The company typically takes around 18 months to open a new city, which suggests that significant new state expansions might not be imminent by the end of 2024.\n\n## Current Status\nAs of the latest updates, Waymo operates in three states (California, Arizona, and Texas) and has not officially announced the launch of its rider-only service in any additional states by the end of 2024.\n\nGiven this information, it is unlikely that exactly 4 US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public by December 31, 2024, unless there are unannounced or very recent developments that have not been publicly disclosed.\n\n### Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- Waymo's expansion rate is slow and methodical, focusing on safety and regulatory compliance.\n- The company has a history of gradual expansion, which suggests that adding a new state by the end of 2024 would be an accelerated pace compared to their current trajectory.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Other autonomous vehicle companies, like General Motors' Cruise, have faced regulatory hurdles and incidents that have slowed their expansion, which might serve as a reference for the challenges and pace of expansion in this field.\n\nIn summary, based on the current information, it is not clear that Waymo will expand to exactly 4 states by December 31, 2024, and the likelihood seems low given their historical expansion pace.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service currently available to the general public in Texas?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nAs of the latest updates, Waymo's fully autonomous ride-hailing service, Waymo One, is now available to the general public in Austin, Texas. Previously, the service was only available to Waymo employees, but it has recently been opened to members of the public.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service currently available to the general public in Arizona?\nANSWER: YES\n\nWaymo's rider-only ride-hailing service is currently available to the general public in Arizona. The service, known as Waymo One, has been expanded to cover a significant area in Metro Phoenix, including various cities such as Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Chandler, and Mesa. The service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and includes access to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any indications that Waymo will launch rider-only ride-hailing services in a fourth US state before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no indications that Waymo will launch rider-only ride-hailing services in a fourth US state before December 31, 2024. The sources mention expansions and testing in cities within the states of California, Arizona, and Texas, but they do not mention any plans for launching services in a new state beyond these areas.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service currently available to the general public in California?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nWaymo's rider-only ride-hailing service is currently available to the general public in California. As of June 2024, Waymo One is open to everyone in San Francisco, allowing anyone to hail a ride using the app.\n\nAdditionally, Waymo has expanded its service to include other areas in the San Francisco Bay Area, such as Daly City, Broadmoor, and Colma, and has also launched commercial operations in Los Angeles.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of Waymo conducting advanced testing or pilot programs in a new US state that could lead to public availability before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific evidence of Waymo conducting advanced testing or pilot programs in a new US state that would lead to public availability before December 31, 2024, beyond the cities and states already mentioned.\n\nThe sources mention ongoing and planned expansions in cities like Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix, and San Francisco, which are all in states where Waymo is already active (California, Texas, and Arizona).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Waymo historically expanded its rider-only ride-hailing service to new US states within a two-month timeframe?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no evidence to suggest that Waymo has historically expanded its rider-only ride-hailing service to new US states within a two-month timeframe.\n\n- The expansions mentioned in the sources, such as the recent expansions in Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin, have been gradual and often involve extensive testing and evaluation periods before the service is made available to the public.\n- The process of expanding to new cities, let alone new states, involves significant preparation, testing, and regulatory approvals, which typically take longer than two months.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any regulatory approvals pending that would enable Waymo to operate rider-only ride-hailing services in new US states before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of regulatory approvals pending for Waymo to operate in new US states beyond those already approved (California, Arizona) before December 31, 2024. The sources discuss the recent approvals for operating in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as plans for expansion to cities like Austin, Texas, but they do not mention any pending regulatory approvals for new states.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as the sources do not provide information on pending approvals for new states.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Waymo officially announced plans to expand its rider-only ride-hailing service to any additional US states before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no official announcement from Waymo regarding the expansion of its rider-only ride-hailing service to additional US states beyond those already mentioned (California, Arizona, Texas, and potentially others like Nevada and Florida) before December 31, 2024.\n\n- The sources mention current and planned expansions within existing states, such as in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and the introduction of services in Atlanta, but these are either within states where Waymo is already operating or do not specify new states beyond the current ones.\n- There are discussions and speculations about future expansions, but no concrete official announcement for new states before the end of 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any US states recently passed legislation favorable to autonomous vehicle operations that could facilitate Waymo's expansion?\nANSWER: Yes, several US states have recently passed or updated legislation that is favorable to autonomous vehicle operations, which could facilitate the expansion of companies like Waymo.\n\n- In 2024, Kentucky became the 25th state to have an AV deployment statute, marking a significant milestone in supporting autonomous vehicle advancement.\n- States such as Arizona, Florida, and Texas have enacted laws that permit the deployment of autonomous vehicles, including those without a human operator, under certain conditions. These laws often include requirements for safety features, liability insurance, and compliance with traffic laws.\n- Nevada, a leader in autonomous vehicle deployment, continues to support the industry with favorable regulations, including allowing companies like Zoox to expand their operations in the state.\n- Other states like Michigan and Tennessee have also loosened their regulations to allow for more extensive testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles.\n\nThese legislative actions create a more supportive regulatory environment for companies like Waymo to expand their autonomous vehicle operations.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Waymo facing significant operational or legal challenges that might delay expansion to additional US states before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Waymo is indeed facing several operational and legal challenges that could potentially delay or complicate its expansion to additional US states before December 31, 2024.\n\n### Operational Challenges\n- Waymo has been involved in various incidents, including collisions and other safety concerns. For example, there have been at least 192 collisions involving Waymo vehicles since 2020, and recent incidents such as a passenger being locked in a vandalized robotaxi and issues with vehicles honking at each other in a parking lot.\n- The company is still refining its technology, particularly in complex urban environments and various weather conditions, which could slow down expansion.\n\n### Legal and Regulatory Challenges\n- Waymo is under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for incidents related to potential crashes, property damage, and collisions with \"clearly visible\" objects. This investigation is still in its preliminary stage, and the outcome could impact Waymo's operations.\n- Regulatory concerns and the need to persuade regulators that autonomous cars can operate safely in complex environments, such as airports, are also significant hurdles.\n\nGiven these challenges, while Waymo has secured significant funding to expand its services, the operational and regulatory issues could delay or slow down its expansion plans to additional US states before the end of 2024.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately **54 days** remain until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf nothing changes, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service will be available to the general public in exactly **three** US states: California, Arizona, and Texas. Therefore, the question would resolve as **False**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith only about **13 days** remaining, the likelihood of Waymo launching its service in a new state and making it available to the general public is extremely low. The forecasted probability would decrease further.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nWith approximately **216 days** (about 7 months) left, the probability of Waymo expanding to a fourth state increases slightly. However, given Waymo's typical expansion timeline of around 18 months per new city or state, the likelihood remains modest.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nWaymo currently operates its rider-only ride-hailing service in **three** US states: California, Arizona, and Texas. As of November 7, 2024, there are no official announcements or credible reports indicating that Waymo plans to expand its service to a fourth state before December 31, 2024.\n\n**Expansion Pace:**\n\n- **Historical Expansion Rate:** Waymo's expansion has been cautious and deliberate, typically taking around **18 months** to launch in a new city or state. This timeline includes safety testing, regulatory approvals, and infrastructure setup.\n- **Time Constraints:** With only **54 days** remaining, it is unlikely that Waymo could complete the necessary steps to launch in a new state and make the service available to the general public.\n\n**Regulatory and Operational Challenges:**\n\n- **Regulatory Approvals:** Expanding to a new state requires navigating complex regulatory environments, obtaining approvals, and ensuring compliance with local laws—all of which are time-consuming processes.\n- **Operational Readiness:** Waymo must ensure its autonomous vehicles can safely operate in new environments, which involves extensive mapping, testing, and staff training.\n\n**Potential for Surprise Announcements:**\n\n- While companies occasionally make unexpected announcements, there are no indications from credible sources that Waymo is on the verge of such an expansion.\n- **Legislative Changes:** Although some states have recently enacted favorable legislation for autonomous vehicles, there's no evidence that Waymo is poised to take immediate advantage of these changes before the year's end.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the above factors, the probability that exactly **four** US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public by December 31, 2024, is **very low**. The lack of publicized expansion plans, combined with the short time frame and historical expansion patterns, suggest that no additional states will be added before the deadline.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
