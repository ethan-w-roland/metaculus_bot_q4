    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Robinhood officially announce it is launching a stablecoin, before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before January 1, 2025, Robinhood Markets, Inc., announces at its blog, which can be accessed through [this link](https://newsroom.aboutrobinhood.com/), that it is launching its own stablecoin. If there is no such announcement posted at that link before January 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nRobinhood's blog will be the sole source used for resolution of this question, regardless of information from other sources. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [Bloomberg](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-revolut-explore-joining-170-170622285.html), \"Companies from Robinhood Markets Inc. to Revolut Ltd. are considering launching stablecoins, betting that stricter regulations in Europe and elsewhere will finally loosen Tether Holdings Ltd.’s grip on the rapidly expanding $170 billion digital-asset sector.... A Robinhood spokesperson said it has “no imminent plans to launch this offering.”\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the provided information, it is clear that Robinhood, along with other companies such as Kraken, Galaxy Digital, and Paxos, has already been involved in the launch of a new stablecoin called USDG (Global Dollar) as part of the Global Dollar Network.\n\n- The USDG stablecoin was launched on November 1, 2024, and the Global Dollar Network was announced on November 4 and 5, 2024.\n- This initiative includes several major financial technology and cryptocurrency companies, and it is designed to promote the global adoption of the USDG stablecoin.\n\nGiven this information, Robinhood has already been a part of the announcement and launch of the USDG stablecoin, which means they have effectively made their involvement in this stablecoin public.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Robinhood will officially announce it is launching a stablecoin before January 1, 2025, is **no**, because the announcement has already been made.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Robinhood participated in the launch of the USDG (Global Dollar) stablecoin?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nRobinhood has participated in the launch of the USDG (Global Dollar) stablecoin as part of the Global Dollar Network, which includes other major fintech and cryptocurrency firms like Kraken, Paxos, and Galaxy Digital.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Robinhood Markets, Inc. officially announced plans to launch its own stablecoin after November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that Robinhood, along with other companies like Kraken and Paxos, has announced plans to launch a new stablecoin called USDG as part of the Global Dollar Network, but this announcement was made on or around November 4-5, 2024. There is no mention of any plans for Robinhood to launch its own separate stablecoin after this date.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the USDG stablecoin considered to be Robinhood's own stablecoin?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe USDG stablecoin is not considered to be Robinhood's own stablecoin. It is a stablecoin issued by Paxos as part of the Global Dollar Network, a collaborative initiative that includes several partners such as Robinhood, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, and others. Robinhood is one of the partners in this network, but it does not issue the USDG stablecoin itself.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have other companies similar to Robinhood announced their own stablecoins recently?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of other companies similar to Robinhood announcing their own stablecoins recently, aside from the collaborative effort involving Robinhood, Kraken, and other companies to launch the USDG stablecoin.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as the sources do not provide information about other similar companies launching their own stablecoins.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Robinhood previously denied plans to launch its own stablecoin?\nANSWER: Yes, Robinhood has previously denied plans to launch its own stablecoin.\n\n- Robinhood's Vice President and General Manager of Robinhood Crypto, Johann Kerbrat, stated that the company has \"no immediate plans to launch a stablecoin\" and they are not spending time on this issue.\n- The company has clarified that it has no intention to join the stablecoin sector in the near future.\n- Despite some speculation and rumors, Robinhood has consistently denied any imminent plans for issuing a stablecoin.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any indication that Robinhood will make significant announcements on its blog before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific indication that Robinhood will make significant announcements on its blog before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss recent and upcoming initiatives, such as the launch of presidential election event contracts and other product expansions, but they do not provide information about future announcements beyond these already disclosed plans.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Robinhood have any ongoing projects that suggest it may launch its own stablecoin?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nRobinhood is involved in an ongoing project to launch a new stablecoin called USDG (Global Dollar) as part of the Global Dollar Network. This initiative is a collaboration with other major cryptocurrency firms, including Kraken, Paxos, and Galaxy Digital. The stablecoin, USDG, is issued by Paxos and is designed to challenge the current stablecoin market dominated by Tether and USD Coin.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Robinhood announced its involvement with USDG on its official blog?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of Robinhood announcing its involvement with USDG on its official blog. The sources detail the launch and partnership involving Robinhood, but they do not specify that the announcement was made on Robinhood's official blog.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an announcement on Robinhood's official blog stating that it is launching its own stablecoin as of November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Robinhood has made an announcement on its official blog about launching its own stablecoin as of November 5, 2024. The sources mention that Robinhood, along with other companies like Kraken and Paxos, has launched the Global Dollar Network and a new stablecoin called USDG, but they do not specify that the announcement was made on Robinhood's official blog.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been regulatory changes that could influence Robinhood to launch a stablecoin before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been regulatory changes and upcoming regulations that could influence Robinhood to consider launching a stablecoin before January 1, 2025.\n\n- The European Union's Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations, set to be fully adopted by the end of 2024, impose stringent requirements on stablecoin issuers, including the need for electronic money licenses and specific reserve requirements. These regulations could create an opportunity for new players like Robinhood to enter the market as existing dominant players like Tether face compliance challenges.\n\n- The implementation of these regulations is expected to reshape the stablecoin landscape, potentially loosening Tether's grip on the market and creating space for other fintech companies, including Robinhood and Revolut, to launch their own stablecoins.\n\n- Additionally, the recent announcement of the Global Dollar Network, involving Robinhood, Kraken, and Paxos, indicates active steps towards advancing stablecoin usage in a compliant manner, further suggesting that regulatory changes are influencing their strategies.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 56 days remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **If nothing changed, the outcome would be:** **No**—Robinhood has not announced on its official blog that it is launching its own stablecoin.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 14 days):** Lower probability; estimate around **5%** chance of announcement within that shorter timeframe.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left (approximately 224 days):** Higher probability; estimate around **20%** chance of announcement with more time for developments.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 5, 2024, Robinhood has not announced on its official blog that it is launching its own stablecoin. The resolution criteria specify that only announcements made on Robinhood's official blog will be considered, regardless of information from other sources.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n- **Participation in USDG Stablecoin:** Robinhood is part of the Global Dollar Network, which launched the USDG (Global Dollar) stablecoin. However, USDG is issued by Paxos and is a collaborative effort among multiple companies, including Robinhood, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital. It is not considered Robinhood's own stablecoin.\n- **No Official Blog Announcement:** There is no announcement on Robinhood's official blog regarding the launch of its own stablecoin as of the current date.\n- **Previous Denials:** Robinhood has previously stated that it has \"no imminent plans to launch this offering,\" indicating a lack of intention to create its own stablecoin in the near future.\n\n**Factors Influencing Probability:**\n\n- **Regulatory Environment:** Upcoming regulations like the European Union's Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) could create opportunities for new stablecoin offerings. These regulations may incentivize companies like Robinhood to consider launching their own compliant stablecoins.\n- **Market Competition:** The stablecoin market is expanding, and competitors may prompt Robinhood to introduce new products to remain competitive.\n- **Time Constraints:** With only 56 days remaining, the window for Robinhood to develop, obtain regulatory approval, and announce a new stablecoin is limited.\n\n**Adjusting for Different Timeframes:**\n\n- **Quarter of the Time Left (14 days):** The probability decreases due to the minimal time available for such a significant development and announcement. There would be insufficient time for necessary preparations and regulatory approvals.\n- **Four Times the Time Left (224 days):** The probability increases as there is more time for Robinhood to respond to regulatory changes and market pressures. This extended period allows for product development, compliance checks, and strategic planning.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the lack of an official announcement, previous denials from the company, and the limited time remaining, it is unlikely that Robinhood will announce the launch of its own stablecoin on its official blog before January 1, 2025. However, the possibility is not zero due to potential regulatory shifts and market dynamics that could prompt a change in strategy.\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
