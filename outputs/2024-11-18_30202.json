    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the CDC confirm a case of Marburg virus disease in a US resident before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-18\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publicly confirms at least one case of Marburg virus disease in a resident of the United States before January 1, 2025. The confirmation must be made through an official CDC announcement, such as a press release, health alert, or update on their website. The question resolves as **No** if the CDC does not confirm any cases of Marburg virus disease in U.S. residents before Midnight UTC on January 1, 2025.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- Confirmation is required; CDC's mere acknowledgment of a case being reported, such as from a state department of health, will not count. Suspected or probable cases will not count. Only cases meeting the [CDC's confirmed case definition](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/clinicians/case-definition.html#confirmed) for mpox will be considered. Imported cases count, as long as the infected person is a U.S. resident and physically present within the 50 states at the time of confirmation. For this question, a U.S. resident is defined as any member of the U.S. resident population per the [CDC's definition](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus/sources-definitions/population.htm).\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to CDC, \"The Republic of Rwanda has confirmed several cases of Marburg virus disease (Marburg) in hospitals around the country, including some deaths. This is the country's first Marburg virus outbreak.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the CDC confirming a case of Marburg virus disease (MVD) in a US resident before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Outbreak Status\nAs of the latest reports, there have been no confirmed cases of MVD outside of Rwanda. The outbreak in Rwanda has resulted in several confirmed cases and deaths, primarily among healthcare workers, but no cases have been reported in the United States or other countries[1][3][4].\n\n## Risk Assessment\nThe CDC has indicated that the risk of MVD in the United States is currently low. This assessment is based on the absence of confirmed cases outside Rwanda and the implementation of various preventive measures[1][3][4].\n\n## Preventive Measures\nTo reduce the risk of importing and spreading MVD, the CDC has initiated several measures:\n- Enhanced public health entry screening for travelers arriving from Rwanda at specific U.S. airports, starting October 16, 2024[5].\n- Issuance of a Level 3 Travel Health Notice advising against nonessential travel to Rwanda[2][3].\n- Automated texts and health questionnaires for travelers from Rwanda to monitor for symptoms and potential exposure[5].\n\n## Diagnostic and Response Protocols\nThe CDC has detailed protocols for identifying, isolating, and testing individuals suspected of having MVD. These include immediate reporting of suspected cases, isolation of patients until test results are confirmed, and coordination with state and local health departments for further action[1][3][5].\n\n## Time Frame\nGiven that the screening and monitoring protocols have been in place since mid-October 2024, and considering the incubation period of MVD (2-21 days), there is still a window of time before January 1, 2025, during which a case could potentially be identified. However, the current absence of cases and the stringent measures in place suggest a low likelihood.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\nHistorically, outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers like MVD and Ebola have been rare and typically contained within the region of origin, especially with prompt public health responses. The base rate of such diseases spreading internationally is low, but not zero.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is impossible to rule out the possibility entirely, the current data and preventive measures suggest that the likelihood of the CDC confirming a case of MVD in a US resident before January 1, 2025, is low. However, this cannot be answered with a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" without ongoing surveillance and updates.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the CDC confirmed any cases of Marburg virus disease in the United States as of November 18, 2024?\nANSWER: NO, the CDC has not confirmed any cases of Marburg virus disease in the United States as of November 18, 2024. This is clearly stated in multiple sources, including the CDC's situation summary and risk assessment reports[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any cases of Marburg virus disease been reported in countries outside of Rwanda since the outbreak began?\nANSWER: No cases of Marburg virus disease have been reported in countries outside of Rwanda since the outbreak began. The sources consistently indicate that the outbreak is confined to Rwanda, with no mentions of cases in other countries[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any reports of Marburg virus disease spreading to countries neighboring Rwanda?\nANSWER: There are no reports in the provided sources indicating that the Marburg virus disease has spread to countries neighboring Rwanda. The sources focus on the outbreak within Rwanda, the response measures, and the epidemiological details, but they do not mention any cases or spread of the disease to neighboring countries such as Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or others[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the World Health Organization declared the Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda a Public Health Emergency of International Concern?\nANSWER: No, the World Health Organization (WHO) has not declared the Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). While the WHO has classified the outbreak as a grade 3 emergency, the highest internal level for emergencies based on the WHO Emergency Response Framework, and has assessed the risk as very high at the national level and high at the regional level, there is no indication that it has been declared a PHEIC[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant numbers of travelers entering the United States from Rwanda between now and January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or information regarding the number of travelers entering the United States from Rwanda between now and January 1, 2025.\n\n- The sources discuss Rwanda's economic and political situation, its exports to the United States, and global tourism trends, but they do not provide specific statistics on travel from Rwanda to the United States[1][2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the CDC issued any recent alerts or updates indicating an increased risk of Marburg virus disease in the United States?\nANSWER: No, the CDC has not issued any recent alerts or updates indicating an increased risk of Marburg virus disease in the United States. All the sources indicate that the risk of Marburg virus disease in the United States is currently low, and there have been no reported cases of Marburg in the country[1][3][4].\n\nHowever, the CDC has issued health advisories and alerts to inform healthcare providers and the public about the outbreak in Rwanda, to raise awareness, and to provide guidance on managing potential cases and screening travelers from affected areas[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any suspected cases of Marburg virus disease under investigation by health authorities in the United States?\nANSWER: As of the latest information available, there are no confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) in the United States, and there is no mention of suspected cases under investigation in the provided sources.\n\n- The CDC has stated that \"No confirmed cases of MVD related to this outbreak have been reported in the United States or other countries outside of the Republic of Rwanda\"[4][5].\n- There is no indication in the sources that any suspected cases are currently under investigation in the U.S.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda currently increasing in the number of cases or geographic spread?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that the Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda is not currently increasing in the number of cases or geographic spread. Here are the key points:\n\n- As of 8 November 2024, Rwanda has reported no new confirmed cases since 30 October 2024[1][2][5].\n- The last patient was discharged on 8 November 2024, and a 42-day countdown to declare the end of the outbreak has begun[1][2].\n- There has been no community transmission reported to date, and the cases have been primarily confined to health workers in two health facilities in Kigali[1][2][5].\n\nThese points suggest that the outbreak is under control and not increasing in terms of case numbers or geographic spread.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Marburg virus disease ever been confirmed in a U.S. resident in previous outbreaks?\nANSWER: Yes, Marburg virus disease has been confirmed in a U.S. resident in previous outbreaks, although these cases were typically associated with travel to or work in areas where the virus is endemic.\n\n- A U.S. traveler returned from Uganda in January 2008 and developed illness, but was hospitalized, discharged, and fully recovered after being diagnosed with Marburg virus infection[2].\n- There was also a case of a U.S. healthcare worker who was part of a medical evacuation from another country, but this did not result in community spread within the U.S.[3].\n\nThese instances indicate that while the virus has been introduced to the U.S. through travelers, it has not led to significant outbreaks within the country.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current screening and preventive measures effectively reducing the risk of Marburg virus disease importation into the United States?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, the current screening and preventive measures appear to be designed to reduce the risk of Marburg virus disease importation into the United States, but whether they are effectively doing so is not explicitly confirmed in the sources.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- Enhanced public health entry screening has been implemented for travelers entering the U.S. from Rwanda, focusing on identifying symptoms and potential exposure to the virus[2][3][5].\n- Travelers are being rerouted to specific airports for screening, and those with symptoms or potential exposure are being further assessed and monitored[2][3][5].\n- The measures include temperature checks, health questionnaires, and isolation protocols for those showing symptoms or with a history of exposure[2][3].\n\nWhile these measures are taken \"out of an abundance of caution\" and are part of a strategy to prevent imported cases, the sources do not provide specific data or outcomes that definitively prove these measures are effectively reducing the risk of Marburg virus disease importation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nFrom November 18, 2024, to January 1, 2025, there are **43 days** remaining.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf the current situation persists—with no confirmed cases of Marburg virus disease (MVD) in the United States—the outcome would be **No**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **11 days** left until January 1, 2025, I would estimate a **1% probability** of the CDC confirming a case of MVD in a U.S. resident.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **172 days** left (extending the deadline by four times), I would estimate a **5% probability** of a confirmed case.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSeveral factors influence the probability that the CDC will confirm a case of Marburg virus disease in a U.S. resident before January 1, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Outbreak Status in Rwanda:**\n\n   - As of November 18, 2024, Rwanda has reported no new confirmed cases since October 30, 2024.\n   - The last patient was discharged on November 8, 2024, and a 42-day countdown (twice the maximum incubation period) to declare the end of the outbreak has begun.\n   - There is no indication of increasing case numbers or geographic spread within Rwanda or to neighboring countries.\n\n2. **International Spread:**\n\n   - No cases of MVD have been reported outside of Rwanda.\n   - Historically, Marburg outbreaks have been contained regionally, with rare instances of international cases.\n\n3. **Preventive Measures:**\n\n   - The CDC has implemented enhanced screening measures for travelers from Rwanda since October 16, 2024.\n   - Travelers from Rwanda are being funneled to specific U.S. airports for health screenings.\n   - A Level 3 Travel Health Notice advises against nonessential travel to Rwanda.\n   - These measures reduce the likelihood of an undetected case entering the U.S.\n\n4. **Time Frame:**\n\n   - With 43 days remaining, and considering the incubation period of 2-21 days, the window for a traveler to become infected, travel to the U.S., develop symptoms, and be confirmed by the CDC is narrowing.\n   - If the time were reduced to 11 days, the probability diminishes further due to the shorter incubation and travel times required.\n   - Extending the time to 172 days increases the probability slightly, as it allows for unforeseen developments, such as a new outbreak or lapses in containment.\n\n5. **Base Rates and Historical Data:**\n\n   - Past instances of MVD in the U.S. are exceedingly rare. There have been isolated cases associated with travelers or healthcare workers returning from affected areas, but no sustained transmission.\n   - The base rate of MVD cases being imported into the U.S. is extremely low.\n\n6. **Current Risk Assessment:**\n\n   - The CDC assesses the current risk to the U.S. as low.\n   - No suspected cases are under investigation in the U.S.\n   - There are no recent alerts indicating an increased risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the effective containment of the outbreak in Rwanda, the absence of international spread, stringent preventive measures, and the limited time frame, the probability of the CDC confirming a case of Marburg virus disease in a U.S. resident before January 1, 2025, is low but not zero. There remains a minimal chance due to unforeseen factors, such as undetected cases or lapses in containment.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 3%**",
