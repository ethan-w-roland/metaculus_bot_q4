{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) be higher Year-over-Year on October 30, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve based on reporting by the St. Louis Fed at [this link](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VXVCLS). The reported number for October 30, 2024 must be greater than the reported number on October 30, 2023, which at the time of this question was 20.80.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe question will resolve according to the first value published for the period in question. Later updates or revisions will be immaterial.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/VXVCLS): > Chicago Board Options Exchange, CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index [VXVCLS], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIX), VIX is the ticker symbol and the popular name for the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index, a popular measure of the stock market's expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options. It is calculated and disseminated on a real-time basis by the CBOE, and is often referred to as the fear index or fear gauge.\" This question specificially looks at the 3-month version of the Vix.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS) will be higher year-over-year on October 30, 2024, here are some key points and background information that can help in making a prediction:\n\n## Current Levels and Trends\nAs of October 11, 2024, the VXVCLS index is at 20.77, which is up 14.81% from its level of 18.09 one year ago.\n\n## Historical Data\nThe VXVCLS index measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 over the next three months. Historical data shows that this index can fluctuate significantly based on market conditions, economic events, and geopolitical factors.\n\n## Year-over-Year Comparison\nTo determine if the VXVCLS will be higher year-over-year on October 30, 2024, one needs to compare the expected value on that date with the value on October 30, 2023. As of the current data, the index is already higher than its level a year ago, but future market conditions could influence this.\n\n## Market Volatility\nVolatility indices like VXVCLS are highly sensitive to market events, economic indicators, and investor sentiment. Any significant economic news, geopolitical events, or changes in market conditions between now and October 30, 2024, could impact the index's value.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\nHistorically, volatility indices can exhibit high variability. For instance, during periods of economic stress or significant market events, these indices tend to spike. However, in more stable market conditions, they tend to be lower. Understanding these base rates and reference classes can help in predicting future behavior.\n\nGiven the current data and trends, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the VXVCLS will be higher year-over-year on October 30, 2024, without knowing the future market conditions and events that may influence it. The answer depends on various factors that will unfold between now and the specified date.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the VXVCLS index shown an upward trend in the weeks leading up to October 30, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or analysis that details the trend of the VXVCLS index in the weeks leading up to October 30, 2024. The sources provide historical data and general trends up to October 17, 2024, but do not extend to the period immediately leading up to October 30, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Will the U.S. stock market experience a significant downturn between October 21, 2024, and October 30, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information or prediction that indicates a significant downturn in the U.S. stock market between October 21, 2024, and October 30, 2024. The sources discuss historical market crashes, recent market movements, and general market analysis, but they do not provide a forecast for the specific period in question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Reserve implemented any interest rate changes in 2024 that could affect market volatility?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe Federal Reserve has implemented an interest rate change in 2024 that could affect market volatility. In September 2024, the Federal Reserve cut the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4.75%-5%, which was the first reduction in borrowing costs since March 2020.\n\nAdditionally, the Fed has indicated plans for further rate cuts, with projections suggesting another 50 basis points of cuts by the end of 2024 and more cuts in 2025 and 2026, which could also impact market volatility.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current VXVCLS level of 20.77 above its one-year average?\nANSWER: To determine if the current VIX level of 20.77 is above its one-year average, we need to compare it to the average VIX level over the past year.\n\nFrom the data provided in the sources, here are the relevant points:\n\n- The current VIX level as of October 15, 2024, is 20.64, and it has been around similar levels in recent days.\n- The average VIX level for 2024 up to the current date is 15.28.\n\nGiven that the current VIX level of 20.77 is significantly higher than the average VIX level of 15.28 for the year 2024, we can conclude that the current VIX level is indeed above its one-year average.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent increases in the trading volume of S&P 500 index options?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific recent data (as of 2024) that directly indicates an increase in the trading volume of S&P 500 index options. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the relevant information:\n\n- The source from YCharts provides data up to October 17, 2024, but it focuses on the volume of SPX options without comparing recent volumes to previous periods in a way that indicates an increase.\n- The NYSE article discusses market volume trends but does not provide specific recent data on S&P 500 index options trading volume.\n- The Cboe article on the 35 years of S&P 500 index options trading provides historical context and past records but does not include recent data on volume increases as of 2024.\n\nGiven the lack of specific recent data in these sources, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major corporate earnings reports expected in late October 2024 that could affect market volatility?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several major corporate earnings reports expected in late October 2024 that could potentially affect market volatility.\n\nHere are some of the notable companies scheduled to report their earnings during this period:\n\n- **GE Aerospace (GE)**, **Danaher Corporation (DHR)**, **Philip Morris International Inc (PM)**, **Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)**, **RTX Corporation (RTX)**, and **Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT)** are all reporting on October 22, 2024.\n- **3M Company (MMM)** and **PACCAR Inc. (PCAR)** are also reporting on October 22, 2024.\n- Other companies like **Northrop Grumman**, **Dexcom**, **Union Pacific**, **L3Harris Technologies**, and several others are scheduled to report their earnings around the same time frame.\n\nThese reports from significant companies across various industries can influence market sentiment and volatility as investors react to the earnings results and any guidance provided by the companies.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has investor sentiment towards the S&P 500 become more fearful or uncertain in the past month?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication that investor sentiment towards the S&P 500 has become more fearful or uncertain in the past month. Here are the key points:\n\n- The S&P 500 has continued to reach new record highs, with a sixth consecutive week of gains as of October 18, which suggests ongoing optimism rather than fear or uncertainty.\n- The market has been driven by strong earnings reports, particularly from major banks and Netflix, which has maintained a positive tone for the earnings season.\n- Sentiment indicators discussed in the sources, such as the put-call ratio and the AAII survey, do not indicate excessive bullishness or fear. Instead, they suggest a bullish but not euphoric sentiment.\n- While there are mentions of potential risks and uncertainties, such as rising Treasury yields and upcoming earnings reports, these have not yet translated into fearful or uncertain investor sentiment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant economic data releases scheduled for late October 2024 that typically influence the VXVCLS index?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several significant economic data releases scheduled for late October 2024 that could influence financial markets, including those that might impact the VIX or similar volatility indices, although the VIX itself is not directly mentioned.\n\nHere are some key releases:\n\n## Flash PMI Data\n- The October flash PMI data for major developed economies, including the US, UK, Eurozone, Japan, and Australia, will be released on October 24. This data provides early insights into economic conditions and can influence market sentiment and volatility.\n\n## Durable Goods Orders and Existing Home Sales\n- The US will release durable goods orders and existing home sales data, which are important indicators of economic activity and can impact market expectations and volatility.\n\n## Central Bank Activities\n- The Bank of Canada (BoC) will hold its October meeting, with speculation about a potential rate cut. Comments from US Fed officials will also be closely watched, as they can influence interest rate expectations and market volatility.\n\n## Inflation and Other Key Indicators\n- Releases such as Germany's Ifo business climate survey, PPI readings, and eurozone consumer confidence data will provide additional insights into economic conditions and could affect market volatility.\n\nThese data releases can significantly influence market sentiment, interest rates, and overall economic outlook, which in turn can impact volatility indices like the VIX.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Will there be any major geopolitical events in 2024 that could increase market volatility before October 30?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are several indications of potential geopolitical events and uncertainties that could increase market volatility before October 30, 2024:\n\n1. **Upcoming U.S. Election**: The article from Yahoo Finance mentions that the upcoming U.S. election is a source of market uncertainty and volatility, with a particular focus on the potential for a contested election and its implications.\n\n2. **Ongoing Conflicts**: The sources highlight ongoing geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Hamas war, which continue to unsettle global economic stability and could lead to market volatility.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Risks**: S&P Global outlines several geopolitical risks for 2024, including increased tensions between the U.S. and China, energy security concerns, and potential disruptions to global supply chains, all of which could impact market stability.\n\n4. **Economic and Geopolitical Uncertainties**: The ESAs warn of ongoing high economic and geopolitical uncertainties, including the potential for sudden shifts in the economic outlook and market expectations due to various geopolitical events.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that there are several geopolitical events and uncertainties that could increase market volatility before October 30, 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any ongoing global economic issues that could impact the VXVCLS index in October 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several ongoing global economic issues that could potentially impact the VXVCLS index in October 2024:\n\n## Global Growth Slowdown\nGlobal economic growth is expected to slow down in 2024, with forecasts indicating a decline from 3% in 2023 to 2.9% or 3.2% in 2024, depending on the source.\n\n## Inflation and Monetary Policy\nDespite a general trend of moderating inflation, services inflation remains a challenge, and central banks are expected to maintain higher interest rates for longer to ensure price stability. This could affect financial conditions and economic activity.\n\n## Geopolitical Tensions and Trade Disputes\nEscalating trade tensions, the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, and conflicts in the Middle East are contributing to increased uncertainty and risks. These tensions could lead to supply shocks and market disruptions.\n\n## Financial Conditions and Banking Sector\nTightening lending standards, particularly in the commercial real estate sector, and challenges among small and regional banks could reduce lending activity and potentially lead to investor losses, acting as an economic headwind.\n\n## Geoeconomic Fragmentation\nThe pace of geoeconomic fragmentation is expected to accelerate in 2024, which could stoke volatility in the global economy and stock markets. This fragmentation includes the strengthening of geoeconomic blocs and a widening divergence between the Global North and South.\n\n## Labor Markets and Financial Conditions\nWhile labor markets are expected to remain tight, financial conditions are likely to remain restrictive, which could impact economic activity and market performance.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest a complex and uncertain economic environment that could influence the VXVCLS index in October 2024.", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:** 9 days (from October 21, 2024, to October 30, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions remain unchanged, the VXVCLS is expected to stay around its current level of 20.77. Since 20.77 is below the year-over-year threshold of 20.80, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only a quarter of the time left (approximately 2-3 months prior to the event), there is more time for market conditions, economic indicators, and geopolitical events to influence the VXVCLS. Given the additional time for potential volatility triggers, the probability of the VXVCLS exceeding 20.80 would increase.  \n**Forecast Probability:** 55%\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith four times the time left (approximately one year prior to the event), there is significantly more time for various factors to impact market volatility. Economic cycles, policy changes, corporate earnings, and geopolitical developments have a greater window to affect the VXVCLS. Historically, longer time frames allow for more pronounced movements in volatility indices.  \n**Forecast Probability:** 65%\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAs of October 21, 2024, the VXVCLS is at 20.77, very close to the year-over-year threshold of 20.80. Several factors influence the likelihood of the index increasing:\n\n1. **Federal Reserve Policies:** Recent rate cuts by the Federal Reserve may reduce market volatility by easing borrowing costs, potentially lowering the VXVCLS. However, further rate adjustments could introduce uncertainty.\n\n2. **Economic Indicators:** Upcoming releases, such as PMI data and durable goods orders, could impact market sentiment. Positive economic data might reduce volatility, while negative data could increase it.\n\n3. **Corporate Earnings:** Major earnings reports scheduled for late October could lead to significant market movements based on company performances, influencing the VXVCLS.\n\n4. **Geopolitical Events:** Ongoing geopolitical tensions, including the U.S. election, conflicts like Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas, and trade disputes, introduce uncertainty that could elevate market volatility.\n\n5. **Investor Sentiment:** Currently, investor sentiment appears optimistic with the S&P 500 reaching new highs. However, this sentiment can quickly shift based on new information or events.\n\n6. **Historical Trends:** The VXVCLS has shown high variability in response to market stressors. Given that it is already near the threshold, even minor increases in uncertainty or negative events could push it above 20.80.\n\nConsidering the close current level of the VXVCLS to the threshold and the mix of factors that could either stabilize or increase volatility, a slightly above-neutral probability reflects the balanced consideration of these influences.\n\n**Probability: 55%**", "probability": 55}
