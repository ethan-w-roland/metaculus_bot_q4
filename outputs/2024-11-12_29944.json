    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Helldivers 2 win in any of these categories at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-12\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Helldivers 2 wins an award at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards for at least 1 of the following: Best Multiplayer Game, Console Game of the Year, or Best Game Trailer. If this does not occur, this queston resolves as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[All the Golden Joystick Award 2024 Nominees](https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/all-the-golden-joystick-award-nominees-2024)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Helldivers 2 winning in any of the categories at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Nominations\nHelldivers 2 has been nominated in several categories, including:\n- **Console Game of the Year**[1][3][5]\n- **Ultimate Game of the Year**[2][4][5]\n- **Best Multiplayer Game**[1][2][5]\n- **PC Game of the Year** is not explicitly mentioned, but it could be considered under broader categories.\n\n## Competition\nThe competition is fierce, with other highly acclaimed games also nominated. For example:\n- **Console Game of the Year**: Other nominees include Astro Bot, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Dragon’s Dogma 2, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom[1][3][5].\n- **Ultimate Game of the Year**: This category includes a diverse range of games such as Astro Bot, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Balatro, and others[2][4][5].\n- **Best Multiplayer Game**: Other contenders include Abiotic Factor, EA Sports College Football 25, Sons Of The Forest, and Tekken 8[1][2][5].\n\n## Voting and Judging Process\nThe Golden Joystick Awards are largely based on community votes, with a judging panel consisting of Future editors and a network of journalists also playing a role in selecting the final winners[3].\n\n## Popularity and Critical Reception\nHelldivers 2 has received positive feedback, particularly for its co-op gameplay and dynamic missions. However, the ultimate decision will depend on the votes cast by the gaming community and the judgments made by the panel[4].\n\nGiven these points, while Helldivers 2 has a strong chance due to its multiple nominations and positive reception, it is not possible to definitively predict whether it will win in any category without knowing the final vote tallies and the judges' decisions. The outcome will be revealed during the live awards ceremony on November 21, 2024.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Helldivers 2 nominated for Console Game of the Year at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards?\nANSWER: YES, Helldivers 2 is nominated for Console Game of the Year at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards[3][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Helldivers 2 nominated for Best Multiplayer Game at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards?\nANSWER: YES, Helldivers 2 is nominated for the Best Multiplayer Game category at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Helldivers 2 won any other major gaming awards in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Helldivers 2 has won other major gaming awards in 2024.\n\n- At the Develop Star Awards 2024, Helldivers 2 won the award for **Best Game Design**[5].\n- Additionally, Helldivers 2 won the **Best Game Design** award at the MCA/Develop Awards 2024[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Helldivers 2 trending positively on social media platforms ahead of the awards?\nANSWER: Yes, Helldivers 2 is trending positively on social media platforms. The game has been noted for its viral social media campaign and the ongoing engagement of its community through fun videos and updates from the support team. This has helped keep the game in the zeitgeist and maintained a strong community interest even after its release[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Helldivers 2 nominated for Best Game Trailer at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards?\nANSWER: No, Helldivers 2 is not nominated for the Best Game Trailer category at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards. The nominees for the Best Game Trailer category include trailers for games such as \"Caravan Sandwitch,\" \"Death Stranding 2: On The Beach,\" \"Kingmakers,\" \"Sid Meier’s Civilization VII,\" and \"The Plucky Squire,\" but Helldivers 2's trailer is not listed among them[3][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there other nominated games in the same categories that are more popular than Helldivers 2?\nANSWER: Yes, there are other games that are more popular than Helldivers 2 in terms of concurrent player counts and overall popularity.\n\n- Helldivers 2 peaked at 409,367 concurrent players on Steam, which places it 24th in the list of games with the highest online ratings on Steam[2][4][5].\n- Games like PUBG, Palworld, Counter-Strike 2, and others have significantly higher concurrent player counts. For example, PUBG peaked at 3,257,248 players, and Palworld at 2,101,867 players[4].\n\nTherefore, there are indeed other nominated games in the same categories that are more popular than Helldivers 2.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Helldivers 2 have a larger player base than its competitors in the multiplayer category?\nANSWER: Based on the current data, it is unclear whether Helldivers 2 has a larger player base than its competitors in the multiplayer category.\n\nAt its peak, Helldivers 2 had an impressive player count, exceeding 400,000 concurrent players on Steam, which was higher than some other major releases like Starfield and Baldur's Gate 3[1][2][3].\n\nHowever, as of recent months, the player count has significantly declined, with the game losing around 90% of its players, resulting in a current peak of around 44,000 to 50,000 concurrent players[2][3][5].\n\nWithout real-time data on the current player counts of its competitors, it is impossible to determine if Helldivers 2 still has a larger player base than other multiplayer games in the category.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have games similar to Helldivers 2 won awards at previous Golden Joystick Awards?\nANSWER: To determine if games similar to Helldivers 2 have won awards at previous Golden Joystick Awards, we need to consider the genre and type of games that have been recognized in the past.\n\nHelldivers 2 is a cooperative third-person shooter known for its dynamic gameplay and cooperative elements. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Genre Representation**: The Golden Joystick Awards have a history of recognizing games across various genres, including action, shooter, and cooperative games. However, specific details about past winners in the exact genre of cooperative third-person shooters are not provided in the sources[1][2][5].\n\n2. **Past Winners**: The sources do not specify past winners of the Golden Joystick Awards in detail, particularly focusing on games similar to Helldivers 2. They primarily discuss the current year's nominations and voting process.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about past winners in the cooperative third-person shooter genre, we cannot definitively say whether games similar to Helldivers 2 have won awards at previous Golden Joystick Awards.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the gaming community showing strong support for Helldivers 2 in discussions about the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that Helldivers 2 is receiving significant attention and support within the context of the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards.\n\n- Helldivers 2 has four nominations, which is a notable number, indicating strong recognition by the awards committee and the industry[2][4][5].\n- The game is nominated in several prominent categories, including Console Game of the Year and Best Multiplayer Game, further highlighting its popularity and critical acclaim[4][5].\n- The voting process, which included a record 12 million votes, suggests that the gaming community is actively engaging with the awards, and Helldivers 2 being among the top nominees indicates it has a strong following[3].\n\nGiven this information, it can be inferred that the gaming community is indeed showing strong support for Helldivers 2 in discussions about the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Helldivers 2 received higher critical acclaim than its competitors in the nominated categories?\nANSWER: To determine if Helldivers 2 has received higher critical acclaim than its competitors, we need to look at the critical reception of Helldivers 2 and compare it to its peers in the same genre.\n\n### Helldivers 2 Critical Acclaim\n- Helldivers 2 has been praised by critics for its engaging gunplay, addictive cooperative gameplay, and dark humor. It is described as a chaotic third-person cooperative shooter with strategic depth and frantic action[4].\n- The game has received positive reviews for its varied and replayable missions, although it suffers from occasional server issues and repetitive missions[4].\n\n### Comparison to Competitors\n- While the sources provided do not offer a direct comparison of critical scores between Helldivers 2 and its specific competitors, they do highlight its unique strengths and popularity. For instance, Helldivers 2 is noted for its successful execution as a live-service game, which sets it apart from other games in the genre that have faced criticism for similar models[5].\n- There is no detailed comparison to games like Halo, Star Wars Battlefront 2, or other shooters in terms of critical acclaim. However, Helldivers 2 is praised for its unique blend of strategic teamplay and fun, high-octane action, which suggests it has a strong critical reception within its genre[3][4].\n\nGiven the information available, it is unclear whether Helldivers 2 has received higher critical acclaim than all of its competitors, as there is no direct comparison of critical scores or reviews provided.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 9 days (from November 12, 2024, to November 21, 2024)\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** Helldivers 2 is less likely to win in the specified categories due to strong competition from more popular and critically acclaimed games.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** The probability would remain similar, as significant shifts in voting or public opinion are unlikely in a shorter time frame.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** The probability might increase slightly if Helldivers 2 gains additional popularity or receives further critical acclaim, but the competition would also have more time to bolster their positions.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nHelldivers 2 is nominated for two of the three specified categories at the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards: **Best Multiplayer Game** and **Console Game of the Year**. However, it is not nominated for **Best Game Trailer**. The game has received positive feedback for its co-op gameplay and dynamic missions and has won other awards, such as **Best Game Design** at the Develop Star Awards 2024.\n\nDespite these accolades, Helldivers 2 faces stiff competition from other highly anticipated and critically acclaimed titles. In the **Console Game of the Year** category, competitors include **Final Fantasy VII Rebirth** and **The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom**, both of which have large, dedicated fan bases and have garnered significant attention. In the **Best Multiplayer Game** category, games like **Sons Of The Forest** and **Tekken 8** are strong contenders with substantial popularity.\n\nHelldivers 2 experienced a significant drop in its player base, losing around 90% of its players after launch, decreasing from a peak of over 400,000 concurrent players to around 44,000–50,000. This decline may impact its ability to secure enough community votes to win an award, especially since the Golden Joystick Awards rely heavily on public voting.\n\nWhile the game is trending positively on social media and maintains a strong community, larger and more popular games may overshadow it in the voting process. There is also no clear indication that Helldivers 2 has received higher critical acclaim than its competitors. Without strong evidence of overwhelming community support or critical dominance, the likelihood of Helldivers 2 winning in the specified categories is moderate.\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
