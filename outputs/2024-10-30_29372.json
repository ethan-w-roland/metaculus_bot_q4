    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Democratic Congressman Jared Golden be re-elected in Maine's 2nd Congressional District in the 2024 election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-30\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Jared Golden wins the election to the House of Representatives from Maine's 2nd Congressional District in the 2024 US general election. If any other candidate wins, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Maine's 2nd Congressional District](https://ballotpedia.org/Maine%27s_2nd_Congressional_District). The 2024 US general election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Democratic Congressman Jared Golden being re-elected in Maine's 2nd Congressional District in the 2024 election, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Competitive Nature of the District\nMaine's 2nd Congressional District is considered a battleground district. Despite being held by Democrats for most years since 1995, the district has voted for Republican presidential candidates, including Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020.\n\n## Candidate Positions and Controversies\nJared Golden has faced criticism for his shift in stance on gun control, particularly after a mass shooting in his hometown. This change has been highlighted by his Republican challenger, Austin Theriault, who accuses Golden of flip-flopping on the Second Amendment.\n\n## Election Forecasting\nAs of October 17, 2024, four major election forecasters have differing ratings for the general election. Three rate it as a toss-up, while one rates it as Lean Democratic.\n\n## Historical Context\nGolden has won the district using ranked-choice voting in previous elections, including in 2018 and 2022. However, the district's conservative leanings and the national parties' significant investment in the race suggest it remains highly competitive.\n\n## Current State of the Campaign\nThe campaign has been marked by intense rhetoric and significant spending by both national parties and their allies. Limited nonpartisan polling indicates the race is too close to call.\n\nGiven these factors, it is not possible to clearly answer the question with a yes or no based on the available information. The race is highly competitive, and the outcome will depend on various factors, including voter turnout, the impact of Golden's shift on gun control policies, and the overall political climate on Election Day.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout expected to be higher among Democratic voters in Maine's 2nd Congressional District in the 2024 election?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe provided sources do not offer specific data or predictions regarding the voter turnout among Democratic voters versus Republican voters in Maine's 2nd Congressional District for the 2024 election. While the sources provide information on the candidates, past election results, and the competitive nature of the district, they do not include forecasts or data on voter turnout by party affiliation for the upcoming election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has ranked-choice voting previously benefited Jared Golden in past elections?\nANSWER: Yes, ranked-choice voting has previously benefited Jared Golden in past elections.\n\nIn the 2018 general election, Golden won the 2nd Congressional District seat through a ranked-choice voting runoff, overcoming an initial deficit by securing the second- and third-choice votes of voters who had cast their ballots for independent candidates Tiffany Bond and William Hoar.\n\nSimilarly, in the 2022 election, Golden retained his seat in the 2nd Congressional District after a ranked-choice runoff, where he gained enough votes from supporters of independent candidate Tiffany Bond to push him above the 50% threshold.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major media outlets projected Jared Golden as the likely winner in Maine's 2nd Congressional District?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no clear consensus from major media outlets projecting Jared Golden as the likely winner in Maine's 2nd Congressional District.\n\n- The Bangor Daily News and Maine Morning Star reports highlight a tight race between Golden and Austin Theriault, with Theriault even leading in one poll.\n- The Hill and DDHQ forecast shows a higher win percentage for Jared Golden, but this is a model-based prediction rather than a definitive projection by the outlet itself.\n- Ballotpedia and the Boston Globe provide context and analysis but do not make a definitive projection.\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been significant changes in voter registration or party affiliation in Maine's 2nd Congressional District?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating significant changes in voter registration or party affiliation exclusively within Maine's 2nd Congressional District.\n\n- The sources discuss general voter registration processes in Maine, including the ability to register on Election Day and the use of ranked-choice voting, but they do not provide district-specific data on changes in voter registration or party affiliation.\n- There is information on the candidates running in the 2024 general election for Maine's 2nd Congressional District, but no details on changes in voter registration or party affiliation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are national political parties heavily investing resources in Maine's 2nd Congressional District for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: YES\n\nNational political parties are indeed investing resources in Maine's 2nd Congressional District for the 2024 election. Here are some indicators of this investment:\n\n- Both parties are spending money on advertising in the district, with Democrats outspending Republicans on presidential advertising, though the overall spending is not extremely high.\n- The Democratic Party has increased the number of field offices in the district to 14, up from 11 in 2020.\n- National parties and their allies are spending millions of dollars in the final weeks of the campaign, indicating that the seat is still considered up for grabs.\n- The national parties and outside groups, such as the One for All Committee, are also involved in advertising and other campaign activities in the district.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Jared Golden's shift on gun control policies significantly affected his support among voters in his district?\nANSWER: The impact of Jared Golden's shift on gun control policies on his support among voters in his district is not clearly defined in the provided sources, but there are some indications of potential consequences and reactions.\n\n- Golden's reversal on supporting an assault weapons ban has been met with mixed reactions. He has faced criticism from both his own party and from Republicans, which could potentially affect his voter support. For instance, Republicans are hoping to use this shift to oust him from his conservative-leaning district.\n- Golden's new stance has also been criticized by gun-rights groups, such as the Sportsmanâ€™s Alliance of Maine, which could influence voters who are strong supporters of gun rights.\n- However, the sources do not provide specific polling data or voter surveys that would indicate a significant change in his support levels among voters in his district.\n\nGiven the lack of direct evidence on voter support, the answer to whether his shift has significantly affected his support among voters is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 30, 2024, is Jared Golden leading in the polls for Maine's 2nd Congressional District?\nANSWER: As of October 30, 2024, the polling data indicates that the race for Maine's 2nd Congressional District is very close and not clearly in favor of either candidate.\n\n- A poll released by Digital Research Inc. showed that both Jared Golden and Austin Theriault were tied at 38% support, with 21% of respondents undecided and 3% declining to state their preference.\n- Another poll from Pan Atlantic Research showed Theriault leading Golden by a narrow margin, 47% to 44%, although this was from an earlier date.\n\nGiven this information, it is unclear whether Jared Golden is leading in the polls as of October 30, 2024, since the most recent polls indicate a virtual dead heat.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Republican challenger in Maine's 2nd Congressional District considered a strong candidate with significant support?\nANSWER: Yes, the Republican challenger in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, Austin Theriault, is considered a strong candidate with significant support.\n\n- Theriault has secured the early backing of national Republicans, including an endorsement from former President Donald Trump, and was recruited by former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n- Despite being a relative newcomer to politics, Theriault is seen as a viable challenger who avoids the pitfalls of being labeled a career politician, which has helped in his campaign.\n- Independent groups have spent heavily to support Theriault, with nearly $9.4 million spent to support him and attack his opponent, Jared Golden.\n- The race is considered a \"toss-up\" by national analysts, and Republicans are investing heavily in the race, indicating their confidence in Theriault's candidacy.\n- Theriault has also shown strong support among certain demographics, such as men, younger voters, and unenrolled voters.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the political climate in 2024 favoring Democratic candidates in U.S. Congressional elections?\nANSWER: The political climate in the 2024 U.S. Congressional elections does not clearly favor Democratic candidates outright. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Competitiveness**: The elections are expected to be highly competitive, with forecasts suggesting less than a 5-seat difference between the two parties.\n\n2. **House Race Ratings**: The Cook Political Report ratings indicate a mixed landscape. While there are districts rated as \"Solid Democrat,\" \"Likely Democrat,\" and \"Lean Democrat,\" there are also districts rated as \"Solid Republican,\" \"Likely Republican,\" and \"Lean Republican,\" as well as several \"Toss Up\" districts on both sides.\n\n3. **Current Control**: Republicans currently hold a majority in the U.S. House, and the elections will determine whether this control changes.\n\nGiven these points, the political climate is more indicative of a closely contested election rather than one that clearly favors Democratic candidates. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Jared Golden faced any major scandals or controversies that could negatively impact his re-election chances?\nANSWER: Jared Golden has been involved in several controversies and criticisms that could potentially impact his re-election chances:\n\n1. **Criticism for Stance on Trump's Re-election**: Golden faced disappointment from Democratic lawmakers and community leaders for his op-ed where he predicted a Trump victory and argued that Congress would be a sufficient check on Trump's administration. This stance was seen as minimizing the threats posed by a second Trump presidency to various rights and communities.\n\n2. **Accusations of Not Supporting Biden**: Golden has been criticized for not clearly supporting Joe Biden's re-election and for questioning Biden's health. This has led to accusations from Republican opponents and some Democrats that he is not committed to supporting the Democratic Party's presidential candidate.\n\n3. **Misrepresentation in Republican Ads**: Golden was the target of a digital ad campaign by the National Republican Congressional Committee that falsely claimed he had private meetings with Biden and witnessed Biden's mental failures. This misinformation could affect public perception of Golden.\n\n4. **Voting Record and Party Loyalty**: Golden has a history of voting against some Democratic Party positions, such as opposing gun control measures and not voting for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House. This has led to criticism from within his own party and could alienate some Democratic voters.\n\n5. **Shift in Gun Control Stance**: After previously opposing several gun control measures, Golden changed his stance to support a federal ban on assault weapons following a mass shooting in his district. This shift, while potentially positive for some voters, could also be seen as opportunistic by others.\n\nThese controversies and criticisms highlight the challenges Golden faces in his re-election bid, particularly in a district that has been carried by Donald Trump in previous elections.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\n- The general election for Maine's 2nd Congressional District is scheduled for **November 5, 2024**.\n- Today's date is **October 30, 2024**.\n- Therefore, there are **6 days** until the election.\n- The results may be finalized within a few days to a week after the election, depending on vote counting and the ranked-choice voting process.\n- Approximately **1-2 weeks** until the outcome is known.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\n- The race is currently a **toss-up** according to major election forecasters.\n- Polls indicate that the race is **too close to call**, with some showing a tie and others showing a slight lead for either candidate.\n- Jared Golden has the **incumbency advantage** and experience with **ranked-choice voting**, which has benefited him in past elections.\n- If nothing changed, the slight edge might go to **Jared Golden** due to his incumbency and past success in similar tight races.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\n- With only **1-2 days** left until the election, voter opinions are largely formed.\n- Last-minute campaign efforts are unlikely to cause significant shifts.\n- Given the current data, I would forecast a **55% probability** that Jared Golden will be re-elected, acknowledging the high uncertainty but slight incumbency advantage.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\n- With approximately **24 weeks (about 6 months)** until the election, there's ample time for significant developments.\n- Potential factors include shifts in the national political climate, major campaign events, or changes in voter sentiment.\n- I would forecast a **50% probability**, reflecting the high uncertainty and the possibility for either candidate to gain an advantage.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Incumbency Advantage:** Jared Golden, as the incumbent, benefits from name recognition, established political networks, and prior electoral experience in the district.\n\n- **Ranked-Choice Voting Success:** Golden has effectively utilized Maine's ranked-choice voting system in previous elections (2018 and 2022) to secure victories, suggesting he can appeal to a broader range of voters, including those whose first-choice candidates are independents.\n\n- **Competitive District Dynamics:** Maine's 2nd Congressional District is historically competitive, with a tendency to swing between parties. It has conservative leanings, having voted for Donald Trump in both 2016 and 2020, which could favor the Republican challenger.\n\n- **Strength of Challenger:** Austin Theriault is a strong Republican candidate with significant national party support, endorsements (including from former President Trump), and substantial campaign funding. His background and appeal could resonate with voters in the district.\n\n- **Policy Shifts and Controversies:**\n  - Golden's recent shift to support a federal ban on assault weapons, following a mass shooting, may have a mixed impact:\n    - **Potential Negative Impact:** Could alienate voters who prioritize Second Amendment rights and see this as a betrayal of previous positions.\n    - **Potential Positive Impact:** May attract voters who are concerned about gun violence and support stricter gun control measures.\n  - Golden has faced criticism for his stances on other issues, but no major scandals have severely undermined his campaign.\n\n- **Campaign Investments:** Both national parties are heavily investing in this race, indicating its importance and competitiveness. Significant spending on advertising and field operations could mobilize voters.\n\n- **Polling Indicators:** Limited nonpartisan polling shows the race is extremely close, with a significant portion of undecided voters. This underscores the uncertainty and the potential for either candidate to prevail.\n\n- **Voter Turnout:** High turnout could be a deciding factor. However, without clear data on which party might benefit more, it's difficult to assess its impact.\n\n- **National Political Climate:** As the election coincides with the presidential race, national trends and the popularity of the presidential candidates may influence down-ballot races. Coattail effects could play a role, but the direction is unclear.\n\n---\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the race is highly competitive with a high degree of uncertainty. Jared Golden's incumbency and past success with ranked-choice voting provide a slight advantage, but the strong challenge posed by Austin Theriault and the district's conservative tendencies balance the scales.\n\n**Probability: 55%**",
