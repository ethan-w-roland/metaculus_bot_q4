    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Nick Sirianni cease to be the Philadelphia Eagles head coach before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-18\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before January 1, 2025, Nick Sirianni is no longer head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) such as the official Cowboys website [coaches roster](https://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/team/coaches/). Otherwise this question resolves as **No.**\n\nBACKGROUND:\nClutchPoints: [Eagles fans want Nick Sirianni fired after bizarre calls](https://clutchpoints.com/eagles-news-fans-want-nick-sirianni-fired-bizarre-calls)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Nick Sirianni will cease to be the Philadelphia Eagles head coach before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Job Security and Performance\n- Despite a significant late-season collapse in the 2023 season, where the Eagles went 1-6 in their final seven games, Sirianni was retained by the Eagles' owner Jeffrey Lurie and general manager Howie Roseman[5].\n- Sirianni has a strong overall record with the Eagles, including a 34-17 (.667) record in his first three seasons, and he is the only head coach in Eagles history to begin his tenure with three straight playoff appearances[3][5].\n\n## Recent Season Start and Challenges\n- The Eagles started the 2024 season with a 2-2 record, which led to some speculation about Sirianni's job security. However, Sirianni emphasized his focus on improving the team rather than worrying about his job status[2].\n- The team has made significant changes, including new coordinators Kellen Moore on offense and Vic Fangio on defense, which suggests an effort to address last season's issues[4][5].\n\n## Organizational Support\n- General manager Howie Roseman has publicly supported Sirianni, highlighting his achievements and commitment to the team[5].\n\n## Current Season Performance\n- As of November 18, 2024, the Eagles are 8-2 and in a strong position in the NFC, which indicates that the team is performing well under Sirianni's leadership[1].\n\nGiven these points, while there is always some level of uncertainty in the NFL regarding coaching positions, the current evidence suggests that Sirianni's job is not immediately at risk. However, the NFL is known for its unpredictability, and performance over the remainder of the season will be crucial.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, NFL coaches with strong records and recent playoff appearances are less likely to be fired mid-season, but late-season collapses or significant underperformance can still lead to changes.\n- The Eagles' front office has shown a commitment to Sirianni, but if the team's performance deteriorates significantly, this could change.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The answer to whether Sirianni will cease to be the head coach before January 1, 2025, will likely be determined by the team's performance over the next few weeks and any potential playoff run.\n\nIn summary, while there are no clear indications that Sirianni will be fired before January 1, 2025, based on current information, the final decision will depend on the team's continued performance and any unforeseen developments.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Nick Sirianni currently the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles?\nANSWER: YES, Nick Sirianni is currently the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles. This is confirmed by multiple sources, including his profile on the Philadelphia Eagles' website and recent news articles discussing his job status for the 2024 season[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nick Sirianni expressed any desire or intention to resign before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of Nick Sirianni expressing any desire or intention to resign before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss his coaching career, recent press conferences, and his approach to the 2024 season, but do not indicate any plans for resignation.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Nick Sirianni under contract with the Philadelphia Eagles beyond January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: No, Nick Sirianni is not under contract with the Philadelphia Eagles beyond January 1, 2025. His five-year contract, which he signed in 2021, runs through the 2025 season[1][3][5]. This indicates that his current contract will expire at the end of the 2025 season, not extending beyond January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the Eagles missed the playoffs or underperformed significantly under Nick Sirianni this season?\nANSWER: No, the Eagles have not missed the playoffs or underperformed significantly under Nick Sirianni this season. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Philadelphia Eagles currently have a record of 8-2, which is a strong performance[2][4][5].\n- They are leading the NFC East division[2][5].\n- The team has a 6-game winning streak, indicating consistent performance[2].\n- Their point differential is +80, and they have a high win percentage in the months of October and November[2].\n\nThese indicators suggest that the Eagles are performing well under Nick Sirianni this season.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the Philadelphia Eagles publicly expressed support for Nick Sirianni recently?\nANSWER: Yes, the Philadelphia Eagles and their players have publicly expressed support for Nick Sirianni recently.\n\nIn a press conference, quarterback Jalen Hurts mentioned that he and other players encouraged Sirianni to be himself and that they trust him as a coach. Hurts stated, \"It's just a reassurance of we trust who you are, we trust where you are as a coach and we know we can build with you,\" indicating the team's support and trust in Sirianni's leadership[5].\n\nAdditionally, Sirianni's interactions and the team's performance have been discussed positively in various press conferences, highlighting the team's collective effort and trust in his coaching[2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any credible news suggesting Nick Sirianni might be fired before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: While there are significant concerns and speculations about Nick Sirianni's job security, the sources do not indicate that his firing is imminent or certain before January 1, 2025.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- Sirianni's job security is under scrutiny due to the Eagles' recent performances, but owner Jeffrey Lurie has shown a tendency to give coaches time to improve[2][4].\n- Despite the team's struggles, Lurie has expressed support for Sirianni and has not historically made coaching changes mid-season unless there are extraordinary circumstances[4].\n- The Eagles' performance over the next few games will be crucial, but as of now, there is no concrete indication that Sirianni will be fired before the end of 2024[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do the Philadelphia Eagles have a history of firing coaches late in the season?\nANSWER: Yes, the Philadelphia Eagles have a history of firing coaches, often in response to poor performance or significant changes in the team's direction, even if it is late in the season or shortly after.\n\n- Andy Reid, who had been with the Eagles for 14 years, was fired after a 4-12 season in 2012, just one day after the season ended[2].\n- Doug Pederson, despite leading the Eagles to their first Super Bowl title, was fired after a disappointing 2020 season, just three years after the Super Bowl victory[3][4].\n- Chip Kelly was fired during the 2015 season, before all 16 games were completed, due to poor performance and internal issues[1].\n\nThese examples indicate that the Eagles have been willing to make coaching changes relatively quickly when they feel it is necessary for the team's future success.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nick Sirianni been involved in any scandals or controversies recently?\nANSWER: YES\n\nNick Sirianni, the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, has been involved in several controversies recently. Here are some key points:\n\n- Sirianni was criticized for his behavior during and after a game against the Cleveland Browns, where he gestured and jawed at Eagles fans who were booing and chanting \"Fire Nick!\"[2][4][5].\n- Former Eagles linebacker Emmanuel Acho criticized Sirianni's actions, suggesting a disconnect between the coach and the passionate Eagles fanbase[1].\n- Sirianni apologized for his behavior, stating that his energy was misdirected and that he should have focused more on coaching and motivating his team[2][4].\n- This incident is not isolated, as Sirianni has a history of controversial interactions with fans, including an incident last season where he taunted opposing fans after a game[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any reports of significant conflicts between Nick Sirianni and the Eagles' management or players?\nANSWER: Yes, there are reports of significant conflicts between Nick Sirianni and both the players and the broader team environment.\n\n1. **Conflict with Jalen Hurts**: There has been a reported strain between Sirianni and quarterback Jalen Hurts, particularly during the 2023 campaign. This strain was described as a \"fractured\" and unhealthy relationship, primarily due to a disconnect in their offensive visions[4].\n\n2. **Conflict with AJ Brown**: Tension has been reported between Sirianni and wide receiver AJ Brown, which is affecting the entire team. Brown's frustration with the coaching staff's playcalling and decisions has been visible, and his dissatisfaction is seen as a significant issue within the team[5].\n\n3. **Taunting Fans and Internal Tensions**: Sirianni had a heated spat with Eagles fans after a game, which led to widespread criticism. This incident, along with his subsequent apology, highlights the tension between Sirianni and the fan base, as well as internal issues within the team[3].\n\n4. **General Team Dynamics**: There have been reports of a broader disconnect within the team, including grumbling and sideline spats, particularly after the Eagles' collapse in the latter part of the 2023 season. Sirianni's efforts to address these issues and take accountability have been noted, but the underlying tensions remain[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Philadelphia Eagles' performance in the 2024 season strong?\nANSWER: The performance of the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2024 season can be evaluated from several perspectives, and it has shown both strong and weak aspects.\n\n### Strong Aspects:\n- After a shaky 2-2 start, the Eagles have put together a significant winning streak, leading to an 8-2 record and first place in the NFC East as of Week 11[2][4].\n- Jalen Hurts has been a key contributor, with 12 total touchdowns and a completion rate of over 69% of his passes. He also led the team to a crucial win over the Washington Commanders with a strong fourth-quarter performance[2].\n- The team has shown resilience and improvement, particularly after their early-season bye, with wins against several opponents including the Cleveland Browns, New York Giants, Cincinnati Bengals, and Jacksonville Jaguars[4].\n\n### Weak Aspects:\n- The Eagles started the season with a 2-2 record, which included a heartbreaker loss to the Falcons and a significant loss to the Buccaneers. This early performance was considered underwhelming given their preseason expectations[1][5].\n- There have been disappointments in various areas, such as the defensive line's performance, particularly against the run, and some inconsistent play from key players like Jordan Davis and Jalen Carter[1][5].\n- Jalen Hurts has also had issues with turnovers, which have been a significant concern early in the season[5].\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the mixed performance, it is not entirely clear-cut to label the Eagles' performance as solely \"strong.\" While they have shown significant improvement and are currently leading their division, there have been notable areas of concern and underperformance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: Approximately 6 weeks remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed**: If the current situation remains the same, Nick Sirianni will continue as the head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, so the outcome would be **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: With about 1.5 weeks left, the probability of Sirianni ceasing to be head coach before January 1, 2025, would be even lower, perhaps around **2%**.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left**: With approximately 24 weeks (about 6 months) until the deadline, the probability would increase due to potential off-season changes, possibly around **15%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nNick Sirianni is currently leading the Philadelphia Eagles to a strong season with an **8-2 record**, placing them at the top of the **NFC East division**. The team has shown significant improvement after a 2-2 start, and they are on a winning streak. Under his leadership, the Eagles have made three straight playoff appearances, and he holds a 34-17 (.667) record over his first three seasons.\n\nWhile there have been reports of controversies and conflicts involving Sirianni, such as tensions with key players like **Jalen Hurts** and **AJ Brown**, and incidents involving fan interactions, the team's on-field success suggests that his position is relatively secure in the short term. NFL organizations typically do not dismiss head coaches who are leading their teams to successful seasons unless there are severe and immediate issues.\n\nHistorically, the Eagles have been willing to make coaching changes, but these have usually occurred after a season concludes or in response to significant underperformance. Given the limited time frame of **6 weeks** until January 1, 2025, it is unlikely that the Eagles' management would make a coaching change during a strong playoff push.\n\nHowever, the NFL is unpredictable, and unforeseen developments could occur, such as a dramatic downturn in team performance or escalated conflicts within the organization. Accounting for these possibilities, there remains a small chance of a coaching change before the specified date.\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
