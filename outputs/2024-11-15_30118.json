    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Yellow be the closest color to the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-15\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve based on the Hue of Pantone's Color Of The Year for 2025. Specifically, the color's hex code will be transformed to the HSV model and the question will resolve as **Yes** if 45 ≤ H < 75.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- If Pantone releases two Colors Of The Year for 2025, the one used for resolution will be the color named first in their announcement. In 2016, that would have been Rose Quartz and, in 2021, that would have been Ultimate Gray. If Pantone fails to announce a Color of the Year in 2024, then this question will be **annulled**.\n- The color definitions are of course imperfect, sorry about that.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nEach December, the Pantone Color Institute reveals its \"[Color of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantone#Color_of_the_Year)\", which influences design, fashion, and product development for the following year. This tradition of annual color selection has become a widely anticipated event in creative industries, with shades often expressing broader cultural themes. Pantone [bases its choice](https://www.pantone.com/articles/color-of-the-year/choosing-the-pantone-color-of-the-year) on trends in various domains, including fashion, interior design, art, and digital aesthetics, reflecting colors that are anticipated to resonate globally.\n\nHere are the colors of the year from the last ten years and how this question would have resolved\n\n- 2024: **Peach Fuzz** (Orange)\n- 2023: **Viva Magenta** (Red)\n- 2022: **Very Peri** (Blue)\n- 2021: **Ultimate Gray** (Blue) and **Illuminating** (Yellow)\n- 2020: **Classic Blue** (Blue)\n- 2019: **Living Coral** (Red)\n- 2018: **Ultra Violet** (Violet)\n- 2017: **Greenery** (Green)\n- 2016: **Rose Quartz** (Red) and **Serenity** (Blue)\n- 2015: **Marsala** (Red)\n\nThe Color Of The Year for 2025 is expected to be announced on [December 5, 2024](https://www.pantone.com/uk/en/color-of-the-year/2025/countdown).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if yellow will be the closest color to the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Pantone's Selection Process\nPantone's Color of the Year is chosen by the Pantone Color Institute, which considers a wide range of cultural, artistic, and design influences from around the world, including fashion, art, and social trends[5].\n\n## Current Trends and Predictions\n- While yellow is a trending color for 2025, as seen in other paint companies' selections (e.g., Dulux's 'True Joy' and its inclusion in various 2025 color palettes)[3][4], it is not the only contender for Pantone's Color of the Year.\n- The recent Pantone trend forecasts from London and New York Fashion Weeks suggest several colors, including green shades like 'White Grape' and 'Viridian Green', and also yellow shades like 'Yellow Jasper'[5].\n\n## Specific Predictions\n- VeriVide's prediction article mentions 'Yellow Jasper 12-0719 TCX' as a possible candidate, but it also suggests other colors like 'White Grape' and various green shades could be in the running[5].\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile yellow is a strong contender and is featured prominently in 2025 color trends, it is not certain that it will be the exact Pantone Color of the Year. Other colors, particularly green shades, are also significant in the current trend forecasts. Therefore, the answer to whether yellow will be the closest color to the 2025 Pantone Color of the Year is not immediately clear and will be determined by Pantone's official announcement on December 5, 2024[5].\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is \"Yellow Jasper\" being predicted as a potential candidate for Pantone's 2025 Color of the Year?\nANSWER: YES, \"Yellow Jasper\" is being predicted as a potential candidate for Pantone's 2025 Color of the Year. This is mentioned in the sources that discuss possible colors for the upcoming year, including the predictions based on the Spring/Summer 2025 fashion trends[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Pantone's Color of the Year often coincided with the colors selected by other major color authorities?\nANSWER: The information provided does not specifically address whether Pantone's Color of the Year has often coincided with the colors selected by other major color authorities. The sources focus on Pantone's selection process, the significance of their Color of the Year, and how it influences various industries, but they do not compare Pantone's choices with those of other major color authorities.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major design and fashion trends for 2025 highlighting yellow as a significant color?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nMajor design and fashion trends for 2025 are indeed highlighting yellow as a significant color in various forms:\n\n- Dulux has announced \"True Joy,\" a bright and energising yellow, as their Colour of the Year for 2025, emphasizing its uplifting and optimistic qualities[1].\n\n- In fashion, bright butter yellow and sunny yellows are trending for winter 2025, noted for their mood-boosting and feel-good effects[2][5].\n\n- Earthy-rich yellows, including mustard and butter yellow, are also predicted to be popular in both interiors and fashion, offering comfort and a calming yet uplifting feel[3][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any reliable sources leaked or hinted that yellow will be Pantone's Color of the Year for 2025?\nANSWER: While there are no official announcements from Pantone itself, some sources have made predictions and hints about the possibility of yellow being the Color of the Year for 2025.\n\n- A prediction article from VeriVide suggests that a yellow shade, such as **Yellow Jasper 12-0719 TCX**, could be a potential candidate for Pantone's Color of the Year 2025, based on trends observed at fashion weeks[2].\n- Another source mentions that yellow is having a renaissance in color trends for 2025, but it does not specifically indicate that Pantone will choose yellow as its Color of the Year[3].\n\nHowever, these are just predictions and not official leaks or confirmations from Pantone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as there is no definitive or reliable source confirming that yellow will be Pantone's Color of the Year for 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Pantone avoided selecting similar color families within a three-year timeframe in the past?\nANSWER: No, Pantone has not always avoided selecting similar color families within a three-year timeframe. Here are some examples:\n\n## 2003 and 2005\nIn 2003, the Color of the Year was Aqua Sky, a blue-green color, and in 2005, it was Blue Turquoise, another blue-green hue. These colors are quite similar and fall within the same color family, occurring just two years apart[1][3][4].\n\n## 2010 and Previous Years\nIn 2010, Turquoise was selected, which is similar to the colors chosen in 2003 (Aqua Sky) and 2005 (Blue Turquoise). This indicates that Pantone did not avoid selecting similar color families within a relatively short period[1][4][5].\n\nThese examples demonstrate that Pantone has indeed selected similar color families within a three-year timeframe in the past.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Pantone's trend forecast for Spring/Summer 2025 feature yellow tones prominently?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the prominence of yellow tones in Pantone's trend forecast for Spring/Summer 2025 can be assessed as follows:\n\nFor New York Fashion Week (NYFW) Spring/Summer 2025, one of the standout colors mentioned is PANTONE 14-0747 TCX Misted Marigold, which is a convivial yellow filled with intrinsic energy[3].\n\nFor London Fashion Week (LFW) Spring/Summer 2025, while the palette is described as featuring a variety of colors, there is no specific mention of prominent yellow tones. However, there is a mention of PANTONE 11-0615 ‘Pear Sorbet’, which is a pale yellow with a blend of sweetness, but it is described as a \"discreet aerated pastel\" rather than a prominent or bold yellow tone[1][5].\n\nTherefore, while yellow tones are present, they are not universally prominent across both NYFW and LFW forecasts. However, they do appear in specific colors within the forecasts.\n\n**YES**, but with the clarification that they are not universally prominent across all forecasts.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are cultural or societal trends in 2024 emphasizing themes associated with yellow, such as optimism and positivity?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are indications that themes associated with the color yellow, such as optimism and positivity, are still relevant and emphasized in various contexts in 2024.\n\n1. **Color Psychology and Branding**: The article from ColorWhistle discusses how yellow is associated with optimism, happiness, and playfulness, and suggests that industries such as fitness, digital, and budget can opt for yellow in their branding to evoke these emotions. This implies that the positive associations of yellow are still valued in marketing and branding strategies in 2024[5].\n\n2. **Color Trends and Popularity**: The article from Dunn-Edwards mentions that a bolder shade of yellow has surged in popularity in recent years due to its connection with Gen Z, indicating that yellow's youthful, fun, and energetic vibes are currently in vogue[1].\n\n3. **General Symbolism**: The sources consistently highlight that yellow symbolizes joy, happiness, energy, and optimism, which are themes that continue to be emphasized across different contexts, including color psychology, design, and branding[2][3][4].\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that cultural or societal trends in 2024 are indeed emphasizing themes associated with yellow, such as optimism and positivity.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has green been more prominently featured than yellow in 2025 color trend predictions by industry experts?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it does not appear that green has been more prominently featured than yellow in the 2025 color trend predictions.\n\n- While green is mentioned, it is often in the context of specific shades like emerald green in fashion trends[5] or as part of broader earthy and natural color palettes[2][3][4], it is not consistently highlighted as a dominant color across all sources.\n- Yellow, on the other hand, is frequently mentioned as a key color for 2025, with various shades such as bright butter yellow, mustard yellow, and ochre yellow being highlighted in both interior design and fashion trends[1][2][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that yellow may be more prominently featured than green in the 2025 color trend predictions.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Pantone ever selected a color with a hue between 45° and 75° (yellow) as the Color of the Year in the past ten years?\nANSWER: To determine if Pantone has selected a color with a hue between 45° and 75° (which corresponds to the yellow spectrum) as the Color of the Year in the past ten years, we need to examine the colors chosen by Pantone for each year from 2015 to 2024.\n\n- **2022:** Very Peri, a dynamic periwinkle blue, was chosen[2].\n- **2021:** Illuminating (a bright yellow) and Ultimate Gray were chosen. Illuminating is indeed a yellow shade[2].\n- **2020:** Classic Blue was chosen[2].\n- **2019:** Living Coral was chosen, which has a golden undertone but is not purely yellow[2].\n- **2018:** Ultra Violet was chosen[2].\n- **2017:** Greenery, a yellow-green shade, was chosen, but it leans more towards green than pure yellow[2].\n\nGiven this information, the only year in the past ten years where a color with a hue between 45° and 75° (yellow) was selected as the Color of the Year is **2021**, when Illuminating, a bright yellow shade, was one of the two colors chosen.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have other major paint companies selected a yellow shade as their Color of the Year for 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication that any major paint companies have selected a yellow shade as their Color of the Year for 2025.\n\n- The colors mentioned for 2025 include various shades such as reds, blues, purples, browns, and blacks, but no yellow shades are listed[1][2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**",
    "comment": "(a) Time left until the outcome: **20 days**.\n\n(b) If nothing changed, the outcome would remain uncertain, with a moderate chance of being Yellow.\n\n(c) If there was only a quarter of the time left (5 days), I would forecast a probability of **30%**.\n\n(d) If there was 4 times the time left (80 days), I would forecast a probability of **20%**.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nRecent trends and predictions suggest that Yellow is a strong contender for Pantone's Color of the Year 2025. Various sources highlight Yellow shades like \"Yellow Jasper\" as potential candidates, and themes associated with Yellow—such as optimism and positivity—are emphasized in 2024 cultural and societal trends. Major design and fashion trends for 2025 are also highlighting Yellow as a significant color.\n\nHowever, there are other colors, particularly Green, that are also being considered strong contenders. Pantone's trend forecasts include a variety of colors, and there is no definitive evidence or reliable leaks confirming that Yellow will be the selected color. Additionally, the base rate of Yellow being chosen as the Color of the Year is low—only once in the past ten years (in 2021) did it fall within the Yellow hue range.\n\nGiven the combination of a low base rate but strong current trends favoring Yellow, I adjust the probability upwards from the base rate to account for these factors. With 20 days left until the announcement, significant changes in trends are less likely, but the absence of concrete evidence keeps the probability moderate.\n\nIf there were only 5 days left, the reduced time for new information to emerge would slightly increase my confidence, raising the probability to **30%**. Conversely, if there were 80 days left, the increased time allows for potential shifts in trends and the emergence of other strong contenders, so I would reduce the probability to **20%**.\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
