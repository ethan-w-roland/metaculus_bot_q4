    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill a new nuclear-armed state emerge before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-14\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, credible evidence becomes available that a country not currently possessing nuclear weapons has successfully developed and tested a nuclear weapon. The current nuclear-armed states are the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea.\n\nThis evidence can come from one or more of the following sources:\n\nAn official announcement or acknowledgment by the government of the country in question that it has developed and tested a nuclear weapon.\nConfirmation from a recognized international organization (e.g., International Atomic Energy Agency, Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization) or a major intelligence agency (e.g., CIA, MI6, FSB) that the country in question has developed and tested a nuclear weapon.\nDetection and verification of a nuclear test by a global monitoring network, such as the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), with widespread international consensus on the identity of the country responsible for the test\n\nBACKGROUND:\nSince the dawn of the nuclear age, the number of nuclear-armed states has slowly increased, with [nine countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons) currently possessing nuclear weapons. Nuclear nonproliferation efforts, such as the [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/), have played a crucial role in preventing the further spread of nuclear weapons. However, concerns persist about the potential for additional countries to pursue nuclear weapons capabilities, either secretly or openly, which could destabilize regional and global security.\n\nThe emergence of a new nuclear-armed state could have significant implications for international security, potentially triggering arms races or geopolitical realignments. It is therefore important to assess the likelihood of a new country successfully developing and testing a nuclear weapon by 2030, taking into account both announced and unannounced tests.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nThe emergence of a new nuclear-armed state before January 1, 2025, is a complex and uncertain scenario, influenced by several factors and current geopolitical dynamics. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Nuclear Landscape\n- The existing nuclear-armed states are the United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. There are no immediate indications of a new state on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons[4][5].\n\n## Geopolitical Tensions and Nonproliferation Efforts\n- The relationships between the U.S., Russia, and China are critical in determining the stability of the global nuclear order. However, these relationships are currently strained, and there is a lack of progress in disarmament and nonproliferation efforts[1][4][5].\n\n## Specific Countries of Concern\n- Iran is often mentioned as a potential candidate for nuclear proliferation, but as of the latest information, there is no confirmation that Iran has developed or will develop nuclear weapons before January 1, 2025[2].\n- Other countries that might consider acquiring nuclear weapons if they lose U.S. protection are discussed, but there is no concrete evidence to suggest any are on the cusp of doing so before the specified date[2].\n\n## International Agreements and Norms\n- The expiration of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) in February 2026 and the lack of a successor agreement could lead to increased nuclear tensions, but this does not directly imply the emergence of a new nuclear-armed state in the immediate future[1][4].\n\nGiven the current state of affairs and the lack of concrete evidence suggesting a new state is about to acquire nuclear weapons, it is not clear whether a new nuclear-armed state will emerge before January 1, 2025. The situation remains highly speculative and dependent on various geopolitical and diplomatic developments.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any non-nuclear state withdrawn from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any non-nuclear state withdrawing from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization detected a nuclear test from a non-nuclear state in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information indicating that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) has detected a nuclear test from a non-nuclear state in 2024. The sources discuss the general mechanisms and status of the CTBT, but they do not provide specific information about nuclear test detections in 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has North Korea transferred nuclear technology or materials to a non-nuclear state in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no evidence to suggest that North Korea has transferred nuclear technology or materials to a non-nuclear state in 2024. The sources discuss concerns about potential technology transfers from Russia to North Korea, as well as North Korea's provision of conventional arms to Russia, but they do not indicate any transfer of nuclear technology or materials from North Korea to another state.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that a new country has developed and tested a nuclear weapon?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources provided do not indicate that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed that a new country has developed and tested a nuclear weapon. The discussions focus on Iran's compliance with its nuclear safeguards agreements and the ongoing investigations into Iran's nuclear activities, but there is no mention of a new country developing or testing a nuclear weapon[1][2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there credible evidence that Iran has developed and tested a nuclear weapon as of November 14, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no credible evidence that Iran has developed and tested a nuclear weapon as of November 14, 2024.\n\n- The sources indicate that Iran has made significant progress in enriching uranium to near-weapons grade levels and has reduced its breakout time to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon to a matter of weeks or months[1][2][4].\n- However, they also highlight that while Iran has undertaken activities relevant to nuclear weaponization, such as producing uranium metal and conducting certain experiments, there is no confirmation of a full-scale nuclear test or the development of a functional nuclear weapon[1][2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any reports in 2024 of illicit transfers of nuclear materials or technology to non-nuclear states?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information regarding illicit transfers of nuclear materials or technology to non-nuclear states in 2024.\n\n- The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) does report on incidents of illicit trafficking and other unauthorized activities involving nuclear and radioactive material, but the sources provided do not include specific reports for 2024[1].\n- The other sources focus on the safe transport of radioactive material, regulatory violations, and enforcement actions by the NRC, but they do not mention illicit transfers to non-nuclear states[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant evidence that Saudi Arabia is pursuing nuclear weapons and is close to testing one?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThere is no significant evidence to suggest that Saudi Arabia is currently pursuing a nuclear weapons program or is close to testing a nuclear weapon. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- No credible evidence indicates that Saudi Arabia has ever pursued a nuclear weapons program[4].\n- Saudi Arabia is a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and has a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)[4].\n- While there have been reports and allegations of potential cooperation with other countries, such as Pakistan, these have been denied by both countries[2].\n- High-ranking Saudi officials have hinted at the possibility of acquiring nuclear weapons if Iran does so, but this does not constitute current pursuit or imminent testing[4].\n- The focus of Saudi Arabia's nuclear efforts has been on developing a civilian nuclear program for energy purposes, with plans to construct nuclear power reactors[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any non-nuclear state been detected conducting activities that violate the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons?\nANSWER: Yes, several non-nuclear weapon states have been detected conducting activities that violate the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n\n- Iran was found to have violated its NPT safeguards obligations, failing to report aspects of its enrichment program over an extended period[2][4][5].\n- Iraq was found by the IAEA to have violated its safeguards obligations and was subject to punitive sanctions by the UN Security Council[1][4][5].\n- Libya pursued a clandestine nuclear weapons program before abandoning it in 2003[1][4][5].\n- North Korea never came into compliance with its NPT safeguards agreement and later withdrew from the NPT to develop nuclear weapons[1][2][4].\n- Syria was also reported by the IAEA for non-compliance with its safeguards obligations[1][5].\n\nThese instances highlight significant violations of the NPT by non-nuclear weapon states.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major intelligence agencies reported that a non-nuclear state has developed and tested a nuclear weapon?\nANSWER: No major intelligence agencies have been reported in the provided sources to have confirmed that a non-nuclear state, as defined by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has developed and tested a nuclear weapon. However, it is noted that some states not party to the NPT, such as India, Pakistan, and North Korea, have conducted nuclear tests.\n\n- India and Pakistan, which are not NPT signatories, have conducted nuclear tests[2][5].\n- North Korea, which withdrew from the NPT in 2003, has also conducted nuclear tests[2][5].\n\nThese cases involve states that are not considered non-nuclear states under the NPT, as they have either never signed the treaty or have withdrawn from it. There is no mention in the sources of any non-nuclear state, as defined by the NPT, developing and testing a nuclear weapon. Therefore, the answer is \"NO\" based on the provided information.\n\nYES / NO / UNCLEAR: **NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any country not currently possessing nuclear weapons announced or acknowledged that it has developed and tested a nuclear weapon?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been countries that do not currently possess nuclear weapons but have in the past announced or acknowledged developing and testing nuclear weapons, or have been suspected of doing so.\n\n- **South Africa**: Although it is not a current nuclear-armed state, South Africa developed a small number of nuclear weapons during the apartheid era but dismantled its entire nuclear weapons program before joining the NPT in 1991[4].\n\n- **Iraq**: Iraq initiated a secret nuclear program under Saddam Hussein before the 1991 Persian Gulf War, although it did not successfully test a nuclear device[4].\n\n- **Libya**: Libya pursued secret nuclear activities in violation of the NPT terms, but it did not test a nuclear device[4].\n\n- **Syria**: Syria is suspected of having pursued secret nuclear activities, though there has been no public acknowledgment or successful test of a nuclear device[4].\n\n- **Iran**: While Iran has not acknowledged developing or testing a nuclear weapon, it has been involved in nuclear activities that have raised concerns about its intentions. Iran has breached the nuclear restrictions of the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) but maintains it does not intend to pursue nuclear weapons[4].",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 48 days remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** The outcome would be **NO**, as no new nuclear-armed state has currently emerged according to the resolution criteria.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (12 days):** The probability would be slightly lower due to the even more constrained timeframe, likely approaching **0%**.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left (approximately 6 months):** The probability would be slightly higher but still low, perhaps around **2%**, acknowledging the additional time but considering the complexities involved.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the current geopolitical landscape and the stringent resolution criteria, the emergence of a new nuclear-armed state before January 1, 2025, is highly unlikely. Here's the detailed reasoning:\n\n1. **Current Status of Potential Proliferators:**\n   - **Iran:** While Iran has advanced its uranium enrichment activities, there is no credible evidence that it has developed or tested a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) continues to monitor Iran's nuclear program, and any significant developments would likely be detected and reported. Additionally, Iran has not withdrawn from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n   - **Saudi Arabia:** There is no significant evidence indicating that Saudi Arabia is pursuing nuclear weapons or is close to testing one. Saudi Arabia remains a party to the NPT and is subject to IAEA safeguards.\n   - **Other Countries:** No other non-nuclear states have shown indications of developing and testing nuclear weapons imminently. Countries like South Korea, Japan, or others have the technological capability but lack the political will or necessity to pursue nuclear weapons within this short timeframe.\n\n2. **Detection and Verification Mechanisms:**\n   - **International Monitoring Systems:** The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) operates a global monitoring network capable of detecting nuclear tests. A clandestine test would likely be detected, and widespread international consensus would follow.\n   - **Intelligence Agencies:** Major intelligence agencies have not reported any non-nuclear state developing and testing a nuclear weapon recently.\n   - **Diplomatic Acknowledgments:** No country has announced or acknowledged the development and testing of a nuclear weapon.\n\n3. **Time Constraints:**\n   - **Development Timeframe:** Developing and testing a nuclear weapon is a complex process requiring significant time, resources, and technical expertise. Achieving this within the next 48 days is highly improbable.\n   - **Evidence Emergence:** Even if a country were to develop and test a nuclear weapon secretly, the emergence of credible evidence as per the resolution criteria within this short period is unlikely.\n\n4. **Nonproliferation Efforts:**\n   - **Treaty Obligations:** Non-nuclear states are bound by the NPT, and withdrawing or violating it would attract immediate international attention.\n   - **Global Security Dynamics:** The international community, including major powers and organizations, actively works to prevent nuclear proliferation.\n\n5. **Historical Precedence:**\n   - **Past Proliferation Cases:** Previous instances of nuclear proliferation involved prolonged periods of development and were subject to international scrutiny. Rapid, undetected development and testing in the current era are unprecedented.\n\n6. **Remaining Uncertainties:**\n   - **Black Swan Events:** While highly unlikely, unforeseen events could theoretically alter the situation. However, given the lack of any indicators, these possibilities are minimal.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability of a new nuclear-armed state emerging and being confirmed before January 1, 2025, is extremely low.\n\n**Probability: 1%**",
