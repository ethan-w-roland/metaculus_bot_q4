    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the United Nations have exactly 193 member states on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-14\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve positively if the official number of United Nations member states is exactly 193 on December 31, 2024 when checked by Metaculus. It will resolve negatively if the number of member states is not 193. The mechanism of checking will be to access [this specific link](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states) from the UN. The Admin resolving the question will hit control-F and count the number of instances of \"Date of Admission\" on the page. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf the United Nations as an organization ceases to exist before the resolution date, this question will be annulled. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of July 2024, the United Nations has 193 member states. This question asks whether that number will increase before the start of 2026.\n\nJoining the UN requires a recommendation from the Security Council and a two-thirds majority vote in the General Assembly. The process of admitting new members to the UN is generally slow and deliberate, reflecting the organization's role in recognizing sovereign states on the global stage.\n\nPotential candidates for UN membership include:\n\n1. Palestine: Currently a non-member observer state.\n2. Kosovo: Partially recognized, but not a UN member.\n3. Taiwan: Though it functions as an independent state, its UN membership is complicated by China's position.\n4. South Ossetia and Abkhazia: Breakaway regions from Georgia with limited recognition.\n5. Northern Cyprus: Only recognized by Turkey.\n\nAdditionally, new states could potentially emerge through independence movements or the dissolution of existing states.\n\nFactors to consider when forecasting:\n\n- Historical rate of UN membership growth (e.g., the last new member, South Sudan, joined in 2011)\n- Current geopolitical tensions and conflicts\n- Ongoing independence movements\n- Diplomatic efforts of aspiring member states\n- The veto power of permanent Security Council members\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the United Nations will have exactly 193 member states on December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Membership\nAs of November 2024, the United Nations has 193 member states[1][3][5].\n\n## Process of Admission\nFor a new state to join the UN, it must be recommended by the United Nations Security Council and then admitted by a decision of the General Assembly. This process can take some time and involves several steps, including the submission of an application, consideration by the Security Council, and a vote by the General Assembly[3][5].\n\n## Recent Changes\nThe last state to join the UN was South Sudan in 2011. There have been no recent additions or withdrawals from membership since then[5].\n\n## Potential for Change\nGiven the time required for the admission process, it is unlikely that a new state would be admitted between November 2024 and December 31, 2024, unless the process is already well underway. Similarly, the expulsion or suspension of a member state, which would also change the number of members, is a rare and complex process that has never resulted in the expulsion of a member state[5].\n\n## Conclusion\nBased on the current information and the typical timeframe for membership changes, it is highly likely that the United Nations will still have exactly 193 member states on December 31, 2024. However, this cannot be guaranteed with absolute certainty without knowing of any ongoing or imminent membership applications or actions by the Security Council and General Assembly.\n\nFor a superforecaster, key considerations include:\n- **Base Rate**: The UN has had a stable membership count since the last addition in 2011.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The process for admitting new members or expelling existing ones is lengthy and rarely results in changes within a short period.\n- **Current State**: No recent changes or imminent applications have been reported.\n- **Reference Classes**: Historical data shows that changes in UN membership are infrequent and typically do not occur within a few weeks or months.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any new countries been admitted to the United Nations since July 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information indicating that any new countries have been admitted to the United Nations since July 2024. The sources discuss the current membership and recent historical admissions, but they do not mention any new admissions after July 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the UN Security Council recommended any new member states for admission as of November 14, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the UN Security Council has recommended any new member states for admission as of November 14, 2024. The most recent information on this topic is from April 2024, where the Security Council failed to recommend Palestine for full UN membership due to a veto by the United States[5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any UN member state announced its intention to withdraw from the United Nations as of November 14, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that any UN member state has announced its intention to withdraw from the United Nations as of November 14, 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss various topics such as the UN's response to political developments, the role of UNRWA, and other international issues, but they do not mention any member state announcing an intention to withdraw from the UN[1][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Palestine been admitted as a full member state of the United Nations as of November 14, 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nAs of November 14, 2024, Palestine has not been admitted as a full member state of the United Nations. Despite significant support from the General Assembly and various attempts, Palestine's bid for full membership was blocked by a United States veto in the Security Council[3][4].\n\nPalestine currently maintains the status of a non-Member Observer State, with some additional rights and privileges granted by the General Assembly, but it does not have the full rights and privileges of a UN member state[2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any current UN member state ceased to exist or been dissolved as of November 14, 2024?\nANSWER: No, as of November 14, 2024, there are no current UN member states that have ceased to exist or been dissolved. While some original member states have undergone name changes, mergers, or dissolutions in the past, all current member states are still recognized as sovereign entities by the UN.\n\nFor example, the Soviet Union dissolved and its seat was transferred to the Russian Federation, and Yugoslavia dissolved into several successor states, but these changes occurred in the past and do not reflect any current dissolutions[4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major geopolitical events expected to change UN membership before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is a significant geopolitical event related to the potential change in UN membership that is expected to unfold before December 31, 2024.\n\nThe General Assembly has adopted a resolution that, as of September 10, 2024, upgrades Palestine’s rights at the United Nations as an observer State and urges the Security Council to favorably consider its full membership. This resolution, while not immediately granting full membership, sets a process in motion that could lead to further actions towards Palestine's full membership in the UN[1][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any existing UN member state been suspended or expelled from the United Nations as of November 14, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 14, 2024, no existing UN member state has been suspended or expelled from the United Nations. Here are the relevant points from the sources:\n\n- No state has ever been expelled from the UN, despite attempts and discussions about expelling states like South Africa for its apartheid policies and more recently, Israel for its actions in the Palestinian territories[1][4][5].\n- The only historical precedent similar to suspension was the General Assembly's vote to suspend South Africa from participation in its work in 1974, but this was not a formal suspension under the UN Charter[1][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the UN General Assembly scheduled a vote on the admission of a new member state before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: YES, the UN General Assembly has already held a vote related to the admission of a new member state, although it does not grant full membership immediately. On May 10, 2024, the General Assembly adopted a resolution that upgrades Palestine’s rights at the United Nations and urges the Security Council to favourably consider Palestine’s full membership. However, this resolution does not admit Palestine as a full member state but rather grants additional rights and privileges as an observer state, effective from the 79th session of the General Assembly[4].\n\nWhile this does not constitute a vote for full membership, it is a step in that direction and was held before December 31, 2024. The actual decision on full membership would still need a recommendation from the Security Council and a subsequent vote by the General Assembly, which has not been scheduled as of the provided sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been significant progress in Kosovo's bid for UN membership as of November 14, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 14, 2024, there has been no significant progress in Kosovo's bid for UN membership. Here are the key points:\n\n- Kosovo's status within the UN remains unchanged, with it still not recognized as a member state. UN Security Council Resolution 1244 continues to treat Kosovo as part of Serbia under international administration[3][4].\n- While Kosovo has made progress in joining other international organizations, such as the Council of Europe, this does not equate to UN membership[2][3].\n- The UN General Assembly and Security Council requirements for membership, including the need for a two-thirds majority in the General Assembly and approval by the Security Council, where China and Russia hold veto power, remain significant hurdles[3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there currently any country in the process of being admitted to the United Nations as a member state as of November 14, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 14, 2024, the State of Palestine is still in the process of seeking admission as a full member state of the United Nations, but it has not yet been admitted.\n\n- The Palestinian application for UN membership has been under consideration since 2011, and recent developments include a veto by the United States in the Security Council on April 18, 2024, which blocked the recommendation for Palestine's full membership[5].\n- Despite this, the General Assembly has adopted a resolution urging the Security Council to favorably consider Palestine's full membership, but this does not constitute an admission[3].\n\nTherefore, while Palestine's application is still being considered and discussed, it is not yet a member state.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as there is no clear indication of any other country currently in the process of admission, and Palestine's status is still pending).",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome:**\n\nFrom November 14, 2024, to December 31, 2024, there are **47 days** remaining until the outcome is determined.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changes between now and December 31, 2024, the United Nations will have **exactly 193 member states** on that date.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about **12 days** left until December 31, 2024, the likelihood of a change in UN membership would be even lower due to the limited time frame. I would forecast a slightly higher probability that the UN will have exactly 193 member states.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **188 days** left (about six months), the potential for changes in UN membership would be marginally higher, but still low given the lengthy and complex admission process. I would forecast a slightly lower probability compared to the current forecast.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**Base Rate and Historical Context:**\n\n- The United Nations has maintained a stable membership of 193 states since **South Sudan joined in 2011**.\n- Historically, changes in UN membership occur infrequently. The **average rate** of new admissions has slowed considerably in recent decades.\n- The admission process is **lengthy and complex**, often taking months or years to complete.\n\n**Admission Process:**\n\n- Admission requires:\n  - A **recommendation** from the **UN Security Council**.\n  - Approval by a **two-thirds majority** in the **UN General Assembly**.\n- Any of the **five permanent members** of the Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) can **veto** a recommendation.\n\n**Current Candidates and Obstacles:**\n\n1. **Palestine:**\n   - **Status:** Non-member observer state.\n   - **Recent Developments:**\n     - In **April 2024**, the **United States vetoed** a Security Council resolution recommending Palestine for full membership.\n     - Without Security Council recommendation, the General Assembly cannot proceed to a membership vote.\n   - **Likelihood:** Low, due to US opposition and the short time frame.\n\n2. **Kosovo:**\n   - **Status:** Partially recognized state.\n   - **Obstacles:**\n     - **Russia and China** oppose Kosovo's membership and can exercise their veto power.\n   - **Likelihood:** Low, with no significant progress reported.\n\n3. **Others (Taiwan, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Northern Cyprus):**\n   - Face significant political obstacles and lack widespread international recognition.\n   - **Likelihood:** Extremely low within the given time frame.\n\n**Potential for Member Withdrawal or Suspension:**\n\n- No current UN member state has announced an intention to **withdraw** from the UN.\n- **Suspension or expulsion** of a member is unprecedented and highly unlikely in the immediate future.\n- **Dissolution** of existing states within 47 days is improbable.\n\n**Time Frame Considerations:**\n\n- With **47 days remaining**, the window for a change in membership is very narrow.\n- The admission process involves:\n  - Application submission.\n  - Security Council deliberations and voting.\n  - General Assembly scheduling and voting.\n- Completing these steps within this period is highly unlikely.\n\n**Impact of Reduced or Extended Time:**\n\n- **Reduced Time (12 days):**\n  - Even less opportunity for any change.\n  - Probability of no change would be marginally higher.\n\n- **Extended Time (188 days):**\n  - Slightly more opportunity for developments.\n  - However, given the lack of current progress, significant changes remain unlikely.\n  - Probability of no change would be marginally lower, but still high.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the historical stability of UN membership counts, the complexities of the admission process, the geopolitical obstacles facing potential candidates, and the short time frame remaining until December 31, 2024, it is **highly probable** that the United Nations will have exactly **193 member states** on that date.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 98%**",
