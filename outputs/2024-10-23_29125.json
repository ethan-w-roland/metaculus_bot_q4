{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill rapper 50 Cent endorse Donald Trump in the 2024 election before November 5, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-23\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if rapper 50 Cent (Curtis James Jackson III) endorses Donald Trump, according to the Wikipedia page [List of Donald Trump 2024 presidential campaign endorsements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign_endorsements) or credible sources in case of other reporting that is not yet reflected on the Wikipedia page. If there is no such public endorsement, this question resolves as **No**. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent): \"Jackson endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[242] He rejected an offer of $500,000 from the Trump campaign to make an appearance on the candidate's behalf.[243] However, he endorsed Donald Trump in 2020, due to his dislike of Joe Biden's tax plans.[244] A week later, he retracted his endorsement, saying on Twitter \"F--k Donald Trump, I never liked him\",[245] and endorsed Biden.[246]\n\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of 50 Cent endorsing Donald Trump in the 2024 election, here are some key points from the available information:\n\n## Historical Context and Previous Statements\n- 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson, has had a complex and often contradictory relationship with Donald Trump. In the past, he has both expressed support and criticism for Trump. For example, in October 2020, he initially suggested voting for Trump due to tax concerns but later recanted his support.\n\n## Recent Statements and Actions\n- Despite the recent surge in attention to 50 Cent's music following the assassination attempt on Trump, 50 Cent has not publicly declared his support for Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. He has mentioned that he sees some Black men identifying with Trump, particularly due to Trump's own legal challenges under the RICO Act, but this does not necessarily imply an endorsement from 50 Cent himself.\n- 50 Cent has stated that he plans to stay out of the 2024 presidential election and has decided not to attend the Republican National Convention (RNC) to focus on other projects.\n\n## Current Stance\n- There is no clear indication from recent interviews or social media posts that 50 Cent intends to endorse Trump. Instead, he has maintained a stance of not getting involved in the election.\n\nGiven this information, it is unlikely that 50 Cent will endorse Donald Trump in the 2024 election before November 5, 2024, as he has explicitly stated his intention to stay out of the election and has not shown any recent signs of changing this stance. However, the answer is not definitively \"no\" since public figures can change their positions, but based on current information, an endorsement seems improbable.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has 50 Cent stated that he intends to stay out of endorsing any candidate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election?\nANSWER: YES, 50 Cent has stated that he intends to stay out of endorsing any candidate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
