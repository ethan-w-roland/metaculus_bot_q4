    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Federal Register list 3 or more executive orders by President Joe Biden for November 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-12\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Federal Register, which can be accessed [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2024), lists â‰¥3 executive orders for President Joe Biden for the month of November 2024. If it lists >0, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Joe Biden's executive orders and actions](https://ballotpedia.org/Joe_Biden%27s_executive_orders_and_actions)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the Federal Register will list 3 or more executive orders by President Joe Biden for November 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Data\nAs of the current data available, President Joe Biden has signed a total of 13 executive orders in 2024, as listed from EO 14115 through EO 14127. However, this information does not specify the distribution of these orders across different months[5].\n\n## Monthly Distribution\nThe Federal Register does not provide real-time or predictive data on future executive orders. The listing of executive orders is retrospective, meaning it reflects orders that have already been signed and published.\n\n## Access and Updates\nThe Federal Register updates its records as new documents are published. However, due to the access restrictions mentioned, real-time monitoring might be challenging without the necessary IP access or developer APIs[2][4][5].\n\n## Prediction Challenges\nGiven that the data on future executive orders is not publicly available and the Federal Register only reflects past actions, predicting the exact number of executive orders for a specific month like November 2024 is speculative. It depends on various factors, including the President's agenda, legislative and administrative needs, and other unforeseen events.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the available information, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the Federal Register will list 3 or more executive orders by President Joe Biden for November 2024. The answer would require knowledge of future actions that are not yet published or publicly known.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any public statements by President Biden indicating an intention to use executive orders more frequently in the future?\nANSWER: There are no public statements or indications in the provided sources that suggest President Biden has explicitly stated an intention to use executive orders more frequently in the future. The sources discuss specific executive orders and their contents, but they do not include any statements from President Biden about his future use of executive orders.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a historical trend of U.S. presidents issuing fewer executive orders during November of an election year?\nANSWER: There is no specific data or analysis provided in the sources that addresses the historical trend of U.S. presidents issuing executive orders specifically during November of an election year. The sources discuss the general use and limitations of executive orders, the total number of executive orders issued by various presidents, and the types of actions that can be taken through executive orders, but they do not provide a detailed breakdown of the timing of these orders in relation to election years.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether there is a historical trend of U.S. presidents issuing fewer executive orders during November of an election year is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 2023, are there major policy initiatives that President Biden has been unable to pass through Congress?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, there are indeed major policy initiatives that President Biden has been unable to pass through Congress. One notable example is the call for bipartisan data privacy legislation to protect all Americans, especially children, which is mentioned in the Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence. The Executive Order directs the President to call on Congress to pass this legislation, indicating that it has not yet been passed[2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous U.S. presidents issued 3 or more executive orders in November of a presidential election year?\nANSWER: To determine if previous U.S. presidents have issued 3 or more executive orders in November of a presidential election year, we need to examine the historical data on executive orders.\n\nWhile the sources provided do not specifically break down the issuance of executive orders by month, they do offer comprehensive lists and statistics on executive orders issued by various presidents. However, without the specific monthly breakdown, we cannot definitively say how many executive orders were issued in November of any given presidential election year.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden issued 3 or more executive orders in any November months during his presidency up to October 2023?\nANSWER: To determine if President Joe Biden has issued three or more executive orders in any November month during his presidency up to October 2023, we need to examine the specific executive orders issued in November.\n\nFrom the sources provided, here are the relevant executive orders issued in November:\n\n- **Executive Order 14051**: Issued on October 31, 2021, but published on November 3, 2021[5].\n- **Executive Order 14052**: Issued on November 15, 2021, and published on November 18, 2021[5].\n- **Executive Order 14053**: Issued on November 15, 2021, and published on November 18, 2021[5].\n\nIn November 2021, President Biden issued at least three executive orders (14051, 14052, and 14053).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden frequently used executive orders to implement policy changes during his presidency up to October 2023?\nANSWER: While the sources provided do not offer a comprehensive overview of all the executive orders issued by President Joe Biden up to October 2023, they do indicate that he has used executive orders to implement significant policy changes.\n\nFor instance, the executive order on artificial intelligence discussed in the sources is described as a \"landmark\" and \"sweeping\" action, indicating a substantial use of executive authority to shape policy in a critical area[1][3][5].\n\nHowever, to determine if this is a frequent practice, we would need a broader context or a comprehensive list of all executive orders issued by President Biden during his presidency. Since the provided sources focus specifically on the AI executive order and do not provide a general tally or frequency of his use of executive orders, the answer to whether he has frequently used executive orders remains unclear based on the given information.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden issued an average of 3 or more executive orders per month during his presidency up to October 2023?\nANSWER: To determine if President Joe Biden has issued an average of 3 or more executive orders per month during his presidency up to October 2023, we need to calculate the total number of executive orders issued and divide it by the number of months.\n\nAs of May 9, 2023, President Biden had signed 118 executive orders[5].\n\nGiven that Joe Biden took office on January 20, 2021, and considering the period up to October 2023, we calculate the number of months:\n\n- From January 2021 to October 2023 is approximately 32 months.\n\nNow, we divide the total number of executive orders by the number of months:\n\n\\[ \\frac{118 \\text{ executive orders}}{32 \\text{ months}} \\approx 3.69 \\text{ executive orders per month} \\]\n\nSince 3.69 is greater than 3, we can conclude that President Joe Biden has issued an average of more than 3 executive orders per month during his presidency up to October 2023.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there legal challenges pending as of October 2023 that might restrict President Biden's ability to issue executive orders?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, there are no specific mentions in the provided sources of pending legal challenges that directly target President Biden's ability to issue executive orders in general. However, there are discussions about potential legal challenges to specific executive orders and policies, such as the challenge to the project labor agreement (PLA) mandate under Executive Order 14063[4].\n\nThe sources do not indicate any broad or general legal challenges to the president's authority to issue executive orders themselves. Therefore, the answer to whether there are legal challenges pending that might restrict President Biden's ability to issue executive orders in general is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden's rate of issuing executive orders changed significantly in 2023 compared to previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the available information, it is unclear whether President Joe Biden's rate of issuing executive orders has changed significantly in 2023 compared to previous years.\n\nWhile the sources provide a list of executive orders issued by President Biden, including those in 2023, they do not offer a comprehensive comparison of the rate of issuance across different years. For example, the list on Wikipedia shows the cumulative number of executive orders but does not provide a year-by-year breakdown that would allow for a direct comparison of the rate of issuance in 2023 versus previous years[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any scheduled expirations of significant policies or programs in late 2024 that would require executive action?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several significant policies and programs scheduled to expire in late 2024 that would require congressional or executive action to continue:\n\n## Medicare and Health Care Extenders\n- Various Medicare and human services extenders, including telehealth coverage and the Acute Hospital Care at Home Waiver, are set to expire at the end of 2024 if Congress does not pass legislation to extend them[1][3].\n\n## Medicaid Policies\n- Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital cuts and other Medicaid policies have been delayed through the end of 2024, but will require further action to continue beyond this date[3].\n\n## Farm Bill Programs\n- The 2018 farm bill authorities, including crop insurance, nutrition programs such as SNAP, and agricultural research and conservation programs, are extended through the end of FY 2024. If not reauthorized, these programs could face significant changes or cessation of operations starting January 1, 2025[5].\n\n## National Flood Insurance Program\n- The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) authorization is extended through the end of FY 2024 and will need to be reauthorized to continue beyond this date[3].\n\n## Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\n- The authorization for TANF and related programs is extended through the end of FY 2024 and will require further action to continue[3].\n\nThese expirations highlight the need for legislative or executive actions to ensure the continuation of these programs beyond 2024.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nToday is November 12, 2024. The outcome will be known shortly after November 30, 2024, once the Federal Register lists all executive orders signed during November. Therefore, there are approximately 18 days left until the outcome is determined.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and the end of November, the outcome would depend on the number of executive orders already issued and listed for November 2024. If fewer than 3 executive orders have been issued so far in November, and no additional orders are issued, the question would resolve as **No**. Conversely, if 3 or more have already been issued, it would resolve as **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about 4-5 days left in November, the likelihood of additional executive orders being issued would be lower due to the limited time. My forecast would lean more heavily on the number of orders already issued. If fewer than 3 executive orders had been issued by that point, I would decrease the probability of reaching 3 or more.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately 72 days left (extending into early February 2025), the probability of 3 or more executive orders being listed for November 2024 would not change significantly, as the question specifically concerns executive orders issued in November 2024. However, with more time before November, there could be developments influencing the likelihood of executive orders being issued during that month, so I might adjust the probability slightly higher to account for increased uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Averages:** President Biden has averaged over 3 executive orders per month during his presidency up to October 2023. This suggests a baseline probability leaning towards the issuance of 3 or more executive orders in any given month.\n\n- **Election Year Dynamics:** November 2024 is a presidential election month. Historically, presidents issue fewer executive orders during election months due to the focus on campaigning and the election itself. Additionally, if President Biden is running for re-election, his attention may be occupied with the campaign.\n\n- **Lame-Duck Period:** If the election results in a change of administration or shifts in congressional power, there may be an increase in executive orders during the lame-duck period (after the election but before the new administration takes office) in December and January, rather than November.\n\n- **Policy Initiatives:** As identified in the background, there are significant policies set to expire at the end of 2024. This could motivate the issuance of executive orders to address urgent matters, but these actions might occur closer to the expiration dates or require legislative action instead.\n\n- **No Indications of Increased Executive Order Use:** There are no clear statements from President Biden indicating an intention to significantly increase the use of executive orders during this period.\n\n- **Uncertainty Factors:** External events (e.g., emergencies, international developments) could prompt unexpected executive actions.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a reasonable chance that President Biden will issue 3 or more executive orders in November 2024, the unique circumstances of an election month slightly decrease that likelihood compared to an average month.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 55%**",
