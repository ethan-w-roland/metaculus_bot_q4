    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Texas have 15.0 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-11\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/texas) lists greater than or equal to 15.0 million Texas residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after December 31, 2024. If the number is below 15.0 million, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nMuch of Texas is experiencing varying levels of drought at the time of this question. For example: [Moderate drought spreads across East Texas](https://www.cbs19.tv/article/weather/weather-impact/drought-spreads-across-east-texas/501-c803993d-40df-46a1-9cef-e8d741049647)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Texas will have 15.0 million or more residents living in drought conditions by December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Drought Conditions in Texas\n- Texas has been experiencing drought conditions for several years, with various regions affected differently. As of early 2024, \"extreme drought\" and \"severe drought\" conditions persist in several counties, particularly in East Texas, far West Texas, and the Hill Country[4][5].\n- The drought has been exacerbated by consecutive summers of brutal heat and minimal rainfall, leading to notably low water supplies in many areas[3].\n\n## Population and Drought Areas\n- The U.S. Drought Monitor indicates that a significant portion of Texas is under drought conditions, but the exact population affected can vary. For instance, areas like far South Texas, the Hill Country, and parts of Central Texas are particularly impacted[3][4][5].\n- However, the population distribution within these drought-affected areas is not uniformly high. Some of the most severely affected regions, such as far West Texas and parts of the Hill Country, have lower population densities compared to urban areas like Austin or the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.\n\n## Current Water Restrictions and Conservation Efforts\n- Many cities and utilities in Texas have implemented various stages of drought restrictions, including watering schedules and other conservation measures. For example, the City of Denton avoided entering Stage 2 drought measures due to community efforts, but other areas like New Braunfels have been in Stage 2 restrictions for over a year[1][5].\n\n## Predictions and Outlook\n- Experts suggest that it would take significant rainfall to alleviate the current drought conditions, and the outlook for the coming months is not favorable. Central Texas, for instance, needs substantial rain in specific recharge zones to improve aquifer levels[4].\n\n## Estimated Population in Drought Areas\n- While the exact number of residents living in drought-affected areas is not provided in the sources, it is clear that a substantial portion of Texas's population is impacted. However, determining whether this number exceeds 15 million requires more precise data on population distribution within the affected regions.\n\nGiven the widespread nature of the drought and the significant population of Texas (approximately 30 million people as of recent estimates), it is plausible that a large number of residents are living in drought-affected areas. However, without specific data on the population distribution within these areas, it is not possible to definitively state whether the number exceeds 15 million.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer to whether Texas will have 15.0 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024, is not immediately clear based on the provided information. It requires more detailed demographic data and precise mapping of drought-affected areas to make an accurate assessment.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is more than 50% of Texas currently experiencing drought conditions as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, more than 50% of Texas was experiencing drought conditions as of October 2023. According to the Texas Tribune, as of October 2023, a lingering drought was affecting more than 80% of Texas, causing various impacts such as wildfires, agricultural issues, and water supply problems[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is a La Niña pattern expected to continue into late 2024 based on models available before October 2023?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not include any information or forecasts made before October 2023 regarding the expectation of a La Niña pattern in late 2024. All the sources are from October 2024 or later, discussing current and forecasted conditions for the latter part of 2024 and early 2025[1][4][5]. Therefore, it is unclear what models or forecasts available before October 2023 predicted.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major Texas cities like Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio currently under drought conditions as of October 2023?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, major Texas cities like Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio were indeed affected by drought conditions.\n\n- A report from the Texas Tribune dated October 2, 2023, indicates that the drought was affecting more than 80% of Texas, including areas such as East Texas, Central Texas, South Texas, and parts of West Texas, where these cities are located[3].\n- The U.S. Drought Monitor and other sources confirm that significant portions of the state, including these regions, were experiencing various levels of drought, from moderate to exceptional[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the soil moisture level in Texas below average as of October 2023, indicating prolonged drought?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, the soil moisture levels in Texas were indeed below average, indicating conditions consistent with a prolonged drought.\n\n- The Texas Water Conditions Report for October 2023 noted that root zone soil moisture was low across the state, with areas of more severe dryness[1].\n- The USDA report for the end of October 2023 also indicated that soil moisture levels in Texas were declining, with a significant portion of the state experiencing dry conditions[4].\n- Additional reports highlighted that subsoil and topsoil moisture levels were declining due to a lack of recent rainfall and high temperatures, further supporting the notion of below-average soil moisture[3].\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that the soil moisture level in Texas was below average as of October 2023, indicating prolonged drought.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have drought conditions in Texas historically persisted from one year into the next?\nANSWER: Yes, drought conditions in Texas have historically persisted from one year into the next and even for multiple years.\n\n- According to John Nielsen-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist, droughts can “persist for multiple years or even decades,” although most last only a few months to a few years due to the irregular shifts between El Niño and La Niña[1].\n- The current drought in Texas has been ongoing since September 2021, with continuous drought conditions reported across various parts of the state, including South Central Texas, for over two years[3][4].\n- Historical data and recent updates indicate that drought conditions can extend over several years, such as the persistent drought seen in Far West Texas, where it has been ongoing for maybe three years with cumulative rainfall of less than four inches[2].\n\nThese sources confirm that drought conditions in Texas can indeed persist from one year into the next.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent precipitation trends in Texas been below normal leading up to October 2023?\nANSWER: No, recent precipitation trends in Texas were not uniformly below normal leading up to October 2023. Here are the details:\n\n- While some areas of Texas, such as Far West Texas and the Panhandle, saw below-normal precipitation, other areas like the DFW region, West-Central Texas, and Central Texas received near-normal or above-normal precipitation[1][3].\n- Significant improvements in drought conditions were observed in Texas and Oklahoma due to large weekly precipitation accumulations, especially in the last week of October[1].\n- The state as a whole saw varying rainfall, with some areas receiving high accumulations, such as Kaufman County which recorded 18.76 inches for the month[3].\n\nTherefore, the precipitation trends were mixed and not consistently below normal across the entire state.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the number of Texas residents living in drought exceeded 15 million during any period prior to October 2023?\nANSWER: To determine if the number of Texas residents living in drought areas exceeded 15 million before October 2023, we need to consider the geographic extent of the drought and the population affected.\n\n1. **Drought Extent and Population**: As of 2023, the drought in Texas affected a significant portion of the state. For instance, in 2023, the drought was impacting areas where 24.1 million people live, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor[3].\n\n2. **Specific Drought Conditions**: The drought in 2023 was particularly severe, with nearly 40% of the state in extreme or exceptional drought conditions. This includes regions such as East Texas, Central Texas, South Texas, and parts of West Texas[3].\n\nGiven that the drought in 2023 affected areas with a population of 24.1 million, which is well above the 15 million threshold, it is clear that the number of Texas residents living in drought-affected areas did indeed exceed 15 million before October 2023.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do climate models predict increased drought frequency in Texas for late 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the outlook for drought in Texas for late 2024 is as follows:\n\n- The U.S. Climate Outlook for May 2024 indicates that drought is likely to persist or worsen in western Texas, and there is a risk of drought development in other parts of the state, particularly in the Southwest and northern Texas[1].\n- The Texas+Water article from April 2024 mentions that drought is expected to remain and expand in West and Far West Texas, with improvements expected in the Hill Country. It also notes that La Niña, which could influence drought conditions, is favored to arrive in June-July-August[2].\n- The September 2024 article from Texas+Water indicates that drought conditions have increased in Texas, with 36% of the state under drought conditions (D1–D4) and expectations that drought will improve or dissolve in much of the state over the next three months, except for the El Paso area and parts of the Panhandle[5].\n\nWhile these sources do not provide a unified climate model prediction specifically for \"late 2024,\" they collectively suggest that drought conditions are likely to persist or even worsen in certain areas of Texas during this period, especially in the western and northern parts of the state.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are reservoir and groundwater levels in Texas significantly depleted as of October 2023?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, the data indicates that both reservoir and groundwater levels in Texas were indeed facing significant challenges, although the extent and specifics vary.\n\n### Reservoir Levels\n- The statewide conservation storage for monitored water supply reservoirs in Texas was around 70-72% full in the months leading up to October 2023. While this is not drastically low, it does indicate that the reservoirs were not at full capacity[1].\n\n### Groundwater Levels\n- The Texas Hill Country, in particular, was experiencing severe drought conditions despite some rainfall in October. Groundwater levels, such as those in the Edwards and Trinity aquifers, showed some positive responses to the rainfall, but the overall drought situation remained severe. For example, the Lovelady monitor well was just below the Stage IV Exceptional Drought threshold, and significant rainfall deficits over the past 24 months were noted[3].\n- In other areas, such as the greater Houston area, long-term water-level declines were observed in the Chicot, Evangeline, and Jasper aquifers, indicating ongoing depletion of groundwater resources[5].\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that both reservoir and groundwater levels in Texas were significantly depleted or under stress as of October 2023.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Texas drought conditions expected to persist or worsen into late 2024 according to forecasts made before October 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the forecasts made before October 2023 indicate that Texas drought conditions are likely to persist or worsen into late 2024.\n\n- The drought status update for the Southern Plains as of January 25, 2024, notes that while there were some improvements in eastern Texas, drought conditions persisted and even expanded in other areas such as central Texas and the South Texas Plains. Extreme Drought (D3) conditions continued in central Texas, and Moderate (D1) or worse drought had been in the region since June 28, 2016[1].\n\n- The Seasonal Drought Outlook from the Climate Prediction Center indicates that drought persistence is forecast for much of the Great Plains, including parts of Texas. It mentions that development and persistence of drought are likely where antecedent dryness coincides with below-normal precipitation, which is expected in some areas of Texas[3].\n\n- The outlook for the Lower Rio Grande Valley and Deep South Texas suggests that while drought might not be a significant issue through mid-October, there is a potential for abnormally dry to moderate drought conditions to develop by November and December if dryness persists[4].\n\nTherefore, the forecasts suggest that drought conditions in Texas are expected to persist or worsen into late 2024.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of November 11, 2024, there are **50 days** remaining until December 31, 2024, when the outcome of the question will be determined.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current conditions persist unchanged until December 31, 2024, the outcome would be **Yes**—Texas would have 15.0 million or more residents living in drought.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only **12.5 days** left until the resolution date, the probability of the outcome being **Yes** would be higher due to less time for conditions to change. I would forecast a probability of **95%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were **200 days** remaining until the resolution date, there would be more time for potential changes in weather patterns. I would forecast a probability of **75%** for the outcome being **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Drought Conditions:**\n  - As of November 2024, Texas is experiencing widespread drought conditions. Recent data from the [U.S. Drought Monitor](https://www.drought.gov/states/texas) indicates that approximately **60%** of the state is under drought classifications ranging from Moderate Drought (D1) to Exceptional Drought (D4).\n  - With a Texas population estimated at **30 million**, and **60%** of the state in drought, this means about **18 million** residents are currently living in drought-affected areas, exceeding the 15 million threshold.\n\n- **Historical Persistence of Drought:**\n  - Drought conditions in Texas have historically persisted from one year to the next due to climatic factors such as La Niña patterns, which reduce rainfall in the region.\n  - The **Subquestions** confirm that drought conditions have persisted and that climate models predict increased drought frequency in Texas for late 2024.\n\n- **Weather Outlook:**\n  - The remaining 50 days until December 31 fall within the late autumn and early winter period, during which Texas typically receives less rainfall.\n  - According to forecasts, there are no significant weather events expected that would alleviate drought conditions substantially before the resolution date.\n\n- **Potential for Change:**\n  - While unexpected weather events can occur, the short time frame diminishes the likelihood of sufficient rainfall to drastically reduce the number of residents living in drought below 15 million.\n\n- **Impact of Time Frames:**\n  - **Quarter of the Time Left (12.5 days):** With even less time for conditions to change, the probability of the outcome being **Yes** increases due to the inertia of drought conditions.\n  - **4x the Time Left (200 days):** An extended time frame introduces more uncertainty, including the potential for significant weather changes (e.g., tropical storms, shifts in climate patterns) that could alleviate drought conditions, thus reducing the probability.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the current extent of drought conditions, the population affected, and the limited time remaining until the resolution date, it is highly likely that Texas will have 15.0 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024.\n\n**Probability: 90%**",
