    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Joe Biden sign 2 or more executive orders after Election Day and before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves **Yes** if the number of executive orders signed by President Joe Biden after November 5, 2024, and before January 1, 2025, is 2 or more according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) such as the [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders) and the White House's [Presidential Actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/) portal.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nOnly official [executive orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order) count. Other actions such as memoranda, notices and proclamations do not.\r\n\r\nExecutive orders are counted according to the date they are signed; date published is immaterial.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order): \r\n\r\n>In the United States, an executive order is a directive by the president of the United States that manages operations of the federal government.The legal or constitutional basis for executive orders has multiple sources. Article Two of the United States Constitution gives presidents broad executive and enforcement authority to use their discretion to determine how to enforce the law or to otherwise manage the resources and staff of the executive branch. The ability to make such orders is also based on expressed or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the president some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation)\r\n\r\nIn his final months in office, Joe Biden has signed executive orders on [gun violence](https://baystatebanner.com/2024/10/02/biden-signs-executive-orders-on-gun-violence/) and [labor standards](https://natlawreview.com/article/president-biden-signs-executive-order-directing-agencies-prioritize-pro-union-and).\r\n\r\nSince becoming President, Biden has issued executive orders at the follow count per month:\r\n\r\n| Month            | 2021 | Month            | 2023 |\r\n|-------------------|------|------------------|------|\r\n| January 2021     | 25   | January 2023     | 0    |\r\n| February 2021    | 9    | February 2023    | 1    |\r\n| March 2021       | 3    | March 2023       | 2    |\r\n| April 2021       | 5    | April 2023       | 4    |\r\n| May 2021         | 5    | May 2023         | 2    |\r\n| June 2021        | 5    | June 2023        | 2    |\r\n| July 2021        | 1    | July 2023        | 3    |\r\n| August 2021      | 3    | August 2023      | 2    |\r\n| September 2021   | 9    | September 2023   | 3    |\r\n| October 2021     | 3    | October 2023     | 1    |\r\n| November 2021    | 4    | November 2023    | 1    |\r\n| December 2021    | 6    | December 2023    | 3    |\r\n\r\n| Month            | 2022 | Month            | 2024 |\r\n|-------------------|------|------------------|------|\r\n| January 2022     | 1    | January 2024     | 0    |\r\n| February 2022    | 3    | February 2024    | 3    |\r\n| March 2022       | 4    | March 2024       | 4    |\r\n| April 2022       | 3    | April 2024       | 1    |\r\n| May 2022         | 2    | May 2024         | 0    |\r\n| June 2022        | 1    | June 2024        | 1    |\r\n| July 2022        | 3    | July 2024        | 2    |\r\n| August 2022      | 2    | August 2024      | 0    |\r\n| September 2022   | 4    | September 2024   | 1    |\r\n| October 2022     | 4    | October 2024     | 0    |\r\n| November 2022    | 0    | November 2024    | 1    |\r\n| December 2022    | 2    | December 2024    | ?    |\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Joe Biden signing 2 or more executive orders after Election Day and before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Current Rate of Executive Orders\nAs of September 9, 2024, President Biden had signed only two executive orders since announcing his decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race. This rate is significantly lower than that of his predecessors, Trump and Obama, during similar periods in their presidencies[1].\n\n## Recent Executive Orders\nSince the last update, there has been an additional executive order signed on September 26, 2024, related to combating emerging firearms threats and improving school-based active shooter drills[3].\n\n## Total Executive Orders\nAs of September 26, 2024, President Biden has signed a total of 143 executive orders during his presidency[5].\n\n## Time Frame and Context\nWith just a few weeks left before he steps down, President Biden is in the final stretch of his presidency. There is a suggestion that he might use this period to take significant actions, such as commuting federal death sentences, expediting the allocation of funds from the Inflation Reduction Act, or addressing other unsolved matters through executive orders[4].\n\n## Base Rate and Precedents\nGiven the historical context, it is unusual for a president to significantly increase their rate of executive orders in the final weeks of their term. However, the urgency and the desire to leave a lasting legacy could motivate President Biden to issue more executive orders.\n\n## Forecasting Considerations\n- **Base Rate**: The current rate of executive orders is low, but this does not necessarily predict future behavior.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The time frame is short, with only a few weeks left before January 1, 2025.\n- **Current State**: The president's motivation to leave a lasting legacy and address critical issues before the end of his term could influence his actions.\n- **Reference Classes**: Past presidents have used their final days in office to issue significant executive orders, but the context and political climate can vary.\n\nGiven these points, while it is uncertain whether Biden will sign exactly 2 or more executive orders, the context suggests that he might be inclined to take more actions in his final weeks. However, this cannot be definitively answered as a yes or no without further specific information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any pending executive orders that President Joe Biden is expected to sign in the specified time frame?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any pending executive orders that President Joe Biden is expected to sign in a specified time frame. The sources discuss existing executive orders, particularly those related to AI and other policies, but do not indicate any upcoming or pending executive orders.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden signed at least two executive orders since September 26, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information that confirms President Joe Biden has signed at least two executive orders since September 26, 2024. The sources discuss executive orders and actions up to September 26, 2024, but do not provide details on any executive orders signed after that date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden's administration announced any specific executive orders to be signed after Election Day?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear announcement from President Joe Biden's administration regarding specific executive orders to be signed after Election Day. The sources discuss various executive orders and actions taken by President Biden during his term, but they do not mention any specific plans or announcements for executive orders to be signed after the election.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major policy initiatives that require executive orders from President Joe Biden before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of specific major policy initiatives that President Joe Biden must implement through executive orders before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss various executive actions and policies already implemented or planned by the Biden administration, but they do not specify any urgent or mandatory initiatives that must be completed before January 1, 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden indicated an intention to sign executive orders before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that President Joe Biden has announced or indicated an intention to sign new executive orders specifically before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss his past and current executive actions, as well as speculative actions he might take before the end of his term, but they do not specify any plans for new executive orders before January 1, 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden signed more than one executive order in the month following November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that President Joe Biden signed more than one executive order in the month following November 5, 2024. The sources mention that Biden issued one executive order in November 2024, specifically on November 21, 2024, related to a dispute between New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and its locomotive engineers[2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden signed at least one executive order after November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no evidence of President Joe Biden signing an executive order after November 5, 2024.\n\n- The most recent executive order mentioned in the sources is Executive Order 14128, which was issued on November 21, 2024, to establish a second emergency board to investigate a dispute between New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and its locomotive engineers. This is before November 5 is not relevant, but it is the latest mentioned and does not extend beyond November 21, 2024[3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a trend in President Joe Biden's signing of executive orders in the final weeks of his administration similar to past presidents?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no clear evidence to suggest a specific trend in President Joe Biden's signing of executive orders in the final weeks of his administration that is similar to or distinct from past presidents.\n\nThe sources provided discuss Biden's use of executive orders in general, particularly highlighting his rapid issuance of executive orders at the beginning of his term[3][5], but they do not provide specific information about his actions in the final weeks of his administration.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether there is a trend in President Joe Biden's signing of executive orders in the final weeks of his administration similar to past presidents is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current political climate supportive of President Joe Biden issuing additional executive orders?\nANSWER: The current political climate and the sources provided do not clearly indicate that the climate is supportive of President Joe Biden issuing additional executive orders. Here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Political Transition**: With President Biden set to leave office in January, there is a sense of transition and potential resistance to new executive actions that might conflict with the incoming administration's vision[2][3].\n\n2. **Criticism and Comparison**: President Biden has been criticized for signing fewer executive orders compared to his predecessors, which might suggest a lack of support or momentum for additional executive actions[4].\n\n3. **Administrative Challenges**: There are concerns about the feasibility and funding of new executive orders, especially given the interagency process and the need for congressional support[2].\n\nGiven these points, the support for issuing additional executive orders appears to be uncertain and potentially limited.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any legal or congressional obstacles that could prevent President Joe Biden from signing executive orders in the specified period?\nANSWER: There are several legal and congressional obstacles that could potentially prevent or limit President Joe Biden from signing or enforcing executive orders:\n\n## Legal Obstacles:\n- Executive orders must be supported by the Constitution or by statutes enacted by Congress. If an executive order lacks such support, it can be subject to judicial review and may be overturned by the courts[1][2][4].\n- The U.S. Supreme Court has the authority to review and overturn executive orders if they are deemed to exceed the president's constitutional or statutory authority[1][2].\n\n## Congressional Obstacles:\n- While Congress cannot directly override an executive order with a simple majority, it can take other actions to limit its impact. For example, Congress can cut off funding necessary to implement the order, making it impossible to carry out[2][4].\n- Congress can also pass legislation that contradicts the executive order, although this would require overcoming a potential presidential veto, which would need a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate to override[1][2].\n\n## Other Limitations:\n- Future presidents can amend or rescind executive orders issued by previous presidents, which means that any executive order signed by President Biden could be reversed by a subsequent president[2][4].\n\nIn summary, while President Joe Biden has the authority to sign executive orders, there are significant legal and congressional checks that can limit or overturn these orders. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 25 days remain from December 6, 2024, until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf the current rate of executive orders remains unchanged, it is likely that President Joe Biden will sign **fewer than two executive orders** between Election Day and January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith roughly 6 days left (a quarter of the remaining time), the likelihood of signing two or more executive orders is **very low**, possibly **No**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nIf there were approximately 100 days remaining, there would be a higher probability that President Biden might sign two or more executive orders, potentially increasing the likelihood to around **50%** or higher, depending on political and administrative factors.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAs of December 6, 2024, President Joe Biden has signed at most **one** executive order after Election Day (November 5, 2024). The remaining period until January 1, 2025, is relatively short—about 25 days—which limits the opportunity to issue multiple executive orders. Historically, while some presidents have used their final weeks in office to enact significant executive actions, Biden's recent pattern shows a **low rate** of executive order signings in the final months of his presidency. Additionally, political transitions and potential resistance from the incoming administration may further reduce the likelihood of additional executive orders. The subquestions indicate that as of the latest available information, there is **no clear evidence** of pending executive orders that Biden intends to sign before the end of his term.\n\nConsidering the **base rate** of past behavior, the **current rate** of executive orders, and the **time constraints**, it is reasonable to estimate a **low probability** of Biden signing two or more executive orders in the specified timeframe.\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
