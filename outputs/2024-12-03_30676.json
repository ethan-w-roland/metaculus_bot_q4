    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill be Donald Trump's net favorability rating on December 27, 2024 be less than -6?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-03\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if the net favorability rating of Donald Trump for December 27, 2024, is less than -6, as reported by 538 after that date. The resolution will be based on the already-calculated net rating presented on 538. A higher percentage for \"Unfavorable\" will result in a negative resolution. A higher percentage for \"Favorable\" means that this question will resolve as >0.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf no value for December 27, 2024 has been published until January 7, 2025, the closest values will be used to resolve this question, provided that these are for any date after December 20, 2024 and before January 3, 2025.\r\n\r\nIn that case, the resolution will be calculated as follows: If there is one, unambiguous closest value (e.g., a value for December 26, 2024 is shown on the site but not one for December 28, 2024), the question will resolve as that. If there are two equidistant closest values, then the question will resolve as their average.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/) aggregates polling data from various pollsters to calculate a weighted favorability rating. After winning the US election, Trump's net favorability (% of people that have a favorable opinion - % that have an unfavorable one) has increased from -8.6 on November 4, 2024 to -6 on November 21, the highest score of the previous 4 years.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Donald Trump's net favorability rating on December 27, 2024, will be less than -6, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Favorability Ratings\n- As of recent polls, Donald Trump's favorability ratings have shown significant variation but generally remain divided. For example, an Emerson College poll post-election showed Trump with a 54% approval rating, though this is not directly comparable to net favorability[1].\n- A survey from October 2024 indicated that 44% of Americans had a very unfavorable view of Trump, while 29% had a very favorable view, resulting in a net unfavorable rating[2].\n- FiveThirtyEight's polling averages around mid-November 2024 showed Trump's favorability ranging from 46% to 54% favorable, with corresponding unfavorable ratings that often kept the net favorability close to even or slightly positive[3].\n\n## Recent Trends\n- Post-election, Trump's favorability has seen some increases, particularly among certain demographics like men and younger voters[1].\n- However, his overall net favorability has historically been volatile and often negative. For instance, as of the period before the election, his net favorability was around -8.6%[5].\n\n## Republican Support\n- Trump maintains high favorability among Republicans, with recent polls showing around 79-85% of Republicans holding a favorable view of him[4].\n\n## Predictive Uncertainty\n- Given the variability in polling data and the dynamic nature of public opinion, predicting the exact net favorability rating on a specific date like December 27, 2024, involves significant uncertainty.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, Trump's net favorability has often been negative, but recent trends suggest some improvement post-election.\n- The base rate for Trump's net favorability being less than -6 would typically be high given past data, but current trends might suggest a slight improvement.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The question pertains to a specific date (December 27, 2024), which is relatively close to the current date. This timeframe is short enough that significant changes in public opinion might be limited, but still possible given the volatile nature of political sentiment.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is difficult to predict with certainty whether Trump's net favorability rating will be less than -6 on December 27, 2024, the following points are relevant for a superforecaster:\n- Recent polls show mixed results but generally indicate that Trump's net favorability is close to even or slightly positive.\n- Historical data suggests that Trump's net favorability is often negative, but there has been some improvement post-election.\n- The high variability in polling data and the dynamic nature of public opinion make precise predictions challenging.\n\nGiven these factors, the answer to whether Trump's net favorability rating will be less than -6 on December 27, 2024, is not immediately clear and would require careful consideration of ongoing trends and potential shifts in public opinion.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump released any significant policy initiatives in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of Donald Trump releasing significant policy initiatives in December 2024. The sources discuss anticipated policies and actions for his upcoming second term, but they do not provide details on any policy initiatives released in December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major national security incidents involving the US occurred in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about major national security incidents involving the US that occurred in December 2024. The sources discuss various security threats, cyber incidents, and national security events, but they do not mention any specific incidents in December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump faced any legal challenges or indictments in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided source, it does not specify any legal challenges or indictments against Donald Trump in December 2024. The source discusses pending criminal and civil cases against him as of November 2024 but does not provide information for the month of December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major opinion polls conducted after November 21, 2024, shown a decline in Donald Trump's net favorability?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication of a decline in Donald Trump's net favorability in major opinion polls conducted after November 21, 2024. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The Emerson College poll conducted after the election (November 26, 2024) shows that Trump's favorability rating increased to 54%, a six-point rise from his pre-election favorability of 48%[2].\n- There is no mention in the other sources of a decline in Trump's net favorability post-November 21, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump participated in any high-profile public events between November 21, 2024, and December 27, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence of Donald Trump participating in high-profile public events during the specified period.\n\n- On Thanksgiving, which fell on November 28, 2024, Donald Trump spent the holiday at Mar-a-Lago and was joined by family members and Elon Musk[1].\n- There is also mention of Trump meeting with Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago, although the exact date is not specified in the provided snippets, but it is mentioned in the context of recent events[1].\n\nThese events indicate that Donald Trump has indeed participated in high-profile public or semi-public activities between November 21, 2024, and December 27, 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has media sentiment towards Donald Trump become predominantly negative in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it is unclear whether media sentiment towards Donald Trump has become predominantly negative in December 2024.\n\n- The first source presents opinions from reporters at The Lionâ€™s Roar, which are critical of Trump's victory and policies. However, this does not represent a broad media sentiment but rather the views of specific individuals[1].\n- The second source discusses student sentiment and international students' perceptions, which does not directly address media sentiment towards Trump[2].\n- The third source indicates that business sentiment has improved following Trump's election, but it does not provide information on media sentiment[3].\n\nTherefore, the available sources do not provide sufficient evidence to determine the overall media sentiment towards Donald Trump in December 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Donald Trump maintain a favorability rating above 75% among Republican voters in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no specific data provided for Donald Trump's favorability rating among Republican voters in December 2024. However, the sources do provide insights into his favorability ratings among Republicans in the months leading up to December.\n\nFor example, the FiveThirtyEight data shows that in various polls conducted in November 2024 and earlier, Donald Trump's favorability among Republican voters was consistently high, often above 75%[4].\n\nGiven the lack of specific December 2024 data but the consistent high favorability ratings among Republicans in the preceding months, it is reasonable to infer that his favorability might remain high, but there is no direct evidence to confirm it is above 75% specifically in December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the overall approval rating of the current administration decreased in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the overall approval rating of President Joe Biden's administration has indeed decreased in the period leading up to and including December 2024.\n\n- As of October 2024, Biden's approval rating was 43.1%, but it had slightly decreased from the previous month[1].\n- By November 2024, various polls indicated a further decline. For example, a Gallup poll from November 6-20, 2024, showed Biden's job approval rating had dipped to 37%[3].\n- Another source from November 2024 also reported a decline in Biden's approval ratings, with about 32% of Americans approving of his job performance[4].\n\nGiven these trends, it is reasonable to conclude that the overall approval rating of the current administration has decreased in December 2024, although the exact December figures are not provided in the sources.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant economic downturn in the US economy in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of a significant economic downturn in the US economy specifically in December 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan does not predict a recession in 2024, and instead, expects the economy to continue growing, albeit at a slower rate[2].\n- Deloitte's forecast suggests that while there are risks, the baseline scenario does not indicate a significant economic downturn in December 2024. Instead, it predicts continued growth and a potential cut in interest rates[3].\n- The Conference Board and J.P. Morgan forecasts also do not indicate a significant economic downturn for December 2024, but rather a slowing of growth and potential rate cuts[4][5].\n\nTherefore, based on the available information:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as there is no specific data or prediction for December 2024 indicating a significant economic downturn)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump been involved in any major scandals between November 21, 2024, and December 27, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several incidents and controversies involving Donald Trump between November 21, 2024, and December 3, 2024, that could be considered major scandals or significant controversies:\n\n## Investigation and Prosecution\n- There were reports of a federal appeals court dropping Donald Trump from the special counsel's appeal of his classified documents case, ending his prosecution on federal charges[1].\n\n## Internal Probe\n- Trump had his advisers conduct an internal investigation into alleged claims of impropriety by his top legal adviser, Boris Epshteyn[1].\n\n## Nominee Controversies\n- Trump's DEA nominee, Chad Chronister, withdrew his name from consideration shortly after being nominated, which followed criticism from conservatives over his actions during the COVID-19 pandemic[2].\n\n## Threats and Security Issues\n- The FBI was investigating bomb threats and swatting incidents targeting several of Trump's Cabinet nominees[1].\n\nThese incidents indicate that Donald Trump has been involved in significant controversies and scandals during the specified period.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n24 days (from December 3, 2024, to December 27, 2024).\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf nothing changes, Donald Trump's net favorability rating would remain at approximately -6, as reported on November 21, 2024. Since the question resolves as **Yes** only if the net favorability is less than -6, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 6 days left, the likelihood of significant changes in net favorability is minimal. Assuming no new major events or shifts in public opinion, the forecast would lean towards the current rating holding steady.  \n**Forecast:** 10% probability that the net favorability is less than -6.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nExtending the timeframe to approximately 96 days introduces more uncertainty, allowing for potential shifts in public opinion due to political events, media coverage, or other factors. However, given the current trends and lack of significant negative developments, the probability of the net favorability dropping below -6 remains relatively low.  \n**Forecast:** 15% probability that the net favorability is less than -6.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAs of November 21, 2024, Donald Trump's net favorability rating is -6, showing an improvement from previous measurements. The period between November 21 and December 27 is relatively short (24 days), limiting the potential for significant shifts in public opinion. The subquestions indicate a mix of unclear factors and some negative developments, such as decreased approval of the current administration and involvement in scandals. However, there is no strong evidence of a continued decline in Trump's favorability. Historical data suggests that while Trump's net favorability has often been negative, recent trends post-election indicate stabilization or slight improvement. Given the high variability and dynamic nature of political sentiment, there remains some uncertainty, but the probability that the net favorability drops below -6 is low.\n\n**Probability:** 20%",
