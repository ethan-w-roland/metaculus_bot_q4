    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill 0-3 U.S. federal executive department heads be announced by the incoming administration between the election and December 16, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-08\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the total number of federal executive department heads officially announced as nominees by the new U.S. President-elect or their transition team after November 5, 2024, and before December 16, 2024, is 0-3 out of the total of 15 (listed in the Fine Print) according to credible sources. If a different number of nominees is announced, this question resolves as No.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- If a nominee is announced, it will count for resolution independently of potential retractions or refusals on the part of the nominee.\r\n- Reports that the new president-elect *will* announce an executive department head do not count for the resolution of this question if the announcement itself has not taken place.\r\n- Official announcements that the President-elect intends to retain an incumbent in their position will count for resolution.\r\n- Senate confirmation is not required for this question.\r\n- Only the following 15 [Cabinet positions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-executive-branch/) will affect resolution:\r\n    - Secretary of State\r\n    - Secretary of the Treasury\r\n    - Secretary of Defense\r\n    - Attorney General\r\n    - Secretary of the Interior\r\n    - Secretary of Agriculture\r\n    - Secretary of Commerce\r\n    - Secretary of Labor\r\n    - Secretary of Health and Human Services\r\n    - Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\r\n    - Secretary of Transportation\r\n    - Secretary of Energy\r\n    - Secretary of Education\r\n    - Secretary of Veterans Affairs\r\n    - Secretary of Homeland Security\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFollowing presidential elections in the U.S., new or re-elected presidents announce changes to [the cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States) as part of their transition or continued administration. The Cabinet has 26 members: the vice president, 15 federal executive department heads, and 10 Cabinet-level officials.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the department heads usually happen in the first 10 weeks following election day, but vary in terms of specific timingâ€”from Nixon in 1968 who announced all positions in the six weeks following election day, to Biden in 2020 who announced the three final positions on January 7, 2021 (approximately nine weeks following election day).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of 0-3 U.S. federal executive department heads being announced by the incoming administration between the election and December 16, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Transition Process\nAfter a presidential election, the transition process involves the incoming administration preparing to take office. This includes nominating and announcing candidates for various positions, including the heads of the federal executive departments. The transition period is typically busy, with many announcements made in the weeks following the election.\n\n## Confirmation Process\nThe heads of the executive departments must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. This process can be time-consuming, but announcements of nominees can occur quickly after the election. The Senate's schedule and the urgency of filling key positions can influence how rapidly these announcements are made.\n\n## Historical Precedent\nIn previous transitions, incoming administrations have often made several key announcements in the weeks immediately following the election. For example, in the transition from the Obama to the Trump administration, and from the Trump to the Biden administration, several cabinet nominees were announced within a few weeks of the election.\n\n## Current Context\nGiven the current political landscape and the timing of the election, it is plausible that the incoming administration would announce at least a few key cabinet positions before December 16, 2024. The need to establish a functional government and the political imperative to demonstrate readiness can drive these early announcements.\n\n## Base Rates\nHistorically, incoming administrations have typically announced several cabinet nominees in the period between the election and the inauguration. This suggests a high likelihood of at least some announcements being made during this time frame.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on historical precedent, the transition process, and the need for the incoming administration to establish its leadership quickly, it is likely that more than zero but potentially fewer than three federal executive department heads will be announced between the election and December 16, 2024. However, the exact number cannot be predicted with certainty without specific information about the incoming administration's plans and the Senate's schedule.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any past U.S. elections resulted in delayed cabinet announcements due to contested results?\nANSWER: Yes, past U.S. elections have resulted in delayed cabinet announcements due to contested results.\n\nOne notable example is the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore. The election was contested, and it took five weeks for the Supreme Court to settle the dispute, leaving Bush with only about half the usual time to manage the transition from the Clinton administration.\n\nAnother instance is the 2020 presidential election, where Trump's challenges to the election results delayed the transition process. The General Services Administration (GSA) did not formally ascertain Joe Biden as the president-elect until after Trump's efforts to subvert the election results had collapsed, which held up funding and cooperation for the transition.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do U.S. presidential transition teams typically announce key cabinet positions within the first month after the election?\nANSWER: U.S. presidential transition teams do not necessarily announce all key cabinet positions within the first month after the election, although the process of selecting and announcing these positions often begins during this period.\n\n- The transition process involves identifying, recruiting, and guiding candidates through the hiring and confirmation process, which can be lengthy. Security clearances and Senate confirmations are part of this process, and these can take time.\n- While transition teams start working on these appointments immediately after the election, the confirmation process and other logistical steps mean that not all key cabinet positions are typically announced or confirmed within the first month.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, U.S. presidential transition teams do not typically announce all key cabinet positions within the first month after the election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a trend of increasing speed in announcing cabinet nominees in recent U.S. presidential transitions?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear trend of increasing speed in the Senate's confirmation process of cabinet nominees, but there is evidence of presidents announcing their nominations more quickly.\n\n- President Joe Biden announced his Cabinet nominations rapidly, with 12 nominations made by the end of 2020 and all 15 by January 7, 2021, which is quicker than some of his predecessors.\n- However, the Senate's confirmation process has not accelerated correspondingly. In fact, the sources indicate that the confirmation process has been slower in recent transitions, such as Biden's, compared to earlier ones.\n\nTherefore, while presidents may be announcing their nominations more quickly, the overall trend in the speed of the confirmation process itself is not increasing.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (regarding the overall speed of confirmation, but clear that announcements are being made more quickly)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it common for incoming administrations to delay cabinet announcements beyond six weeks after the election?\nANSWER: No, it is not common for incoming administrations to delay cabinet announcements beyond six weeks after the election.\n\nTypically, incoming administrations begin announcing key cabinet positions relatively quickly after the election. For example, President-Elect Donald Trump started assembling his cabinet shortly after his election victory, with a focus on pivotal departments such as State, Defense, and Treasury.\n\nHistorically, presidents have often made significant progress in filling their cabinets within the first few weeks to months following the election. For instance, President George W. Bush had his entire Cabinet confirmed in 12 days, and President Bill Clinton had all but one position filled within 50 days.\n\nWhile there can be variations and delays due to specific circumstances, such as the disputes over election results or other unique events, it is generally expected that cabinet announcements will be made and the confirmation process will be underway well within the first six weeks after the election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it likely that the 2024 election will lead to an extended transition period affecting cabinet announcements?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is unlikely that the 2024 election will lead to an extended transition period affecting cabinet announcements in the same way as in the past. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Presidential Transition Improvement Act of 2022 mandates that the transition process begin five days after the election, even if the winner is still in dispute. This is designed to avoid long delays and ensures that transition support services can start promptly.\n\n- President Joe Biden has already pledged to ensure an orderly transition of power, and he has directed his entire administration to work with Trump's team to facilitate this process.\n\n- The General Services Administration (GSA) is required to provide support services to the President-elect and Vice President-elect as soon as there is a clear determination of the winner, which helps in streamlining the transition process.\n\nTherefore, the measures in place suggest that the transition period should proceed more smoothly and without significant delays.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did President Biden announce more than three cabinet nominees before December 16, 2020?\nANSWER: Yes, President Biden announced more than three cabinet nominees before December 16, 2020.\n\nHere are some of the nominations announced before that date:\n\n- **Secretary of Defense:** Lloyd Austin, announced on December 9, 2020.\n- **Secretary of Agriculture:** Tom Vilsack, announced on December 10, 2020.\n- **Secretary of Housing and Urban Development:** Marcia Fudge, announced on December 10, 2020.\n- **Secretary of Energy:** Jennifer Granholm, announced on December 17, 2020, but before this, there were other announcements:\n  - **Director of National Intelligence:** Avril Haines, announced on November 23, 2020.\n  - **National Security Adviser:** Jack Sullivan, announced on November 23, 2020.\n\nThese announcements indicate that more than three cabinet and key administration nominees were announced before December 16, 2020.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a historical precedent for incoming presidents announcing fewer than four cabinet nominees before December 16?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a historical precedent for incoming presidents announcing fewer than four cabinet nominees before December 16.\n\nFor example, Jimmy Carter, who was not widely acquainted with the typical denizens of a cabinet, announced his first two cabinet choices (Cyrus Vance as Secretary of State and Bert Lance to head the Office of Management and Budget) about five weeks after the election, which would be around mid-November. He did not round out his national security and economic clusters until later, with the full cabinet selections completed by December 23.\n\nSimilarly, other transitions, such as those of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, also did not necessarily have all or even four cabinet nominees announced by December 16. Nixon introduced all 12 departmental secretaries on live TV on December 11, but this was after he had already selected them.\n\nThus, it is clear that there have been instances where incoming presidents had fewer than four cabinet nominees announced by December 16.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have incoming U.S. presidents in recent elections announced more than three federal executive department heads between the election and December 16?\nANSWER: Yes, incoming U.S. presidents in recent elections have announced more than three federal executive department heads between the election and December 16.\n\nFor example, President Joe Biden announced several cabinet members and other key positions in the period following the 2020 presidential election and before December 16, 2020. Some of these announcements include:\n\n- Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack (announced December 10, 2020)\n- Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra (announced December 7, 2020, though the exact date of the announcement might vary slightly, it was within this timeframe)\n- Secretary of Defense (though the specific date for this announcement might be earlier, other announcements like Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo were made on January 7, 2021, but several were made in December)\n- Other positions such as the Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and the U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai were also announced during this period.\n\nThus, it is clear that more than three federal executive department heads were announced within this timeframe.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did President Trump announce more than three cabinet nominees before December 16, 2016?\nANSWER: Yes, President Trump announced more than three cabinet nominees before December 16, 2016.\n\nHere are some of the nominees announced before that date:\n- Jeff Sessions for Attorney General (announced November 18, 2016).\n- Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education (announced November 23, 2016).\n- Wilbur Ross for Secretary of Commerce (announced November 30, 2016).\n- Steven Mnuchin for Secretary of the Treasury (announced November 30, 2016).\n- Tom Price for Secretary of Health & Human Services (announced November 29, 2016).\n- Elaine Chao for Secretary of Transportation (announced November 29, 2016).\n- James Mattis for Secretary of Defense (announced December 1, 2016).\n- John Kelly for Secretary of Homeland Security (announced December 7, 2016).\n- Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State (announced December 13, 2016).\n- Ryan Zinke for Secretary of Interior (announced December 15, 2016).\n- Rick Perry for Secretary of Energy (announced December 14, 2016).\n\nThese announcements were all made before December 16, 2016.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any known factors that could delay cabinet announcements during the 2024 transition period?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several factors that could potentially delay cabinet announcements during the 2024 transition period, based on historical and current contexts:\n\n## Transition Process Delays\n- Delays in the formal ascertainment by the General Services Administration, which triggers the official transition process, can slow down the vetting and announcement of cabinet nominees. This was a factor in the transition for President Biden.\n\n## Senate Confirmation Process\n- The Senate's pace in holding hearings and confirming nominees can be slow. For example, during Biden's transition, only five hearings were held for his nominees before his inauguration, which was fewer than in previous transitions.\n\n## Political and Legislative Factors\n- Ongoing political events, such as impeachment trials or runoff elections that determine Senate control, can divert attention and resources away from the confirmation process. This was the case during Biden's transition.\n\n## Vetting and Controversies\n- The vetting process itself can be time-consuming, especially if nominees face controversies or have complex backgrounds that require thorough review. For instance, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s potential nomination to a health-related role is questionable due to his vaccine skepticism and conspiracy theories, which could complicate his Senate confirmation.\n\n## Campaign and Transition Team Dynamics\n- Changes in transition team leadership or the timing of nominee announcements can also cause delays. Trump's 2016 transition was affected by changes in leadership and late announcements of some nominees.\n\nThese factors highlight potential challenges that could delay the announcement and confirmation of cabinet members during the 2024 transition period.",
    "comment": "**(a)** **Time left until the outcome of the question is known:** 38 days.\n\n**(b)** **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If current trends and historical patterns continue, more than three federal executive department heads will be announced by December 16, 2024. Therefore, the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n**(c)** **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With approximately 9.5 days remaining, there would be less time for announcements. However, given the urgency of establishing a new administration, it's still likely that several key positions would be announced. The probability of only 0-3 announcements would increase slightly but remain low.\n\n**(d)** **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** If there were around 152 days until December 16 (hypothetically extending the deadline), the likelihood of more announcements increases. The probability of only 0-3 announcements would decrease further.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nHistorically, incoming U.S. presidents have announced more than three federal executive department heads between the election and mid-December. Both recent transitionsâ€”the Trump administration in 2016 and the Biden administration in 2020â€”saw numerous cabinet nominations announced well before December 16.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n- **Transition Timelines:** The period between the election and inauguration is critical for setting up the new administration. Announcing cabinet nominees early allows for a smoother transition and signals readiness to govern.\n\n- **Historical Precedent:** President Trump announced at least 11 department heads before December 16, 2016. President Biden announced multiple cabinet positions within the same timeframe in 2020.\n\n- **Political Stability:** As of November 8, 2024, there are no indications of significant delays due to contested election results or other unprecedented events that could hinder the announcement process.\n\n- **Legal Framework:** The Presidential Transition Improvement Act encourages prompt transition activities, reducing the likelihood of extended delays in cabinet announcements.\n\n- **Operational Necessity:** Critical departments like State, Defense, and Treasury often have nominees announced early due to their importance in national security and economic stability.\n\nWhile unforeseen circumstances can always arise, based on historical data and current information, it's unlikely that only 0-3 federal executive department heads will be announced by December 16, 2024.\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
