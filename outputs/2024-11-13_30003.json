    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Alabama have 2.0 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-13\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/alabama) lists greater than or equal to 2.0 million Alabama residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after December 31, 2024. If the number is below 2.0 million, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Drought worsens with little change in the weather pattern expected\n](https://www.wdhn.com/weather/drought-worsens-with-little-change-in-the-weather-pattern-expected/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Alabama having 2.0 million or more residents living in drought conditions by December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Drought Conditions\n- As of the end of October 2024, 36.7% of Alabama residents, which translates to approximately 4.1 million people, are already experiencing drought conditions[2][3].\n- The Southeast, including Alabama, has seen a rapid expansion of dry conditions, with Abnormally Dry (D0) conditions covering 57% of the region, and Moderate to Extreme Drought (D1-D3) conditions affecting specific areas within Alabama and neighboring states[1].\n\n## Recent Trends and Forecasts\n- October 2024 was characterized by a record-setting lack of rainfall in much of the Southeast, including Alabama, which has exacerbated drought conditions. Several locations in Alabama are on track to tie for their driest month on record[1].\n- The forecast for early November indicates limited rainfall, except for northern Alabama and western Tennessee, which may see some relief. However, there is uncertainty for the winter months, with a weak La Niña pattern potentially increasing the odds of below-normal precipitation from December through February[1].\n\n## Impact and Persistence\n- The drought has significant impacts on agriculture, pastures, and water supply, with fire risk increasing and burn bans in place. These conditions suggest that the drought is likely to persist unless there is significant rainfall[1][4].\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The Southeast has experienced alternating periods of wet and dry conditions over the past 7 months, indicating a volatile climate pattern. However, the current dry spell is particularly severe and widespread[1].\n\nGiven these points, it is plausible that a significant portion of Alabama's population could remain in drought conditions by the end of December 2024, especially if the forecasted below-normal precipitation materializes. However, whether exactly 2.0 million or more residents will be affected depends on various factors, including any potential rainfall events and the specific areas most impacted by the drought.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the current data and forecasts suggest a high likelihood of continued drought conditions in Alabama, the exact number of residents affected by December 31, 2024, cannot be definitively determined without further specific rainfall data and updates. Therefore, the answer to whether Alabama will have 2.0 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024, is not immediately clear.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have significant rainfall events occurred in Alabama during November and December 2024 to alleviate drought conditions?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about significant rainfall events in Alabama during November and December 2024 that would alleviate drought conditions.\n\n- The sources discuss weather conditions and drought status up to October 2024 and provide outlooks for the winter period, but they do not provide real-time or future-specific data for November and December 2024[2][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the forecast for December 2024 predict below-normal precipitation in Alabama?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe forecasts for December 2024 in Alabama do not predict below-normal precipitation. Instead, they indicate that precipitation will be above normal. Here are the relevant details:\n\n- According to the source from the Old Farmer's Almanac, December is expected to have precipitation \"1\" above avg. in the north and \"2\" below avg. in the south, but overall, it suggests above-normal precipitation in the north[3].\n- The source from EaseWeather states that significant rainfall exceeding 103.1 mm is expected in Alabama during December, occurring over more than 8 days, which indicates above-normal rainfall[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have climate models predicted continued drought conditions in Alabama through the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no direct prediction from climate models specifically for continued drought conditions in Alabama through the end of 2024. The sources provide information on current drought conditions, historical trends, and long-term climate change impacts, but they do not include specific climate model predictions for the remainder of 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss current drought conditions and their impacts in Alabama[1][2][5].\n- They also mention long-term climate change projections, such as increased severity of droughts and changes in precipitation patterns, but these are general projections for the future and not specific to the end of 2024[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous winter seasons in Alabama failed to alleviate drought conditions?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer to whether previous winter seasons in Alabama have failed to alleviate drought conditions is not definitively clear from the specific context of past winters, but there are some indications and patterns that can be considered:\n\n- The source from the National Weather Service discusses the impact of La Niña on winter precipitation in Alabama. It notes that while strong La Niña events are generally associated with wetter winters, there is significant variability, and not all winters during La Niña events result in above-normal precipitation[3].\n- The drought status update for the Southeast mentions that the expected weak La Niña pattern may increase the odds of below-normal precipitation for December through February across Alabama, which could imply that some winter seasons might not alleviate drought conditions[4].\n\nHowever, these sources do not provide a clear historical record of whether previous winter seasons specifically failed to alleviate drought conditions. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are agricultural impacts from drought in Alabama expected to continue through the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is likely that the agricultural impacts from drought in Alabama will continue through the end of 2024, although there are some indications of potential relief.\n\n- The drought conditions in Alabama have been persistent, with severe and moderate drought affecting a significant portion of the state as of September 2024[2][3].\n- Despite some rainfall from recent hurricanes, the relief has been described as \"too little too late\" for many agricultural needs, and the dry conditions are expected to continue, especially given that October is historically the driest month in Alabama[3].\n- Forecasts suggest near-normal conditions for the next few months, but this does not guarantee an immediate end to the drought impacts, especially since the damage to crops and pastures has already been significant[3].\n\nTherefore, the agricultural impacts from the drought are expected to continue through the end of 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is more than half of Alabama's land area currently classified under drought conditions?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that a significant portion of Alabama is experiencing drought conditions. Here are the relevant details:\n\n- As of early November 2024, \"Moderate Drought (D1) is primarily constrained to Alabama, Tennessee, coastal South Carolina and Virginia, and northeast North Carolina, with some areas of Severe Drought (D2) in Alabama and Tennessee and one spot of Extreme Drought (D3) in Tennessee\"[2].\n- In Alabama, \"eighty-seven percent of the state is either abnormally dry or in moderate drought, according to the most recent release from the U.S. Drought Monitor\"[4].\n\nGiven that 87% of the state is either abnormally dry or in moderate drought, it is clear that more than half of Alabama's land area is currently classified under drought conditions.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are water reservoirs and soil moisture levels in Alabama currently below average heading into December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence suggesting that water levels in some of Alabama's reservoirs are currently lower than usual, but there is no specific information on soil moisture levels or a comprehensive state-wide assessment of water reservoirs heading into December 2024.\n\n- The source from Alabama Power indicates that lake levels across their reservoirs are already lower than usual for this time of year due to recent weather conditions, and they will be lowered further starting October 1[5].\n- However, there is no detailed information on the overall state-wide water reservoir levels or soil moisture levels specifically heading into December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether water reservoirs and soil moisture levels in Alabama are currently below average heading into December 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are drought conditions in Alabama expected to persist or worsen through December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the key points relevant to the question:\n\n- The Southeast, including Alabama, has been experiencing significant drought conditions, with Moderate Drought (D1) and even some areas of Severe Drought (D2) and Extreme Drought (D3) in the region[1].\n- The forecast for the winter months (December through February) suggests that the expected weak La Niña pattern may increase the odds of below-normal precipitation for Alabama, among other states[1][5].\n- The Seasonal Drought Outlook indicates that drought persistence is likely for inland areas of the Southeast, including the Tennessee Valley, which includes parts of Alabama. However, there is some uncertainty due to potential tropical cyclones and other weather patterns[5].\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that drought conditions in Alabama are expected to persist or potentially worsen through December 31, 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Alabama currently experiencing drought conditions affecting 2 million or more residents as of November 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if Alabama is currently experiencing drought conditions affecting 2 million or more residents, we need to consider the extent and impact of the drought.\n\n1. **Extent of Drought**: As of November 5, 2024, approximately 82% of Alabama is under drought conditions, and 16% is abnormally dry. This indicates that nearly the entire state is affected by some level of drought[1][4].\n\n2. **Population Impact**: Alabama's total population is approximately 5.2 million people. Given that nearly the entire state is under some form of drought conditions, it is reasonable to infer that a significant majority of the population is affected. Since 82% of the state is under drought conditions, this would likely impact more than 2 million residents (82% of 5.2 million is about 4.26 million)[1][4].\n\nTherefore, based on the widespread nature of the drought conditions across Alabama, it is clear that more than 2 million residents are affected.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is a La Niña pattern expected to persist through December 2024, leading to reduced precipitation in Alabama?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, here is the analysis:\n\n- A La Niña pattern is expected to emerge in September-November 2024 and persist through January-March 2025, according to NOAA's Climate Prediction Center[2][3][5].\n- The precipitation outlook for the winter of 2024-25 indicates that La Niña is expected to lead to below-average precipitation in the southern tier of the country, including the Southwest, southern Plains, Gulf Coast, and Southeast[2][3][4].\n\nGiven that Alabama is part of the Southeast, the expected La Niña pattern is likely to lead to reduced precipitation in the region, including Alabama, through the winter months, which includes December 2024.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 48 days remain until December 31, 2024.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If current conditions persist, the outcome would be **Yes**; Alabama would have 2.0 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024.\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With roughly 12 days remaining, I would forecast a high probability (around 90%) that the outcome is **Yes**, as significant changes in drought conditions are unlikely in such a short period.\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:** With approximately 192 days remaining, there would be more opportunity for changes in weather patterns, including potential rainfall that could alleviate drought conditions. I would forecast a slightly lower probability (around 75%) that the outcome is **Yes**, due to the increased uncertainty over a longer time frame.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 13, 2024, Alabama is experiencing significant drought conditions. Over 82% of the state is under drought classifications ranging from Moderate Drought (D1) to Extreme Drought (D3), affecting approximately 4.26 million residents—well above the 2.0 million threshold specified in the question.\n\nForecasts indicate that a La Niña pattern is expected to persist through December 2024, which typically leads to below-average precipitation in the Southeast, including Alabama. This weather pattern reduces the likelihood of significant rainfall that could alleviate drought conditions in the coming weeks.\n\nHistorical data shows that drought conditions, once established in late fall, often persist into the winter months due to seasonal weather patterns. Additionally, current soil moisture levels and reservoir statuses suggest that the state is entering the winter period with below-average water availability.\n\nConsidering the time remaining until December 31, 2024, and the climatic outlook, it is highly probable that Alabama will continue to have 2.0 million or more residents living in drought conditions on the resolution date.\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
