    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill WeWork continuously operate through January 1, 2025, without announcing Adam Neumann's return as CEO?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-20\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **No** if before January 1, 2025, Adam Neumann has been announced as the next CEO of WeWork. It also resolves as **No** if the company ceases operations. Otherwise this resolves as **Yes**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nInterim, acting, or temporary CEO does not count.\n\nIf the company has multiple CEOs and this individual is going to be one of them, it will count.\n\nThis question resolves based on announcement; the date of beginning work is irrelevant for purposes of this question. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAdam Neumann co-founded WeWork in 2010 and served as its CEO until 2019. \n\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether WeWork will continuously operate through January 1, 2025, without announcing Adam Neumann's return as CEO, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current State of WeWork\nWeWork has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. and is currently undergoing a restructuring process. The company has nearly $19 billion in debts and $15 billion in assets, and it has a restructuring agreement with creditors representing roughly 92% of its secured notes[1].\n\n## Adam Neumann's Bid\nAdam Neumann has made a bid to buy back WeWork, but this bid has been met with skepticism and has not been accepted as the preferred plan by the creditors. Neumann's bid was reportedly higher than $500 million, but the plan being considered by the creditors is valued at $400 million[2].\n\n## Neumann's Current Involvement\nDespite his efforts to regain control of WeWork, Neumann has not been successful so far. He has since focused on his new venture, Workflow, under his real estate company Flow, which aims to compete with WeWork's model but with a more cautious and disciplined approach[3].\n\n## Leadership and Operations\nThere is no current indication that Adam Neumann will be announced as the CEO of WeWork by January 1, 2025. The company is focused on its restructuring and has not mentioned Neumann's return to the CEO position as part of its plans[1][2].\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\nGiven the history of WeWork's governance issues and financial struggles, the likelihood of significant changes in leadership, especially the return of a former CEO who was ousted due to similar issues, is low unless there are substantial changes in the company's circumstances or creditor agreements.\n\nIn summary, based on the current information:\n- WeWork is undergoing bankruptcy and restructuring.\n- Adam Neumann's bid to buy back WeWork has been rejected in favor of another plan.\n- Neumann is now focused on his new venture, Workflow.\n- There is no indication of Neumann's imminent return as CEO.\n\nTherefore, it is likely that WeWork will continue to operate through January 1, 2025, without announcing Adam Neumann's return as CEO. However, this cannot be definitively confirmed without further developments or official announcements from WeWork.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is WeWork still undergoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy as of November 20, 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nAs of November 20, 2024, WeWork is expected to have exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy. A bankruptcy court judge approved a plan for WeWork to emerge from Chapter 11 in mid-June 2024, after wrapping up administrative matters[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have creditors approved WeWork’s restructuring plan as of the latest update?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of the latest updates, WeWork’s restructuring plan has been approved by the creditors and the court. The plan was approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Sherwood, and all disputes with previously objecting parties, including creditors and landlords, have been resolved[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has WeWork announced its current CEO who is expected to remain in position through January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nWeWork has announced that John Santora, a veteran from Cushman & Wakefield, has been appointed as its new CEO, effective June 12, 2024. There is no indication in the provided sources that he is expected to leave the position before January 1, 2025[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Adam Neumann currently involved in any executive role at WeWork?\nANSWER: NO, Adam Neumann is not currently involved in any executive role at WeWork. He stepped down as CEO in 2019 and, although he remained as non-executive chairman for a time, he has not held an executive position at the company since then[3][4][5]. Additionally, his recent attempts to buy back the company have been unsuccessful[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Adam Neumann currently focusing solely on his new venture, Workflow, without plans to rejoin WeWork?\nANSWER: Yes, Adam Neumann is currently focusing solely on his new venture, Workflow, and does not have plans to rejoin WeWork. After his attempt to buy back WeWork failed, Neumann has shifted his focus to building Workflow under his real estate company, Flow. He has emphasized learning from the past and adopting a more disciplined and cautious approach with his new venture[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any evidence of a successful buyback of WeWork by Adam Neumann?\nANSWER: No, there is no evidence of a successful buyback of WeWork by Adam Neumann. The sources provided discuss his attempts and bids to buy back the company, but they do not indicate that any of these attempts have been successful. Instead, they highlight the skepticism and challenges associated with his bid, including the company's substantial debts and Neumann's past leadership issues[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Adam Neumann publicly stated intentions to return to WeWork’s CEO position by January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Adam Neumann has publicly stated intentions to return to WeWork’s CEO position by January 1, 2025. The sources discuss his attempts to buy back WeWork, his eventual decision to give up on that bid, and his new ventures such as Workflow, but they do not mention any plans for him to return as CEO[1][2][3].\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has WeWork made any official statements regarding changes in its executive leadership since November 2024?\nANSWER: No, the sources provided do not indicate any official statements from WeWork regarding changes in its executive leadership since November 2024. The latest changes mentioned in the sources occurred in June 2024, when David Tolley stepped down and John Santora was appointed as the new CEO[2][5].\n\nHowever, there are mentions of leadership changes in WeWork India in November 2024, but these are specific to WeWork India and not to the global WeWork leadership[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has WeWork secured sufficient funding to continue operations through January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that WeWork has taken significant steps to secure its financial stability, but the sufficiency of the funding through January 1, 2025, is not explicitly confirmed.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- WeWork has emerged from bankruptcy after shedding $4 billion in debt and raising $400 million in additional equity capital. It has also cut future lease obligations, which is expected to bring significant savings[1][3].\n- The company extended its secured credit commitments, which resulted in an extension of $1.75 billion of total liquidity from February 2023 to February 2024[4].\n\nHowever, the sources do not provide specific details about the company's financial situation or funding beyond February 2024. Therefore, it is unclear whether the current funding arrangements are sufficient to continue operations through January 1, 2025.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has WeWork reported any significant operational disruptions since beginning the restructuring process?\nANSWER: Yes, WeWork has reported significant operational disruptions since beginning the restructuring process.\n\n- The company has delayed filing its annual financial report due to the ongoing search for a new independent registered public accounting firm after Ernst & Young’s resignation[1].\n- WeWork has renegotiated and either assumed or rejected numerous leases as part of its bankruptcy proceedings, with over 90 leases rejected out of nearly 300 U.S. and Canada locations. This has resulted in the closure of several locations, including one in Chicago's Fulton Market[1][4].\n- The company has reported significant financial losses, such as a $153.7 million loss in January, and is dealing with substantial debt exceeding $4 billion[1][3].\n- There have been legal disputes with landlords and ongoing challenges in renegotiating leases, which have complicated the restructuring process[3].\n\nThese developments indicate substantial operational disruptions as WeWork navigates its Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 1 month and 12 days (from November 20, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions persist without any new developments, WeWork is expected to continue operating through January 1, 2025, with John Santora serving as CEO. There would be no announcement of Adam Neumann's return as CEO.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith roughly one-third of the current timeframe remaining (around 3 weeks), the window for significant changes decreases. The likelihood of Adam Neumann being announced as CEO within this shortened period remains minimal, maintaining a high probability that WeWork continues operations without his return.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nExtending the timeframe to approximately 4.5 months could introduce more opportunities for unexpected developments, such as strategic shifts or new negotiations. However, given the current trajectory of WeWork's restructuring and Adam Neumann's focus on his new venture, the probability of his return as CEO would still likely remain low, though slightly increased compared to the current period.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAs of November 20, 2024, WeWork has successfully exited Chapter 11 bankruptcy and has a new CEO, John Santora, in place until at least January 1, 2025. Adam Neumann's attempts to buy back the company have been unsuccessful, and he is currently dedicated to his new venture, Workflow. There is no public indication or strategic reason to believe that Adam Neumann will be announced as the CEO of WeWork in the short timeframe remaining. Additionally, the company's focus on restructuring and stabilizing its operations diminishes the likelihood of leadership changes at this stage.\n\nConsidering the short time remaining until the resolution date and the current stability in leadership and operations, the probability that WeWork will continuously operate through January 1, 2025, without announcing Adam Neumann's return as CEO is very high.\n\n**Probability: 95%**",
