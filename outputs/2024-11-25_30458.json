    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Florida Governor Ron Desantis refrain from naming the replacement for Marco Rubio's Senate seat before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before January 1, 2025, Ron DeSantis has not named the successor to Marco Rubio's US Senate seat. If he has named Rubio's successor before then, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[DeSantis aims to appoint Marco Rubioâ€™s Senate replacement by early January](https://apnews.com/article/us-senate-florida-rubio-desantis-trump-appointment-49e3d490a298b64470c69d1892efc1b8)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the available information, it is highly likely that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will refrain from naming the replacement for Marco Rubio's Senate seat before January 1, 2025.\n\n- Governor DeSantis has announced that Floridians will likely know who their next U.S. senator will be by the beginning of January, indicating that the decision will be made in early January[1][3].\n- DeSantis is currently in the process of gathering names, conducting preliminary vetting, and plans to do more extensive vetting and candidate interviews in the coming weeks, which suggests that the final decision will not be made until early January[1][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Governor DeSantis will refrain from naming the replacement before January 1, 2025, is likely \"yes.\"\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any significant political pressure for Governor DeSantis to announce the Senate replacement before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: There is no specific mention in the provided sources of significant political pressure for Governor DeSantis to announce the Senate replacement before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss various candidates and the process of selection, but they do not specify a deadline or pressure to make the announcement before the start of 2025.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Governor DeSantis currently gathering and vetting potential candidates for Marco Rubio's Senate seat?\nANSWER: YES\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis has stated that he has started gathering and vetting potential candidates to replace Marco Rubio's Senate seat. He mentioned that he has already received strong interest from several possible candidates and plans to conduct more extensive vetting and candidate interviews over the next few weeks[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Governor DeSantis publicly committed to announcing the Senate replacement by early January 2025?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nGovernor DeSantis has publicly committed to announcing the Senate replacement by the beginning of January 2025, but the specific wording of the commitment is for early January, not early January 2025. The sources indicate that the selection is likely to be made by the beginning of January, which refers to January 2025, but the commitment is for the start of the month, not specifically the year 2025[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any potential candidates for the Senate seat indicated they are not ready to be announced before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any potential candidates for the Senate seat indicating they are not ready to be announced before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss the outcomes of the 2024 Senate elections, the current and future composition of the Senate, and some candidate statements, but they do not address the specific timing of candidate announcements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Governor DeSantis made any public statements indicating that the decision on the Senate replacement will not be made before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nGovernor DeSantis has made public statements indicating that the decision on the Senate replacement for Marco Rubio will likely be made by the beginning of January 2025. In his statements, he mentioned that more extensive vetting and candidate interviews will be conducted over the coming weeks, with a selection likely made by the beginning of January[2][3][5]. This implies that the decision will not be made before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Governor DeSantis indicated that upcoming political events will influence the timing of the Senate replacement announcement?\nANSWER: No, Governor DeSantis has not indicated that upcoming political events will influence the timing of the Senate replacement announcement. The sources state that DeSantis plans to make the selection by the beginning of January, based on the vetting process and the expected resignation of Senator Marco Rubio to assume his new role as Secretary of State on January 20th, but they do not mention any specific upcoming political events affecting this timeline[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the vetting process for the Senate replacement expected to continue through December 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe vetting process for the Senate replacement for Marco Rubio is expected to continue through December 2024. Governor Ron DeSantis has stated that he will conduct \"preliminary vetting\" and then more \"extensive vetting and candidate interviews\" over the next few weeks, with the selection likely made by the beginning of January[2][3][5]. This indicates that the vetting process will extend into December.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any procedural requirements that would prevent Governor DeSantis from naming the Senate replacement before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: In Florida, the procedural requirements for filling a U.S. Senate vacancy are clear. Unlike some states that require special elections to fill Senate vacancies, Florida is one of the 45 states that authorize their governors to appoint a temporary replacement.\n\nThere are no procedural requirements in Florida law that would prevent Governor DeSantis from naming a Senate replacement before January 1, 2025. Florida law allows the governor to make temporary appointments until a special election can be held, and there is no specific timeline or restriction that would prevent an appointment before January 1, 2025[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Governor DeSantis previously delayed appointments of similar positions until closer to a deadline?\nANSWER: Yes, Governor DeSantis has previously delayed appointments of similar positions until closer to a deadline or beyond the expected timeframe.\n\nFor example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, DeSantis delayed filling state Supreme Court vacancies that had been open since the end of 2019. He blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for the delay, stating that the state of emergency and his inability to dedicate time to reviewing the candidates' opinions and writings contributed to the postponement[1].\n\nAdditionally, in August 2020, DeSantis was slow to make executive appointments to regional water boards, prompting an environmental group to warn that the boards would soon be unable to field a quorum if appointments were not made. DeSantis eventually made these appointments later that fall[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any legal deadlines in Florida that require the Senate replacement to be named by a specific date?\nANSWER: In Florida, the process for filling a Senate vacancy does not involve the governor directly, as Florida is one of the states that requires Senate vacancies to be filled only by special elections. Here are the relevant details:\n\n- If a vacancy occurs, the governor is required to order a special election. However, there is no specific deadline for the governor to name a replacement, because the replacement is to be elected through a special election[1].\n\n- The special election process has timelines, but these are related to the scheduling of the election rather than the naming of an interim replacement. For example, if the vacancy occurs more than 60 days before a general election, the governor must order a special election to be held on the first Tuesday after the lapse of 60 days from the day the vacancy is known to the governor[1].\n\nTherefore, there are no legal deadlines in Florida that require the Senate replacement to be named by a specific date, as the replacement is determined through an election process rather than an appointment. The focus is on the timing of the special election rather than the naming of an interim appointee.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (in the context of naming a replacement by a specific date, as the process involves elections rather than appointments)",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 37 days (from November 25, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changes:** Yes, Governor DeSantis will refrain from naming the replacement before January 1, 2025.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 9 days):** Probability decreases slightly due to the reduced time for any unexpected changes or pressures, but remains high. **Probability: 85%**\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left (approximately 148 days):** With more time, there's increased potential for political shifts, public pressure, or strategic decisions that could influence the timing of the announcement. This introduces more uncertainty. **Probability: 75%**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis has publicly indicated that the selection of Marco Rubio's Senate replacement is expected to occur in early January 2025. As of November 25, 2024, there are 37 days remaining until the January 1, 2025, cutoff. The ongoing vetting process, absence of significant political pressure to announce earlier, and DeSantis's historical tendencies to delay appointments suggest a high likelihood that he will adhere to the planned timeline.\n\nHowever, considering potential unforeseen political dynamics or strategic considerations, there remains some uncertainty. The subquestions indicate that while DeSantis is actively vetting candidates and hasn't faced immediate pressures to expedite the process, the situation isn't entirely without variables.\n\nAdjusting the timeframe illustrates how the probability shifts with increased or decreased time left. With only 9 days remaining, the window for change is narrower, slightly increasing confidence in the \"Yes\" outcome. Conversely, with 148 days, the extended period allows for more potential influences that could sway the decision.\n\nTaking all factors into account, the probability that Governor DeSantis will refrain from naming the replacement before January 1, 2025, is high.\n\n**Probability: 80%**",
