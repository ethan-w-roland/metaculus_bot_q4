    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS exceed 2.6M for October 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which can be access through [this link](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view), shows greater than 2,600,000 background check initiated in October 2024. If the number is less than or equal to 2,600,000, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNumbers are expected to be reported in the month subsequent, so for example October numbers are expected to be reported in November. In case of reporting delays, resolution will wait, until the question will be annulled in early January 2025 if there are no numbers reported by then for the time in question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn the long term (since the turn of the 21st Century), firearms sales in the US have risen, surging in 2020, with numbers trending downward since. Starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers have again begun trending upward.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) will exceed 2.6 million for October 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Trends\n- The number of NICS background checks has been consistently high, with over a million checks per month for more than four years.\n- However, recent data shows a decline in background checks. For example, April 2024 saw a 14.4% decrease in unadjusted FBI NICS figures compared to April 2023.\n\n## Seasonal Variations\n- Background checks typically rise during the final months of the year due to hunting seasons and holiday sales. This trend is observed annually, with November and December often seeing higher numbers.\n\n## Recent Data\n- The April 2024 NICS figures were significantly lower than the previous year, which might indicate a broader trend of decreasing background checks. However, this does not necessarily predict the behavior for October specifically.\n\n## Monthly Averages\n- While the monthly average has been over a million, the specific figure for October can vary. There is no recent data provided for October specifically, so it's difficult to predict with certainty.\n\n## Base Rates\n- Historically, October has not been one of the peak months for background checks, which are more commonly seen in November and December. However, it still maintains a significant number of checks.\n\nGiven these points, while it is possible for the number of background checks to exceed 2.6 million in October, the recent decline in background checks and the lack of specific data for October make it uncertain. Therefore, the answer cannot be clearly determined as yes or no based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the FBI NICS report more than 2.6 million background checks in October 2023?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources provided do not indicate that the FBI NICS reported more than 2.6 million background checks in October 2023. According to the information from the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), the unadjusted FBI NICS figure for October 2023 was 2,194,313, which is less than 2.6 million.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an upcoming election or political event in 2024 that could be impacting firearm sales?\nANSWER: YES, there is an upcoming election in 2024 that could potentially impact firearm sales, although the current data suggests it is not having the typical effect seen in previous election years.\n\n- The 2024 presidential election is the significant political event in question, but unlike past election years, it has not yet triggered a notable increase in gun sales. This is attributed to several factors, including less anxiety about stricter gun regulations and the current political dynamics, such as Kamala Harris's moderated approach to gun control and the unlikely advancement of significant gun control measures in Congress.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have economic factors in 2024 contributed to an increase in firearm purchases?\nANSWER: The impact of economic factors on firearm purchases in 2024 is complex and multifaceted.\n\n- While economic uncertainties and instability are mentioned as factors that could influence firearm purchases, they do not necessarily lead to an increase. For instance, economic uncertainty, inflation, and personal income changes are noted to be factors causing consumers to purchase less ammunition and, by extension, potentially fewer firearms.\n- However, other economic and social factors, such as fears of gun legislation, personal safety concerns, and domestic politics, continue to drive some consumers to purchase firearms. For example, the anticipation of stricter gun control laws and ongoing concerns about personal safety and security are still motivating factors for some buyers.\n\nGiven these mixed influences, it is unclear whether economic factors alone have contributed to an overall increase in firearm purchases in 2024. Some factors suggest a decrease or stabilization in sales, while others indicate continued demand driven by specific concerns.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are firearm retailers reporting higher-than-usual sales leading up to October 2024?\nANSWER: No, firearm retailers are not reporting higher-than-usual sales leading up to October 2024. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- Firearm sales in the first quarter of 2024 were down 8.79% compared to 2023 and down 16.16% from the three-year average.\n- NICS checks, which are indicative of firearm sales, were down 4% in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023, and down 7.4% in March compared to the same month last year.\n- Overall sales trends for 2024 are showing declines, with projections indicating a down 10% to 15% overall in firearm sales for the year.\n- Despite some localized increases or temporary spikes, the general trend is one of declining sales and increased inventories, which is not indicative of higher-than-usual sales leading up to October 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there reports of supply shortages or increased demand for firearms in October 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are reports of supply shortages and related issues in the context of firearms and ammunition in October 2024.\n\n- A gunpowder shortage is anticipated due to increased military demands, particularly driven by conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, which are affecting the global supply of nitrocellulose, a key component in gunpowder production.\n- There are expectations of price increases and shortages of ammunition at retail levels in the coming months, partly due to the upcoming presidential election and ongoing global tensions.\n- Although ammunition inventory was up 6% through October 2023, there was a decline in October, and year-to-date sales fell nearly 9%. Consumers still report concerns about the availability of ammunition, with 50% stating their personal ammunition inventory was below their preferred level in Q3 2023.\n\nThese reports indicate ongoing issues with supply and demand in the firearms and ammunition market as of October 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been an increasing trend in monthly background checks from July to September 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the data provided from the sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- In July 2024, the NSSF-adjusted NICS figure marked the first year-over-year monthly increase since December 2023, with a 4.0 percent increase.\n- In August 2024, the NSSF-adjusted NICS figure increased by 8.3 percent year-over-year, which is a sequential increase from the July figure.\n- In September 2024, the NSSF-adjusted NICS figure increased by 1.3 percent year-over-year, which is a sequential deceleration compared to the increases in August and July.\n\nWhile there was an increase in the number of background checks from July to August, the increase from August to September was less significant, indicating a deceleration in the growth rate.\n\nTherefore, the trend from July to September 2024 shows an initial increase followed by a deceleration, rather than a consistent increase.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as the trend is not consistently increasing)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major firearm manufacturers reported increased sales or production in recent months?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the answer to whether major firearm manufacturers have reported increased sales or production in recent months is generally negative or mixed.\n\n1. **Sales Trends**: The data indicates that firearm sales have been declining or stabilizing rather than increasing. For example, in 2024, handgun sales are down 15% to 20% compared to previous years, and overall firearm sales are not showing a significant increase.\n\n2. **Inventory and Production**: There is a mention of increased inventories and a need for manufacturers to reduce output due to stagnant sales. This suggests that production is not increasing but rather adjusting to lower demand.\n\n3. **Regional and Quarterly Data**: While there are some regional variations and a slight increase in certain types of firearms like rifles, the overall trend does not indicate a broad increase in sales or production. For instance, rifle shipments showed a slowing growth, and handgun shipments were down in some regions.\n\nTherefore, the evidence does not support a general increase in sales or production for major firearm manufacturers in recent months.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the number of background checks reported by the FBI NICS in September 2024 exceeded 2.6 million?\nANSWER: To determine if the number of background checks reported by the FBI NICS in September 2024 exceeded 2.6 million, we need to look at the specific data for September 2024.\n\nFrom the source provided by the FBI's NICS firearm background checks statistics, the September 2024 data is as follows:\n\n- The PDF document from the FBI does not provide the exact figure for September 2024 in the snippet, but other sources can help fill in this gap.\n\nThe article from the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) does not provide the exact September 2024 figure, but it discusses trends and other months.\n\nHowever, the article from the American Rifleman mentions that September 2024 marked the 62nd month in a row of more than 1 million firearm purchases, but it does not specify the exact number for September 2024.\n\nSince none of the provided sources explicitly state the number of background checks for September 2024, we cannot definitively say whether it exceeded 2.6 million.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant events in September or October 2024 that could influence an increase in firearm purchases?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several significant events in September 2024 that could potentially influence an increase in firearm purchases:\n\n## Armed Conflicts and Protests\n- The ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the subsequent protests in Israel and the United States could create a climate of insecurity, potentially leading to increased interest in firearm purchases.\n\n## Mass Shootings\n- A mass school shooting at Apalachee High School in September 2024, which resulted in four deaths and nine injuries, could lead to increased concerns about safety and security, potentially driving up firearm sales.\n\n## Civil Unrest\n- Protests and civil unrest, such as the large-scale protests in Israel following the recovery of hostages' bodies and the calls for the Prime Minister's resignation, could contribute to a sense of instability and fear, which might encourage people to purchase firearms.\n\n## International Tensions\n- The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and the associated military actions, including drone attacks and missile shipments, could heighten global tensions and contribute to a general sense of insecurity that might influence firearm purchases.\n\nThese events, particularly those involving violence, conflict, and civil unrest, can create an environment where people might feel the need to acquire firearms for personal protection. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any October in previous years seen over 2.6 million background checks reported by the FBI NICS?\nANSWER: To determine if any October in previous years has seen over 2.6 million background checks reported by the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), we need to examine the historical data provided by the FBI.\n\nThe FBI's NICS data, as presented in the sources, breaks down the background checks by month and year. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The monthly breakdowns for each year are provided, but the specific monthly totals for October are not explicitly highlighted in the sources provided.\n- However, the sources do indicate that the highest monthly totals for background checks have occurred during periods of high demand, such as in 2020, particularly in March of that year when 2.3 million background checks were completed.\n\nTo find the specific October data, one would need to look at the detailed monthly breakdowns for each year. Since the sources provided do not explicitly list the October totals, we cannot directly confirm from the given information whether any October has exceeded 2.6 million background checks.\n\nTherefore, based on the information available, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of November 5, 2024, the FBI NICS data for October 2024 is expected to be released within this month or early next month. Therefore, the time left until the outcome is known is approximately **1 month**.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends continue without significant changes, the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated in October 2024 is likely to be similar to recent years' figures. Historically, October has not exceeded 2.6 million background checks except during exceptional circumstances. Therefore, the outcome would likely be **No**, with the number not surpassing 2.6 million.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only a quarter of the time left (about one week), and assuming no major events have occurred to significantly influence firearm purchases, the forecast would remain unchanged. The probability of exceeding 2.6 million background checks would be **low**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there was four times the time left (about four months), there would be more uncertainty due to potential events that could impact firearm sales (elections, legislation, societal events). However, barring unforeseen circumstances, the long-term trends suggest that the likelihood of exceeding 2.6 million checks remains **moderate to low**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Data:** Up to my last update in October 2023, the number of background checks in October typically ranged around 2.2 to 2.6 million. The exceptional year was 2020, with over 3 million checks in several months due to the pandemic, civil unrest, and the election.\n\n- **Recent Trends:** After the 2020 surge, firearm sales and background checks have generally trended downward or stabilized. There have been slight increases in certain months, but not enough to surpass previous peaks.\n\n- **Seasonal Variations:** October usually sees an uptick in background checks due to hunting season and the approaching holidays, but not typically enough to exceed 2.6 million unless influenced by extraordinary events.\n\n- **Potential Influences:**\n  - **Political Climate:** Presidential election years can influence firearm sales due to fears of potential regulation. However, as of my last update, the 2024 political climate does not show signs of causing a significant surge.\n  - **Economic Factors:** Economic instability can either increase or decrease firearm purchases. Current economic indicators suggest a mixed impact.\n  - **Social Events:** Significant events (e.g., civil unrest, mass shootings) can drive spikes in firearm sales. Without knowledge of such events occurring in late 2024, this factor is uncertain.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Based on historical patterns and known factors up to October 2023, the likelihood of October 2024 exceeding 2.6 million background checks is modest. While not impossible, it would require significant influencing factors not evident from current trends.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
