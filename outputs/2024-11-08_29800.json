    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of active US oil drilling rigs be greater than or equal to 585 and less than or equal to 590 on November 29, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-08\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of active oil drilling rigs is greater than or equal to 585 and less than or equal to 590 on November 29, 2024, according to the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count, which can be accessed at [this](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_rotary_rigs) Ycharts link.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe link will be accessed by Metaculus Admins on or around November 29, 2024. In case of its inaccessibility, the secondary resolution source will be from Baker Hughes itself at [this link](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count). If both resolution links remain inaccessible by the end of the tournament, the question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBaker Hughes [issues](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/) US oil rig counts every Friday, and issued oil rig counts to the petroleum industry since 1944.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the number of active US oil drilling rigs being within the range of 585 to 590 on November 29, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Rig Count\nAs of the week ending November 1, 2024, the total US rig count is 585, with 479 of those being oil rigs.\n\n## Historical Trends\n- The US rig count has been relatively stable over the past few weeks, with minor fluctuations. For example, the total rig count has been at 585 for the weeks ending October 25 and November 1, 2024.\n- The oil rig count specifically has also shown stability, with a current count of 479, down slightly from the previous week.\n\n## Regional Breakdown\n- The major shale plays, such as the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, and others, have shown minimal changes in rig counts over the recent months. For instance, the Permian Basin rig count is at 304 rigs, which is down by just a few rigs from the previous month.\n\n## Year-over-Year Comparison\n- The total US rig count is down by 6.4% from the same period last year, indicating a general trend of stability but with a slight decline.\n\n## Predictive Factors\n- Oil prices, which are a significant factor influencing rig counts, have been volatile but generally stable in the recent period. As of October 25, 2024, oil prices were at $71.78, which is not drastically different from previous months.\n- Technological improvements and economic conditions also play a role, but there are no immediate indicators suggesting a significant increase or decrease in the near term.\n\nGiven these points, while it is impossible to predict the exact number of rigs with certainty, here are some insights for the superforecaster:\n\n- **Base Rate**: The current stability in rig counts suggests that large changes are less likely.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The question pertains to a specific date (November 29, 2024), which is about four weeks from the current data. Historical data shows that changes over such a short period are typically minor.\n- **Current State**: The rig count has been stable, and there are no immediate indicators of significant changes in oil prices or other factors that would drastically alter the rig count.\n- **Reference Classes**: Historical data indicates that the rig count can fluctuate but tends to remain within a narrow range over short periods.\n\nBased on this information, it seems plausible that the number of active US oil drilling rigs could remain within the specified range, but it is not possible to definitively answer the question as yes or no without future data. The stability in recent weeks and the lack of significant indicators for change suggest a higher likelihood of the rig count staying within this range, but uncertainties such as changes in oil prices or unexpected economic shifts could still influence the outcome.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average US active oil drilling rig count currently between 585 and 590?\nANSWER: NO;\n\nThe current US active oil drilling rig count is 479, which is significantly lower than the range of 585 to 590. This count includes only oil rigs and does not include gas or miscellaneous rigs.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US active oil drilling rig count shown an increasing trend over the past three months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the US active oil drilling rig count has not shown an increasing trend over the past three months.\n\n- As of November 1, 2024, the oil rig count was 479, which is down from 488 one month ago and 504 one year ago.\n- The rig count has been relatively stable or slightly decreasing over the recent months. For example, the oil rig count fell by one week over week to 479 as of November 1, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the trend over the past three months is not increasing.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major US oil companies announced plans to increase drilling activities in the near future?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear announcement from major US oil companies regarding plans to increase drilling activities in the near future.\n\n- The sources discuss current trends and forecasts in oil and gas production, such as the increase in productivity and efficiency despite a decrease in the number of active rigs.\n- They also mention regional variations in rig counts and some increases in specific areas, but these do not constitute a broad announcement from major US oil companies to increase drilling activities.\n- There is discussion on the potential impact of policy changes and market dynamics, but no explicit statement from major companies about their plans to increase drilling.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current oil prices higher than they were six months ago?\nANSWER: To determine if current oil prices are higher than they were six months ago, we need to compare the current prices with those from six months prior.\n\nAs of the current date (November 8, 2024):\n- Brent crude oil prices are around $75.59 per barrel.\n\nSix months ago, in May 2024:\n- Brent crude oil prices had fallen to $76 per barrel following an OPEC+ meeting, but later bounced back to average $82 per barrel in June.\n\nGiven this information:\n- The current Brent crude oil price of $75.59 is lower than the average price of $82 per barrel in June, which was six months ago.\n\nTherefore, the current oil prices are not higher than they were six months ago.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a significant increase in global oil demand that could lead to more US oil drilling?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication of a significant increase in global oil demand that would lead to more US oil drilling in the near future.\n\n- Global oil demand growth is expected to slow down. The IEA reports that demand growth will be much lower than in previous years, with demand expected to peak by 2030 and then decline.\n- The World Bank notes that global oil demand is projected to grow by about 1 million barrels per day in 2025, which is a marked slowdown from the 2 million barrels per day increase seen in 2023.\n- Goldman Sachs also predicts that while oil demand will continue to grow until around 2034, it will do so at a slower rate, and eventually peak and then decline.\n\nGiven these forecasts, there is no strong evidence to suggest a significant increase in global oil demand that would necessitate a substantial increase in US oil drilling. Instead, the outlook suggests a surplus in oil supply and a slowing demand growth.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OPEC recently reduced oil production quotas, potentially affecting US oil drilling activity?\nANSWER: OPEC+ has indeed implemented and extended various production cuts that could impact oil production levels and, by extension, influence global oil markets, including those in the US.\n\n- OPEC+ has extended a 3.6 million barrels per day production cut until the end of 2025, and an additional 2.2 million barrels per day of voluntary cuts by eight member countries until the end of the third quarter of 2024.\n- Despite these cuts, some countries like Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Russia have been producing above their quotas, but the overall policy aims to maintain or reduce production levels to support market stability.\n\nThese measures to reduce or maintain lower production levels could potentially affect global oil supply and demand dynamics, which in turn might influence US oil drilling activity. However, the direct impact on US oil drilling would depend on various factors including market conditions, demand, and the response of US oil producers.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are recent industry forecasts predicting an increase in US oil drilling activity in the upcoming months?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the forecasts for US oil drilling activity in the upcoming months are mixed and do not strongly indicate a significant increase.\n\n- The rig count has been relatively stable but at lower levels, with some fluctuations. For example, the rig count has stayed in the 630s for nearly four months, and there was a slight decrease in the third quarter of 2024.\n- Forecasts suggest that onshore drilling activity is expected to stay flat or see only marginal increases in 2024. For instance, the number of wells drilled in the Lower 48 is expected to be around 18,000 in 2024, which is only a slight increase from 2023.\n- While there are some positive indicators, such as increased efficiency and the completion of drilled and uncompleted wells (DUCs), these factors do not necessarily translate to an immediate increase in drilling activity. Instead, they help explain why oil production has remained strong despite lower rig activity.\n- There is an expectation that new gas pipeline projects coming online in the latter part of 2024 and into 2025 might eventually lead to increased drilling activity, but this impact is not anticipated to be significant until after 2024.\n\nTherefore, the overall consensus from these sources does not predict a substantial increase in US oil drilling activity in the upcoming months.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent technological advancements that make oil drilling more efficient in the US?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nRecent technological advancements have significantly enhanced the efficiency of oil drilling in the US. Here are some key innovations:\n\n- **Horizontal Drilling and Extended Reach Drilling**: These techniques allow for the extraction of oil and gas from a single wellbore over long distances, maximizing resource recovery and reducing the environmental impact.\n\n- **Seismic Imaging**: This technology improves the accuracy of locating oil and gas deposits, reducing the risk of drilling dry wells and optimizing drilling operations.\n\n- **Big Data and Real-Time Analytics**: The use of big data and real-time analytics helps in predictive maintenance, optimizing drilling parameters, and identifying potential new reserves, all of which contribute to increased efficiency and reduced costs.\n\n- **Robotics and Automation**: Automated drilling systems, remote-operated vehicles (ROVs), and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) enhance safety, reduce labor costs, and improve the precision and efficiency of drilling operations.\n\n- **Advanced Drilling Technologies**: Innovations such as dynamic positioning systems, advanced blowout preventers, and autonomous drilling rigs have increased operational efficiency and safety in deepwater drilling.\n\n- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)**: AI and ML are used for predictive maintenance, real-time optimization of drilling parameters, and reservoir characterization, further enhancing efficiency and safety.\n\nThese advancements have played a crucial role in the Shale Revolution in the US, enabling significant growth in oil and gas production.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming economic indicators suggesting a boost in the US energy sector before November 29, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several indicators that suggest positive trends or stability in the US energy sector, although they may not necessarily indicate a direct 'boost' before November 29, 2024:\n\n## Electricity Generation\n- The hot summer temperatures have increased U.S. electricity demand, leading to a forecasted 3% increase in residential electricity sales in 2024. This increase is partly driven by solar power and natural gas, indicating continued activity in the electricity generation sector.\n\n## Biofuels\n- Biomass-based diesel products are making up an increasing share of the total distillate fuel oil consumed in the U.S., with biofuels expected to account for 9% of total distillate fuel oil consumption in 2024, up from 8% last year.\n\n## Natural Gas Prices\n- While natural gas prices are forecasted to remain relatively flat during the shoulder season (September and October), they are expected to rise in 2025. However, this does not indicate a boost before November 29, 2024, but rather stability in the short term.\n\n## Crude Oil Prices\n- Despite some fluctuations, crude oil prices are expected to average $82 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to ongoing withdrawals from global oil inventories and OPEC+ production cuts. This stability in oil prices could support the energy sector.\n\nGiven these points, while there are positive and stable trends in various segments of the energy sector, there is no clear indication of a specific 'boost' before November 29, 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been significant changes in US oil production policies or regulations in the past year that could impact drilling activities?\nANSWER: There have been some notable developments and continuations of existing policies that could impact US oil production activities, although they may not all be characterized as significant changes in the past year.\n\n1. **Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)**: While passed in August 2022, the IRA's provisions continue to influence current policies. It includes a requirement for the government to offer specified acreage of federal onshore and offshore holdings for oil and gas leasing, which was a controversial compromise to allow for the passage of the bill. This provision is relevant as it affects drilling activities on federal lands.\n\n2. **Approval of the Willow Project**: In March 2023, the Biden administration approved a slimmed-down version of the Willow project, an oil production project on Alaska’s North Slope. This approval, while not a new regulation, is a significant decision that impacts drilling activities in the region.\n\n3. **Environmental and Regulatory Considerations**: There is ongoing emphasis on environmental regulations and sustainability goals. Policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions, such as stringent fuel economy standards and regulations on domestic oil production, continue to shape the oil industry. However, these are not new developments but rather ongoing efforts to balance production with sustainability.\n\n4. **Market and Economic Factors**: Changes in oil prices and market dynamics, as forecasted by the EIA, influence drilling activities. For example, lower crude oil price forecasts have led to reduced production forecasts in some regions. However, these are more market-driven than regulatory changes.\n\nIn summary, while there have been significant decisions and ongoing regulatory efforts, the most recent year has seen more of a continuation and implementation of existing policies rather than major new changes in regulations specifically targeting drilling activities. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**, as the question seeks significant new changes in the past year, and the sources primarily highlight ongoing policies and market-driven adjustments.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of today, November 8, 2024, there are **21 days** remaining until November 29, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed from the current figures, the outcome would be **No**. The current number of active US oil drilling rigs is **479**, which is significantly below the target range of **585 to 590**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about **5 days** left until November 29, 2024, the probability of the rig count reaching the target range would be even lower, approaching zero, due to the insufficient time for such a substantial increase.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **84 days** (about three months) left until November 29, 2024, the probability would be slightly higher. However, given the current trends and lack of significant indicators for a substantial increase in rig counts, it would still remain low.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Rig Count:** The latest data shows that the active US oil drilling rig count is **479**, well below the target range of **585 to 590**.\n\n- **Historical Trends:** There has been a **slight decline** or stability in rig counts over recent months. For instance, the rig count decreased from **488** a month ago to **479** currently.\n\n- **Time Frame:** With only **three weeks** remaining until November 29, 2024, it is highly unlikely that the rig count will increase by over **100 rigs** to reach the minimum of **585**. Such a significant jump in a short period is unprecedented without a major market catalyst.\n\n- **Market Factors:**\n  - **Oil Prices:** Current oil prices are **not higher** than they were six months ago, reducing the incentive for drilling companies to significantly ramp up operations.\n  - **Global Demand:** There is **no significant increase** in global oil demand forecasted that could drive a surge in US drilling activities within the next few weeks.\n  - **OPEC+ Production Cuts:** While OPEC+ has extended production cuts, this has not translated into increased US drilling activity, as evidenced by recent trends.\n\n- **Industry Forecasts:** Recent industry analyses predict that US oil drilling activity will remain **flat or see only marginal increases** in the near term. There are **no indications** of major US oil companies planning significant increases in drilling before November 29, 2024.\n\n- **Technological Advancements:** Although there have been advancements making drilling more efficient, these improvements largely allow for **maintaining or modestly increasing production** without a corresponding large increase in rig counts.\n\n- **Policy and Regulations:** There have been **no significant changes** in US oil production policies in the past year that would prompt a rapid increase in drilling activities within the next 21 days.\n\n**Probability: 1%**",
