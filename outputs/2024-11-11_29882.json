    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill a mouse be confirmed to have lived for 2,500 days before January 1, 2025?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-11\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question shall resolve positively if by January 1, 2025, credible media reports state that an individual [laboratory mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_mouse) of species *Mus musculus* has lived for at least 2,500 days.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe longest lived laboratory mouse ever was a growth hormone receptor knockout mouse which lived to approximately 1,800 days old in the lab of Andrzej Bartke at Southern Illinois University. The maximum for normal B6 mice under ideal conditions is 1200 days. \n\nIn order for a mouse to live for 2,500 days, it is highly likely that a major breakthrough in rejuvenation of mammalian organisms will have to be achieved, and so this achievement would likely have significant implications for humanity.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of a mouse being confirmed to have lived for 2,500 days before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Life Expectancy of Mice\n- The average lifespan of a mouse, particularly the C57BL/6J strain commonly used in research, is approximately 24-30 months (around 720-900 days)[5].\n- Mice over 24 months of age are considered \"very old,\" and their survivorship drops off markedly[5].\n\n## Current Research and Breakthroughs\n- Recent studies have shown that mice treated with a specific antibody (X203) to block interleukin 11 can live up to 25% longer than their peers, which would extend their lifespan but still not approach 2,500 days[1].\n- This extension, while significant, translates to an additional 6-7.5 months at most, based on the average lifespan, which is far short of the 2,500-day mark.\n\n## Historical Context and Feasibility\n- Achieving a lifespan of 2,500 days (approximately 6.85 years) in mice would require a major breakthrough in rejuvenation or anti-aging therapies that significantly exceed current scientific capabilities[4].\n\nGiven these points, it is highly unlikely that a mouse will be confirmed to have lived for 2,500 days before January 1, 2025, as this would far surpass the known maximum lifespan of mice and the current state of scientific advancements in aging research.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any mouse been reported to be nearing 2,500 days of age as of 2023-10?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no evidence to suggest that any mouse has been reported to be nearing 2,500 days of age as of 2023-10.\n\n- The Jackson Laboratory discusses the typical lifespan and aging phases of mice, indicating that mice are considered old at around 18-24 months (approximately 540-720 days), and very old beyond 24 months. This does not approach 2,500 days[5].\n- The Metaculus question discusses the possibility of a mouse living for 2,500 days but does not report any instance of this having occurred[1].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent breakthroughs in extending the lifespan of laboratory mice beyond known maximums?\nANSWER: YES, there have been recent breakthroughs in extending the lifespan of laboratory mice beyond known maximums.\n\nSeveral studies have shown significant extensions in the lifespan and healthspan of laboratory mice through various treatments:\n\n- A study published in _Nature_ found that blocking the action of the protein interleukin-11 (IL-11) extended the lifespan of mice by approximately 25%, improved their health, and reduced the incidence of cancer[1][3][4].\n\n- Another study described a treatment that involved removing highly inflammatory cells from mouse tissues, which resulted in a 9% increase in lifespan and maintained the physical function and overall health of the mice until the end of their lives[5].\n\nThese findings indicate that new therapeutic approaches are showing promise in extending both the lifespan and the healthspan of laboratory mice.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it currently considered scientifically feasible to extend a mouse's lifespan to 2,500 days with existing technologies?\nANSWER: Based on the current scientific research and technologies described in the sources, extending a mouse's lifespan to 2,500 days is not considered scientifically feasible with the existing technologies.\n\n- The average lifespan of a laboratory mouse is about 900 to 1,000 days, or approximately 2.5 years[3].\n- Current interventions, such as genetic reprogramming and activating specific brain cells, have shown modest increases in lifespan, typically in the range of 5-15% or around 60-70 days[1][3].\n- There is no evidence in the provided sources suggesting that any current technology can extend a mouse's lifespan to 2,500 days, which would be more than two and a half times the average maximum lifespan.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any laboratory mouse been reported to have lived longer than 1,800 days as of 2023-10?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication that any laboratory mouse has lived longer than 1,800 days as of 2023-10.\n\n- The UT Southwestern study mentioned that mice lived up to about 1,068 days when their low-calorie diet was restricted to the active period of their circadian cycle[1].\n- The Jackson Laboratory study found that mice on very-low-calorie diets lived up to about 34 months (approximately 1,036 days), with some living up to four and a half years (around 1,642 days), but this is still below 1,800 days[3].\n- Other studies also do not report lifespans exceeding 1,800 days[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any known interventions projected to extend mouse lifespans to 2,500 days within the next year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of any intervention that is projected to extend mouse lifespans to 2,500 days within the next year.\n\n- The studies mentioned involve various interventions such as dietary restriction of isoleucine, calorie restriction, intermittent fasting, alpha-ketoglutarate, canagliflozin, and the anti-IL-11 antibody, but none of these studies suggest achieving a lifespan of 2,500 days for mice[1][2][4].\n- The typical lifespan of mice in these studies, even with interventions, does not approach 2,500 days. For example, mice on very-low-calorie diets lived up to around 34 months (approximately 1,030 days) in one study[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent advancements in genetics or pharmacology since 2023 substantially increased the maximum lifespan of mice?\nANSWER: Recent advancements in genetics and pharmacology have shown promising results in extending the lifespan of mice, although the extent of the increase can be considered modest in some cases.\n\n- A study by Rejuvenate Bio used gene therapy to deliver Yamanaka factors (OSK) to old mice, resulting in an extension of their remaining lifespan by about 109% compared to wild-type controls. This translates to the treated mice living an additional 18 weeks on average, compared to 9 weeks for the control group[2][3][4].\n\n- Another approach involved genetically rewiring the aging circuit in simpler organisms like yeast, but while this has not been directly applied to mice, it suggests potential future strategies for more complex organisms[1].\n\nThese studies indicate that there have been substantial efforts and some successes in increasing the lifespan of mice through genetic reprogramming and gene therapy since 2023, although the long-term implications and broader applicability are still under investigation.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have credible media sources reported on mice living significantly longer than the previous maximum lifespan?\nANSWER: Yes, credible media sources have reported on mice living significantly longer than the previously known maximum lifespan through various scientific interventions.\n\n- A study reported by the University of Rochester involved the transfer of a longevity gene from naked mole rats to mice, resulting in an approximate 4.4 percent increase in median lifespan, although this is not a drastic extension, it is still an increase[2].\n\n- Another study mentioned in *Medical Xpress* and published in *Cell Metabolism* describes mice that received monthly treatments to remove highly inflammatory cells, leading some mice to live as long as 43 months. This is significantly longer than the typical maximum lifespan of mice, which is usually around 24-30 months[4].\n\n- A study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) involved lowering the expression of the mTOR gene, which extended the average lifespan of mice by about 20 percent, with some mice living up to 31.5 months[5].\n\nThese reports indicate that through genetic modifications and specific treatments, mice have been made to live longer than their typical maximum lifespan.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there ongoing scientific studies focused on significantly increasing the lifespan of mice?\nANSWER: YES, there are ongoing scientific studies focused on significantly increasing the lifespan of mice.\n\nSeveral recent studies have been conducted to explore various methods for extending the lifespan and healthspan of mice. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. **IL-11 Inhibition**: Researchers have been investigating the effects of inhibiting the inflammatory protein IL-11, which has shown to extend the healthy lifespan of mice by almost 25% and reduce age-related diseases[1][2].\n\n2. **Brain-Fat Tissue Feedback Loop**: A study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis has identified a critical communication pathway between the brain and fat tissue that, when maintained, can delay aging and extend the healthy lifespan of mice by about 7%[3][4].\n\n3. **Fasting and Calorie Restriction**: Although not as recent, studies have also explored the effects of fasting and calorie restriction on the lifespan and health of mice, showing that long periods of fasting can increase health and lifespan in male mice[5].\n\nThese studies indicate active research in the field of aging and lifespan extension in mice.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any research institutions announced developments that could lead to mice living for 2,500 days before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any research institutions announcing developments that could lead to mice living for 2,500 days before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss various topics such as the market for genetically modified mice, research fellowships, USDA and NIH budgets, and a historical mouse utopia experiment, but none of them address the specific question of mice living for 2,500 days.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is a major breakthrough in mammalian rejuvenation or anti-aging expected before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, there are significant advancements in the field of aging and rejuvenation, but whether these constitute a major breakthrough that will be fully realized or implemented before January 1, 2025, is unclear.\n\n- The Harvard Medical School, University of Maine, and MIT study published in July 2023 introduces a chemical method for reversing cellular aging, which is a significant breakthrough. However, this study is still in the preclinical phase, and human clinical trials are planned but not yet underway[2][4][5].\n- Telomir Pharmaceuticals is also working on a drug to extend telomeres and reverse aging, with plans for human clinical trials to begin in January 2025. This indicates that the major breakthroughs from these studies are still in the process of being translated into clinical applications and will not be fully realized before January 1, 2025[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as while there are promising breakthroughs, they are not expected to be fully implemented or widely available before January 1, 2025.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known**: 51 days (from November 11, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed**: The question would resolve as **No**; no mouse would be confirmed to have lived for 2,500 days before January 1, 2025.\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: With approximately 13 days left, I would forecast a probability approaching **0%**.\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4 times the time left**: With approximately 204 days left (extending to early June 2025), I would slightly increase the probability, but it would remain **extremely low**, perhaps around **1%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale**:\n\nBased on the information provided and current scientific knowledge, the maximum recorded lifespan of a laboratory mouse is approximately **1,800 days**, achieved by a growth hormone receptor knockout mouse. Normal laboratory mice, such as the C57BL/6J strain, have a maximum lifespan under ideal conditions of about **1,200 days**.\n\nThere are **no reports** of any mouse currently approaching or surpassing **2,500 days** of age. Achieving such a lifespan would require more than doubling the known maximum lifespan, which would be an **unprecedented** breakthrough in the field of aging and longevity research.\n\nRecent scientific advancements have shown **modest increases** in mouse lifespans through genetic modifications, pharmacological interventions, and caloric restriction:\n\n- **Interventions** like blocking interleukin-11 (IL-11) have extended lifespans by about **25%**, which translates to an additional **6-7.5 months** for mice, far short of the required extension to reach 2,500 days.\n- **Gene therapy** involving Yamanaka factors (OSK) has shown an extension of remaining lifespan by about **109%** in certain contexts, but this still does not approach the 2,500-day mark, and these results are preliminary and not yet replicated widely.\n\nWith only **51 days** remaining until the resolution date, it is **extremely unlikely** that a mouse could both achieve this unprecedented lifespan and be confirmed by credible media reports within this time frame.\n\nEven if there were **four times** the amount of time left (approximately **204 days**), the probability would remain very low. Significant breakthroughs in aging research typically take years to develop, validate, and report. There is also no current evidence of ongoing studies that are close to achieving such a dramatic lifespan extension in mice.\n\nGiven these factors, the possibility of an unforeseen breakthrough occurring and being reported within the limited time frame is **exceedingly small**.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 0.1%**",
