    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Sam Altman's net worth exceed $1 billion on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to his [Forbes Profile](https://www.forbes.com/profile/sam-altman/) Sam Altman's net worth is higher than $1 billion on December 31, 2024. For purposes of this question, this is defined as $1.1 billion or higher (no rounding), according to that specific resolution link. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf the resolution source is unavailable on December 31, 2024, resolution will wait until it is available (at which point it resolves based on the data shown), until January 3, 2024, at which point this question will be **annulled**. For more details on various edge cases regarding availability of or changes to the resolution source, please see Metaculus's ambiguity and annulment policies [here](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#ambiguous-annulled).  \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of October 8, 2024, Altman's net worth was listed as exactly $1 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Sam Altman's net worth will exceed $1 billion on the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List by December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Net Worth\nAs of the latest reports, Sam Altman's net worth is estimated to be between $1 and $2 billion, primarily due to his extensive investment portfolio, including stakes in companies like Stripe, Reddit, and Helion, as well as other venture investments and real estate holdings.\n\n## Potential Equity Stake in OpenAI\nOpenAI is in the process of transitioning from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation, and there have been discussions about granting Altman an equity stake in the company. If Altman were to receive a 7% equity stake, as some reports suggest, this could significantly increase his net worth, potentially to around $10 billion, given OpenAI's valuation of up to $150 billion.\n\n## Ongoing Developments at OpenAI\nThe company is currently raising new funding, which could further increase its valuation. However, it's important to note that Altman has denied any specific plans for him to receive a large equity stake, and no final decisions have been made on this matter.\n\n## Executive Turnover and Company Performance\nDespite some senior executives leaving OpenAI, the company continues to innovate and attract significant investment. The success of OpenAI's new AI models and its ongoing fundraising efforts could positively impact its valuation and, by extension, Altman's potential equity stake.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\nHistorically, the net worth of tech executives can fluctuate significantly based on the performance of their companies and the broader market. However, given the current trends in AI and the strong financial performance of OpenAI, there is a plausible scenario where Altman's net worth could increase substantially.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is not certain whether Sam Altman will receive the proposed equity stake or if OpenAI's valuation will continue to rise, the current indicators suggest a strong possibility that his net worth could exceed $1 billion by December 31, 2024. The key factors to watch include the outcome of OpenAI's restructuring, the success of its fundraising efforts, and any changes in Altman's equity holdings.\n\nGiven the available information, it is not possible to provide a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, but the likelihood of his net worth exceeding $1 billion appears to be high based on the ongoing developments and trends.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI raised additional funding in 2024 that significantly increased its valuation?\nANSWER: Yes, OpenAI has raised additional funding in 2024 that significantly increased its valuation. According to the sources, OpenAI completed a deal to raise $6.6 billion in new funding, which valued the company at $157 billion.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been confirmation of Sam Altman owning a significant percentage of OpenAI's equity?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nWhile there are discussions and considerations about giving Sam Altman a significant equity stake in OpenAI, such as a 7% stake, there has been no confirmation that this has been finalized or implemented. Altman himself has denied current plans for receiving a \"giant equity stake\" in the company, and the board has not yet made a final decision on the matter.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Sam Altman received an equity stake in OpenAI during 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no confirmation that Sam Altman has received an equity stake in OpenAI during 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- Sam Altman has denied rumors of receiving a significant equity stake in OpenAI.\n- The board of OpenAI has discussed the possibility of giving Altman an equity stake, but no specific figures have been proposed or decisions finalized.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI transitioned from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation as of November 1, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 1, 2024, OpenAI has not yet completed the transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation. The company is still in the process of considering and negotiating this change, with several complex steps and legal requirements that need to be addressed before the transition can be finalized.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any of Sam Altman's other investments significantly increased in value during 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, one of Sam Altman's other investments has significantly increased in value during 2024. His stake in Reddit, which he has held since the company's early days, has seen a substantial increase in value. Following a strong earnings report by Reddit, the company's stock price surged, making Altman's 12.2 million shares worth over $1.4 billion as of October 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Sam Altman sold any of his assets or investments in 2024 that would affect his net worth?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of Sam Altman selling any of his assets or investments in 2024 that would affect his net worth. The sources discuss his extensive investment portfolio, his net worth, and various investments he has made, but they do not indicate any sales of assets or investments in 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as there is no specific information provided about any sales of his assets or investments in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Forbes updated Sam Altman's net worth to above $1 billion at any point before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Forbes has updated Sam Altman's net worth to above $1 billion before December 31, 2024.\n\nAs of March 2024, Sam Altman's net worth was estimated to be around $2 billion, primarily from his venture capital funds related to Hydrazine Capital. This update reflects a net worth significantly above the $1 billion mark.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major investments or business ventures by Sam Altman in 2024 that could increase his net worth?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several notable investments and business ventures by Sam Altman in 2024 that could potentially increase his net worth.\n\n1. **Continued Investment Activity**: Sam Altman has remained active in investing, with multiple deals in 2024. For example, he invested in companies like GALY (Series B), Slope (Series A), ValueBase (Seed), APEX (Seed), and Exowatt (Seed) among others.\n\n2. **Large-Scale Funding Initiatives**: In February 2024, it was reported that Altman was seeking up to $7 trillion from investors to build a new manufacturer of AI chips, aiming to reduce Nvidia's dominance in the market. This ambitious project, if successful, could significantly impact his net worth.\n\n3. **Ongoing Investments in Existing Portfolios**: Altman's investments in companies like Helion Energy, Retro Biosciences, and Hermeus, which were initiated in previous years, continue to be significant. These companies are progressing in their respective fields, such as nuclear fusion, longevity, and hypersonic aviation, which could lead to increased valuations and returns.\n\nThese activities and investments suggest that Sam Altman's net worth could continue to grow through his diverse and active investment portfolio.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any legal or regulatory obstacles preventing Sam Altman from acquiring equity in OpenAI during 2024?\nANSWER: There have been several legal and regulatory obstacles and concerns surrounding Sam Altman acquiring equity in OpenAI during 2024:\n\n## Legal Challenges\n- Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, has filed lawsuits against the company, alleging that the transition from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity violates the original purpose and mission of the nonprofit. Musk claims that such a conversion is not legally permissible without violating the nonprofit's charter.\n\n## Regulatory Oversight\n- The California Attorney General's office has expressed interest in ensuring that the nonprofit's assets are protected and that any transition to a for-profit model does not undervalue the nonprofit's holdings. This oversight is aimed at safeguarding charitable assets for their intended purposes.\n\n## Governance and Valuation Issues\n- The process of transferring valuable assets from the OpenAI nonprofit to the new for-profit entity is complex and requires determining a fair valuation of these assets. Legal experts and regulators are scrutinizing this process to ensure the nonprofit receives equitable treatment, which could pose obstacles to the smooth acquisition of equity by Altman.\n\n## Nonprofit Law Considerations\n- Experts in nonprofit law have highlighted that a charity cannot simply declare itself a for-profit organization without complex negotiations and legal compliance. This involves ensuring that the nonprofit remains operational and potentially becomes a significant investor in the for-profit entity, which adds layers of complexity and potential regulatory hurdles.\n\nIn summary, while the transition is underway, it is not without significant legal, regulatory, and governance challenges that could impact Sam Altman's ability to acquire equity in OpenAI.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any setbacks or controversies affecting OpenAI's performance or valuation in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several setbacks and controversies affecting OpenAI's performance and valuation in 2024.\n\n1. **Leadership Changes and Departures**: OpenAI has experienced significant leadership upheaval, including the temporary dismissal and subsequent reinstatement of CEO Sam Altman in 2023, and the recent departures of key personnel such as Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati, Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew, and Vice President of Research Barret Zoph.\n\n2. **Financial Strains**: Despite its high valuation, OpenAI is projected to incur a substantial loss of about $5 billion in 2024, which is more than its anticipated revenue of $3.7 billion for the year. This financial strain is a significant concern for the company's long-term sustainability.\n\n3. **Complex Valuation Process**: The process of transitioning OpenAI from a non-profit to a for-profit entity is complicated by the need to establish a fair market valuation for its assets. This has led to discussions involving multiple methodologies and potential legal issues, adding uncertainty to the company's valuation.\n\n4. **Investor Skepticism**: Some investors, including Apple, have withdrawn from negotiations due to internal strife and concerns about the company's future profitability. Additionally, there is skepticism about OpenAI's ability to maintain its high valuation given its current losses and the competitive AI landscape.\n\n5. **Competition and Market Pressure**: OpenAI faces intense competition from other AI startups and tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Meta, which are also investing heavily in AI technologies. This competition, along with the high costs associated with developing and maintaining AI models, adds pressure on OpenAI's business model and profitability.\n\n6. **Conditions on Investors**: OpenAI has imposed conditions on its investors, including not investing in rival companies such as xAI and Safe Superintelligence, which has drawn criticism and highlighted the competitive tensions in the AI sector.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are **two months** remaining until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, Sam Altman's net worth would remain at **$1 billion** according to his Forbes profile, which is **below** the $1.1 billion threshold. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only **half a month** (approximately 15 days) left until December 31, 2024, the probability of his net worth exceeding $1.1 billion would be **lower** due to limited time for significant changes or updates.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were **eight months** remaining until December 31, 2024, the probability would be **higher**, given more time for potential increases in net worth and updates by Forbes.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSam Altman's net worth is currently listed as **$1 billion** on his [Forbes profile](https://www.forbes.com/profile/sam-altman/). To resolve **Yes**, his net worth needs to be updated to **$1.1 billion or higher** by December 31, 2024.\n\nSeveral factors influence this prediction:\n\n1. **Increase in Value of Reddit Stake:**\n   - Altman holds **12.2 million shares** in Reddit.\n   - As of October 2024, Reddit's stock price surged after a strong earnings report.\n   - His stake is now worth over **$1.4 billion**.\n   - However, Forbes has not yet updated his net worth to reflect this increase.\n\n2. **Potential Equity in OpenAI:**\n   - Discussions about granting Altman a significant equity stake in OpenAI are ongoing.\n   - Legal and regulatory obstacles are delaying this process.\n   - No confirmation or finalized decisions have been made.\n\n3. **Other Investments and Ventures:**\n   - Altman has made multiple investments in 2024 (e.g., GALY, Slope, ValueBase).\n   - These investments could positively impact his net worth, but gains may not be immediate.\n\n4. **Setbacks and Controversies:**\n   - OpenAI faces financial strains and leadership changes.\n   - These issues may indirectly affect Altman's net worth.\n\n5. **Forbes' Update Frequency:**\n   - Forbes may update net worth figures periodically.\n   - With only two months left, there's uncertainty whether the increased value of his assets will be reflected by December 31.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the substantial increase in the value of Sam Altman's Reddit shares, there's a **moderate likelihood** that Forbes will update his net worth to exceed $1.1 billion by the end of the year. However, the lack of a current update and the short time frame reduce the probability.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 55%**",
