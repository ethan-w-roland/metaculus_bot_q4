    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill any more of Trump's announced Cabinet picks drop out before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-03\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if after November 27, 2024 and before January 1, 2025, any announced Cabinet member or Cabinet-level official withdraws as a nominee, or Donald Trump or his transition team retracts any nomination.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- The nomination need not have happened before this question opened. For example, a Cabinet nomination that is announced in December and withdrawn before 2025 would still resolve this question as **Yes**.\n- For purposes of this question we are defining Cabinet and Cabinet-level as the following 26 positions, and any withdrawal of a nomination for any of the positions will resolve this question as **Yes**:\n    - Secretary of State\n    - Secretary of the Treasury\n    - Secretary of Defense\n    - Attorney General\n    - Secretary of the Interior\n    - Secretary of Agriculture\n    - Secretary of Commerce\n    - Secretary of Labor\n    - Secretary of Health and Human Services\n    - Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\n    - Secretary of Transportation\n    - Secretary of Energy\n    - Secretary of Education\n    - Secretary of Veterans Affairs\n    - Secretary of Homeland Security\n    - White House Chief of Staff\n    - Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency\n    - Director of the Office of Management and Budget\n    - Director of National Intelligence\n    - Director of the Central Intelligence Agency\n    - United States Trade Representative\n    - Ambassador to the United Nations\n    - Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers\n    - Administrator of the Small Business Administration\n    - Science Advisor to the President\n    - Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFollowing his recent electoral victory, President-elect Donald Trump has announced all 15 of the federal department heads and 5 more \"Cabinet-level\" officials. Matt Gaetz, who was initially nominated for Attorney General, [withdrew his nomination](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99r2m4y2zro) on November 21, 2024, amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Other nominees, such as [Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/25/nx-s1-5204486/president-elect-trump-reveals-more-people-he-wants-serving-in-his-cabinet) have also faced scrutiny due to various allegations.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of any more of Trump's announced Cabinet picks dropping out before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Precedent and Current Context\n- Cabinet nominations can be volatile, especially when nominees face controversy or scrutiny. For example, Matt Gaetz, Trump's initial pick for Attorney General, withdrew from consideration due to allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use[1][3][5].\n\n## Current Controversies and Vetting Process\n- Several of Trump's nominees are facing significant scrutiny. Pete Hegseth, nominated for Defense Secretary, has faced allegations of sexual assault and alcohol abuse, which could impact his confirmation process[4].\n- The issue of FBI background checks for Trump's nominees is currently a point of debate, with Democrats emphasizing the importance of thorough vetting and Republicans working to resolve the impasse. This could potentially lead to additional nominees facing increased scrutiny or dropping out[4].\n\n## Recent Developments\n- The recent withdrawal of Matt Gaetz and the swift announcement of a new nominee (Pam Bondi) indicate that Trump's team is prepared to make changes if necessary. This sets a precedent that other nominees could also withdraw if they face insurmountable opposition or personal issues[1][3].\n\n## Base Rates\n- Historically, it is not uncommon for Cabinet nominees to face challenges that lead to their withdrawal. The base rate of nominees dropping out due to various reasons (scandals, health issues, political opposition) suggests that it is a plausible outcome.\n\n## Time to Resolution\n- With the confirmation process ongoing and the inauguration date set for January 20, 2025, there is still time for additional nominees to face significant challenges that could lead to their withdrawal before January 1, 2025.\n\nGiven these points, while it is impossible to predict with certainty whether any more nominees will drop out, the current context and historical precedents suggest that it is a possibility that should be considered. The ongoing controversies and the importance of the vetting process add to the uncertainty surrounding the stability of the current list of nominees.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any of Trump's Cabinet nominees publicly stated an intention to withdraw?\nANSWER: Yes, one of Trump's Cabinet nominees has publicly stated an intention to withdraw. Chad Chronister, who was nominated to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, withdrew his name from consideration, citing his desire to continue serving as the Sheriff of Hillsborough County in Florida[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Pete Hegseth still actively serving as the nominee for Secretary of Defense?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Pete Hegseth has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as the Secretary of Defense, but there is no indication that he has been confirmed or that the nomination process has been completed. Therefore, as of the current information, he is still the nominee.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any of Trump's Cabinet nominees failed to pass FBI background checks?\nANSWER: Based on the provided source, it does not explicitly state whether any of Trump's Cabinet nominees failed to pass FBI background checks. The source discusses a proposal to replace FBI background checks and the rejection of that proposal by GOP senators, but it does not provide information on the outcomes of the background checks themselves.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any additional Trump Cabinet nominees withdrawn as of December 3, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, as of December 3, 2024, multiple Trump Cabinet nominees have withdrawn from consideration.\n\n- Chad Chronister, the nominee for the Drug Enforcement Administration, withdrew his name from consideration on December 3, 2024[2][4].\n- Matt Gaetz, the initial pick for Attorney General, had previously withdrawn due to a federal sex trafficking investigation[1][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump's transition team expressed concerns about any of the current Cabinet nominees?\nANSWER: YES\n\nDonald Trump's transition team has expressed concerns about the current Cabinet nominees, specifically regarding the bomb threats and swatting incidents targeted at several of the president-elect's appointees, including Cabinet nominees. The transition team described these threats as “violent” and “unAmerican” and emphasized the quick response of law enforcement to ensure their safety[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there ongoing legal investigations involving any of Trump's Cabinet nominees?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of ongoing legal investigations specifically involving Trump's Cabinet nominees. However, there are mentions of various issues and controversies surrounding some of the nominees:\n\n- There are allegations of past sexual misconduct against defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, which have prompted bipartisan concern but are not described as part of an ongoing legal investigation[2][3].\n- The sources discuss debates and concerns about the vetting process, including background checks, but do not indicate active legal investigations against the nominees[2][3].\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are any of Trump's current Cabinet nominees facing serious allegations of misconduct?\nANSWER: YES\n\nSeveral of President-elect Donald Trump’s current Cabinet nominees are facing serious allegations of misconduct, including sexual misconduct and assault. For example:\n\n- Pete Hegseth, nominated to lead the Department of Defense, has been accused of sexually assaulting a staff member of the California Federation of Republican Women in 2017[1][2].\n- Matt Gaetz, who was under consideration for a Cabinet position before withdrawing, has faced allegations of sex trafficking and having sex with a minor. Although he has denied all wrongdoing, these allegations have been investigated by the Justice Department and a congressional committee[1].\n\nThese allegations highlight the serious misconduct concerns surrounding some of Trump's nominees.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the current Senate majority oppose the confirmation of any Trump Cabinet nominees?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the current Senate majority as a whole opposes the confirmation of any Trump Cabinet nominees. Instead, the sources highlight discussions and debates about the vetting process for these nominees, particularly regarding FBI background checks.\n\n- Senate Republicans are emphasizing the importance of thorough vetting, but they are not ruling out alternative methods to the traditional FBI background checks[2][3].\n- Democrats are pushing for full FBI background investigations, but this does not constitute opposition from the Senate majority, which is currently Republican[2][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there major political obstacles in the Senate against confirming Trump's Cabinet nominees?\nANSWER: Yes, there are major political obstacles in the Senate against confirming Trump's Cabinet nominees.\n\nSeveral factors indicate potential opposition:\n- Some of Trump's nominees have been controversial, such as Matt Gaetz, who withdrew his nomination for attorney general due to sex trafficking allegations[2][3].\n- Republican senators like Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnell, and Thom Tillis may pose opposition. For example, Susan Collins had reservations about Gaetz's nomination and has shown opposition to some of Trump's other nominees in the past[1].\n- The Senate, although controlled by Republicans with a 53-seat majority, still requires confirmation for most of Trump's Cabinet picks, and some Republican senators may not support all of the nominees due to various reasons, including controversy surrounding some of the nominees[1][2][3].\n\nThese factors suggest that there will be significant scrutiny and potential opposition during the confirmation process.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any of Trump's Cabinet nominees been involved in recent media scandals?\nANSWER: Yes, several of Trump's Cabinet nominees have been involved in recent media scandals.\n\n- Pete Hegseth, the nominee for secretary of defense, has been accused of locking a woman in his hotel room and assaulting her at a Republican women's event in 2017. Although he and his lawyer claim the encounter was consensual, the incident has been widely reported[2][4].\n\n- Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the nominee for health and human services secretary, has been accused by a former family nanny of groping her in 1999. Kennedy responded to the allegation, but no charges were filed[2].\n\n- Linda McMahon, the nominee for education secretary, is involved in a lawsuit claiming she failed to stop an employee at World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) from sexually abusing young boys. The allegations are denied by her lawyer[2].\n\n- Matt Gaetz, who was initially considered for the U.S. attorney general position, is under investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. He has denied any wrongdoing but faced significant media scrutiny[2][3].\n\n- Elon Musk, who has been tapped to help lead an advisory panel on government efficiency, is involved in a lawsuit by former SpaceX employees alleging a hostile workplace environment with lewd sexual banter and mistreatment of women[2].\n\nThese incidents have all been reported in recent media coverage.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n28 days (from December 3, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf the current trend continues without any new developments, the outcome would remain **Yes** since at least one nominee (Chad Chronister) has already withdrawn. However, if interpreting \"more\" as additional withdrawals beyond the already occurred ones, the outcome would remain **Yes** unless no further withdrawals occur, which would still satisfy the condition for a \"Yes.\"\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately one week left, the probability of additional withdrawals would be lower, as most major decisions and potential withdrawals are likely to have already occurred.  \n**Forecast Probability:** 60%\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith an extended timeframe of about four months, there would be significantly more opportunities for nominees to face scrutiny, controversies, or personal decisions leading to withdrawals. This increased time frame would heighten the likelihood of additional drops.  \n**Forecast Probability:** 80%\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAs of December 3, 2024, there have already been notable withdrawals among Trump's Cabinet nominees, including Matt Gaetz and Chad Chronister. The recent pattern indicates a degree of instability within the nomination process, influenced by controversies and allegations surrounding several nominees. Given the ongoing scrutiny, media attention, and political opposition, especially from within the Senate, there remains a substantial risk of further withdrawals in the remaining month before January 1, 2025. Historical precedents also suggest that Cabinet nominations can be volatile, particularly under contentious political climates. While the majority of major nominations may have been addressed by this point, the possibility of late-stage withdrawals cannot be discounted, especially as the confirmation processes continue and any new information or developments arise.\n\n**Probability:** 70%",
