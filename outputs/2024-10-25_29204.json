{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapse before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2025, any of the following occur before the merger deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel has been fulfilled:\n\n- The sitting U.S. President issues an executive order blocking the deal\n- U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel jointly announce the deal's cancellation\n- Either U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel unilaterally terminates the deal\n- Either U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel files an SEC Form 8-K announcing the merger agreement's termination or abandonment.\n\nIf none of these have occurred before January 1, 2025, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nSubsequent legal actions (e.g., lawsuits appealing an executive order) do not affect the resolution of this question.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe CFIUS recommendation does not directly impact the resolution of this question, even if the CFIUS recommends blocking the deal, as it lacks enforcement authority.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel):\n\n>On December 18, 2023, Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC), the world's third largest steel producer, entered a definitive agreement to purchase United States Steel Corporation (U.S. Steel) for $14.9 billion. Under the terms of the deal, U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of NSC but retain its name and headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania [...].\n\n>The potential foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, which is widely considered an icon of American industry, has generated controversy in the U.S. The White House, lawmakers from both major parties, and the USW have criticized or opposed the deal due to concerns about its impact on workers, supply chains, and national security. Conversely, the transaction has garnered support from various government officials, policy experts, and business analysts, who argue that it will help revitalize U.S. Steel and the country's declining steel industry and counter that Japan is a major economic partner and investor.\n\n>On March 14, 2024, the Biden Administration announced its opposition to the planned acquisition, echoing a statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to block the deal \"instantaneously\" if elected president in the upcoming 2024 presidential elections. The deal is undergoing an antitrust review by the U.S. Department of Justice, and a possible investigation by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Nippon Steel has subsequently delayed its timeline for closing the deal from the middle of 2024 towards the end of the year.\n\nCFIUS let the companies [refile their application](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/us-decision-nippons-bid-us-steel-pushed-back-until-after-election-2024-09-17/) in September, which sets a new deadline in December for the CFIUS to make a decision.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapsing before January 1, 2025, here are some key points and context that could influence the outcome:\n\n## Regulatory Approval\nThe merger is currently delayed due to a request from the U.S. Department of Justice for additional documentation, pushing the expected closing from September to December 2024.\nA national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) is also ongoing, and this process could take several months or even longer.\n\n## Political Opposition\nThe deal faces significant opposition from the Biden administration and other political figures, including former President Trump, on economic and national security grounds. President Biden is considering formally blocking the deal, which could be a critical factor in its outcome.\n\n## Shareholder Approval\nDespite the regulatory and political hurdles, the merger has been approved by over 98% of U.S. Steel's shareholders, indicating strong support from the company's investors.\n\n## Economic and National Security Concerns\nConcerns about the deal's impact on U.S. national security, the steel industry's competitiveness, and the potential for reduced tariffs on foreign steel imports are being closely examined. These concerns could lead to further delays or even the blocking of the deal.\n\n## Time to Resolution\nGiven the current delays and the ongoing regulatory reviews, it is plausible that the merger could be resolved or blocked before January 1, 2025. However, the exact timeline is uncertain and depends on the outcomes of the regulatory and political processes.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\nHistorically, large mergers involving foreign entities and significant national security implications can be complex and often face lengthy review periods. The involvement of multiple regulatory bodies and high-level political opposition increases the uncertainty around the deal's completion.\n\nIn summary, while the merger has strong shareholder support, it faces substantial regulatory and political hurdles. The likelihood of the merger collapsing before January 1, 2025, cannot be definitively determined as of now, but the ongoing delays and opposition suggest that the outcome is far from certain.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel publicly indicated an intention to terminate their merger agreement as of October 25, 2024?\nANSWER: No, as of October 25, 2024, there is no indication from the provided sources that U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel has publicly stated an intention to terminate their merger agreement. Instead, the sources discuss ongoing efforts to complete the transaction, regulatory reviews, and political opposition, but do not mention any intention to terminate the agreement.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Biden formally declared an intention to issue an executive order blocking the U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel merger?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden is reportedly preparing to block the merger between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, and has expressed his opposition to the deal, there is no indication that he has formally declared an intention to issue an executive order to block the merger at this point. The decision is still pending the recommendations from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and Biden has 15 days to announce a decision once he receives those recommendations.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have U.S. Steel's major shareholders withdrawn their support for the merger since their initial approval?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that U.S. Steel's major shareholders have withdrawn their support for the merger since their initial approval.\n\n- The sources confirm that U.S. Steel stockholders overwhelmingly voted to approve the proposed merger with Nippon Steel Corporation, with more than 98% of the shares voted in favor.\n- There is no mention of any major shareholders reversing their support after the initial approval.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent statements or reports suggesting significant delays that would push the merger's completion past January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no recent statements or reports suggesting significant delays that would push the merger's completion past January 1, 2025, specifically in the context of the merger review process.\n\n- The sources discuss upcoming changes to the HSR rules and bank merger regulations, but they do not indicate any expected delays beyond the planned implementation dates. For example, the new HSR rules are expected to go into effect in mid-to-late January 2025, assuming no legal challenges.\n- There is no mention of general or widespread delays that would affect the completion of mergers past January 1, 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) completed its review of the merger with a recommendation against the deal?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has completed its review of the specific merger in question with a recommendation against the deal.\n\nThe sources discuss the general process and authority of CFIUS, the recent enhancements to its regulations, and the potential for CFIUS to block deals due to national security concerns. However, they do not provide specific information about the outcome of the CFIUS review for the particular merger involving Nippon and U.S. Steel.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit or taken formal action to block the U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel merger?\nANSWER: As of the latest information available, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has not filed a lawsuit or taken formal action to block the U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel merger. The DOJ has initiated an in-depth antitrust investigation into the merger, which includes requesting additional documentation and engaging with industry participants to assess potential competitive issues.\n\nHowever, the formal decision to block the merger, if it were to happen, would more likely come through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) on national security grounds, rather than through a DOJ antitrust lawsuit. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel merger still scheduled to close before January 1, 2025, according to the latest company statements?\nANSWER: Based on the latest company statements, the U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel merger is still intended to close before January 1, 2025, but it is subject to the fulfillment of remaining regulatory approvals.\n\n- U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel currently expect the transaction to be completed in the second half of 2024, subject to the receipt of required U.S. regulatory approvals.\n- Despite ongoing regulatory reviews and opposition, the companies continue to work toward closing the transaction by the end of this year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Biden issued an executive order blocking a merger or acquisition involving a foreign company in the past five years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no direct evidence that President Biden has issued an executive order specifically to block a merger or acquisition involving a foreign company. However, the sources do indicate that President Biden has taken actions to enhance the scrutiny and regulation of foreign investments through various executive orders.\n\nFor example, Executive Order 14083 directs the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to consider additional national security factors when evaluating foreign investment transactions, which could potentially lead to the prohibition or divestiture of transactions that pose national security risks.\n\nWhile these orders strengthen the review process and enforcement guidelines for foreign investments, they do not specifically mention President Biden issuing an executive order to block a particular merger or acquisition involving a foreign company.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** based on the provided sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have similar mergers involving foreign acquisitions in sensitive industries been blocked in the U.S. during the past few years?\nANSWER: Yes, similar mergers involving foreign acquisitions in sensitive industries have been blocked or subject to significant scrutiny in the U.S. during the past few years.\n\n- In May 2024, President Biden ordered a PRC cryptocurrency mining firm, MineOne Wyoming Data Center LLC, to divest its real estate acquisition and operations located near Francis E. Warren Air Force Base due to national security concerns.\n- There have been historical instances where foreign acquisitions were blocked, such as the blocking of Aixtron SE's acquisition by Grand Chip (China IC Fund) in 2016 and Lattice Semiconductor's acquisition by Canyon Bridge Capital Partners in 2017, both in the semiconductor sector.\n- Additionally, there are ongoing considerations and potential blocks, such as the proposed acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel, which is under review by CFIUS and may be blocked due to national security and political concerns.\n\nThese examples illustrate the heightened scrutiny and occasional blocking of foreign acquisitions in sensitive industries to protect U.S. national security.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any new legal obstacles emerged that make the completion of the merger before January 1, 2025 unlikely?\nANSWER: Several new legal and procedural changes have been introduced or are set to be implemented, which could potentially create obstacles or delays for mergers, making completion before January 1, 2025, more challenging.\n\n## U.S. Antitrust Reforms\n- The FTC has issued final changes to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act (HSR) rules, which will take effect in January 2025. These changes will significantly increase the time and cost required for most HSR filings, especially for transactions involving overlaps or vertical relationships. This could delay the review process for mergers.\n\n## Australian Merger Control Reforms\n- Australia is transitioning to a mandatory merger control regime starting from January 1, 2026, but there are transitional arrangements that could affect transactions in the second half of 2025. Parties transacting during this period need to monitor their closing dates and determine if they are caught by the new regime, which could introduce delays.\n\n## UK Merger Control Updates\n- The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has updated its merger control thresholds and introduced a new fast-track procedure, but also allows for extensions in the review process, which could add uncertainty and potential delays for merging parties.\n\nGiven these changes, especially the increased complexity and time requirements for HSR filings in the U.S. and the transitional uncertainties in Australia, it is likely that the completion of some mergers before January 1, 2025, could be made more difficult.\n\n**YES**", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nFrom October 25, 2024, to January 1, 2025, there are approximately **68 days** remaining.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changes between now and January 1, 2025, the merger between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel would proceed as planned. None of the specified conditions for the merger collapsing would occur. Therefore, the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 17 days):**\n\nWith only 17 days left until January 1, 2025, and assuming current conditions remain the same, the likelihood of the merger collapsing before the deadline would be lower due to the limited time for any regulatory or political intervention. I would forecast a **40%** probability of the merger collapsing.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left (approximately 272 days):**\n\nWith 272 days remaining, there is significantly more time for potential regulatory actions, political decisions, or company changes that could lead to the merger collapsing. I would forecast a **75%** probability of the merger collapsing in that extended timeframe.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe probability of the U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel merger collapsing before January 1, 2025, hinges on several critical factors:\n\n1. **Regulatory and Political Opposition:**\n   - **Biden Administration's Stance:** The Biden administration has publicly opposed the merger due to concerns over national security, economic impact, and the strategic importance of the steel industry. While President Biden has not yet formally declared an intention to issue an executive order blocking the deal, the strong opposition increases the likelihood of intervention.\n   - **CFIUS Review:** The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is conducting a national security review of the merger. The review has been extended, with a new deadline set in December 2024. A negative recommendation from CFIUS could prompt the President to block the deal.\n   - **DOJ Antitrust Investigation:** The Department of Justice is performing an in-depth antitrust review. While no formal action has been taken to block the merger, the investigation adds uncertainty and could result in legal challenges.\n\n2. **Historical Precedents:**\n   - Mergers involving foreign acquisitions in sensitive industries, such as technology or defense, have been blocked in the past due to national security concerns. This precedent suggests a higher risk for the current merger.\n   - Examples include the blocking of Broadcom's attempt to acquire Qualcomm in 2018 and other deals involving critical infrastructure or technology companies.\n\n3. **Time Constraints:**\n   - With approximately two months remaining, there is sufficient time for significant regulatory actions or executive decisions to occur.\n   - The expected decision from CFIUS in December aligns closely with the deadline, increasing the urgency and potential impact.\n\n4. **Company Positions and Shareholder Support:**\n   - **Company Commitment:** Both U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel have not indicated any intention to terminate the merger agreement. They are actively working toward completing the transaction.\n   - **Shareholder Approval:** The merger has received overwhelming support from U.S. Steel shareholders, with over 98% voting in favor.\n\n5. **Legal and Regulatory Changes:**\n   - **No New Legal Obstacles Identified:** There are no new legal changes that explicitly make the completion of the merger before January 1, 2025, unlikely. However, the regulatory environment is stringent, and upcoming changes to merger control rules (effective after the deadline) reflect increased scrutiny.\n   - **Potential for Delays:** While procedural delays are possible, there is no clear indication that the merger cannot close before the deadline due to legal obstacles alone.\n\n6. **Political Climate:**\n   - Bipartisan concerns about foreign ownership of critical industries may influence the administration's decision-making.\n   - Upcoming elections and political considerations might prompt decisive action to block the merger to align with national interests and public sentiment.\n\n**Weighing the Factors:**\n\n- **Factors Increasing the Probability of Collapse:**\n  - Strong political opposition and potential for executive action.\n  - Historical precedent of blocking similar mergers.\n  - Pending CFIUS review with national security implications.\n  - DOJ antitrust investigation adding legal uncertainty.\n\n- **Factors Decreasing the Probability of Collapse:**\n  - Firm commitment from both companies to proceed.\n  - Strong shareholder support.\n  - Limited time frame reduces the window for action, though significant decisions are expected soon.\n  - No explicit new legal obstacles blocking completion before January 1, 2025.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the substantial political and regulatory headwinds, the probability that the merger will collapse before January 1, 2025, is significant. The upcoming CFIUS decision and potential executive action are critical factors that could lead to the merger's collapse within the remaining timeframe. However, the companies' commitment and lack of a formal blocking action to date suggest that the outcome is not certain.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 65%**", "probability": 65}
