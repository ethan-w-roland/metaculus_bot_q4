{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill RCP's polling bias for Trump based on national polls in the month before the 2024 election be greater than or equal to -2.0 and less than or equal to -1.0 percentage points?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThe question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump's national polling bias when using the October 17 [RealClear Polling (RCP) average](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris) of a -1.583 percentage point spread (Trump) is greater than or equal to -2.0 pp and less than or equal to -1.0 pp. \n\nThis will be calculated as -1.583 percentage points (pp), minus Trump's popular vote percentage (expressed in pp), plus Harris' popular vote percentage (in pp).\n\nBACKGROUND:\nPolling bias is calculated by subtracting the actual voting percentage spread from the pre-election polled percentage spread of the candidate in question. For example, [Activote's](https://www.activote.net/polling-analysis/) national 2020 poll reported Trump trailing Biden by a 6 percentage point spread. The actual election resulted in 51.31% votes for Biden and 46.85% for Trump, a -4.46pp spread. Trump's polling bias was then \\(-6pp-(-4.46pp) = -1.54pp \\).\n\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/) estimated a polling bias of +4.1pp for the Biden in 2020 and +3.3pp for Clinton in 2016. However, it found almost no weighted-average polling bias in the 2022 midterm election. The \"shy Trump voter hypothesis\" suggests one possible reason for the bias in 2016 and 2020 is that Trump voters were reluctant to respond or respond accurately to the polls. Authors from [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/11/02/shy-trump-voters-myth/), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/1/21544644/shy-trump-voters-polling-error-explained), and others have questioned this hypothesis.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the RealClearPolitics (RCP) polling bias for Trump based on national polls in the month before the 2024 election will be within the range of -2.0 to -1.0 percentage points, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context\n- In the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, polls consistently underestimated Trump's support. In 2016, national polls underestimated Trump's performance by about 1.1 points, and in 2020, they underestimated it by about 2.7 points.\n- However, the 2022 midterms showed a different trend, where polls actually overestimated Republican performance in some swing states, suggesting a potential pro-Republican bias in those elections.\n\n## Current Polling Dynamics\n- The current polls indicate a very close race between Trump and Kamala Harris, with margins in key battleground states often within a single percentage point.\n- There are concerns about nonresponse bias, particularly among Trump supporters who may be less inclined to participate in polls due to distrust of institutions like pollsters and journalists.\n\n## Polling Methodologies\n- Pollsters have made efforts to learn from past mistakes, such as adjusting for turnout estimates and improving methods to reach harder-to-survey populations like rural and exurban voters. However, there is still uncertainty about whether these adjustments will be sufficient.\n\n## Possible Scenarios\n- One scenario suggests that if the historical pattern of Trump outperforming polls continues, the bias could be in the range of -1 to -1.5 points, as seen in previous elections.\n- Another scenario suggests that pollsters might overcompensate for past biases, potentially leading to a smaller or even positive bias for Trump.\n\nGiven these points, while it is plausible that the polling bias could fall within the range of -2.0 to -1.0 percentage points, it is not clear whether this will be the case. The historical data and current polling dynamics suggest several possible outcomes, and the actual bias could vary based on various factors, including changes in polling methodologies and voter behavior.\n\nTherefore, the question cannot be answered with certainty as a yes or no based on the available information. The outcome depends on multiple variables that are still in flux as the election approaches.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did national polls in the 2020 U.S. presidential election underestimate Donald Trump's support by more than 2 percentage points?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe national polls in the 2020 U.S. presidential election underestimated Donald Trump's support by more than 2 percentage points. According to the reports, the polls overstated Joe Biden\u2019s lead by an average of 3.9 percentage points, which indicates that Trump's support was underestimated by a similar margin.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do current RealClearPolitics national polls for the 2024 election suggest a polling bias similar to previous elections?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not offer direct evidence or analysis regarding polling bias in the current 2024 election polls compared to previous elections. The polls listed on RealClearPolitics and RealClearPolling present various results from different polling organizations, but they do not include an analysis of polling bias or comparisons to previous election polling accuracy.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, it is **UNCLEAR** whether the current national polls for the 2024 election suggest a polling bias similar to previous elections.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump consistently outperformed RealClearPolitics' polling averages in past elections?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is clear that Donald Trump has often performed better in actual election outcomes than what the polling averages predicted in past elections.\n\n- In the 2016 election, polling averages underestimated Trump's support, and he won the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote.\n- In the 2020 election, polling averages also tended to skew in favor of the Democratic candidate, and while Biden won, the margins were closer than many polls suggested.\n\nThis pattern of polling underestimating Trump's support is highlighted in several sources, indicating that Trump has consistently outperformed the polling averages in past elections. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current national polls for the 2024 election showing a similar pattern of underestimating Donald Trump's support as in 2016 and 2020?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence to suggest that current national polls for the 2024 election are underestimating Donald Trump's support in the same way they did in 2016 and 2020.\n\nWhile the sources do mention that polls in the past (2016 and 2020) underestimated Trump's support, they do not indicate that this is currently happening in the 2024 polls. Instead, they focus on the tight and statistically tied nature of the current race between Trump and Kamala Harris, without suggesting any systematic underestimation of Trump's support.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether current national polls are showing a similar pattern of underestimating Donald Trump's support as in 2016 and 2020 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did RealClearPolitics' polling average in the 2020 election have a polling bias for Trump between -2.0 and -1.0 percentage points?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, the RealClearPolitics (RCP) polling average in the 2020 election did not exhibit a polling bias in favor of Trump within the range of -2.0 to -1.0 percentage points.\n\nInstead, the analysis indicates that the RCP Poll Averages were more accurate and did not favor Trump. In fact, the RCP averages were shown to be more accurate than many other polls, especially in the battleground states, and they did not skew significantly towards Trump. The error in the RCP Poll Averages in the seven closest states was only 1.47 points, and when excluding Wisconsin, the error was even lower at 0.72 points.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the polling bias in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections show a reduced underestimation of Republican support compared to previous elections?\nANSWER: The polling bias in the 2022 U.S. midterm elections did show a reduced underestimation of Republican support compared to previous elections.\n\n- According to FiveThirtyEight, the polls in the 2021-22 cycle had a weighted-average bias of just D+0.8, which is significantly lower than the biases observed in the 2016 and 2020 cycles (D+3.0 and D+4.7, respectively).\n- Data for Progress also reported that their polling showed a 1.9-point average bias toward overestimating Republican vote share, indicating a shift away from the previous biases that favored Democrats.\n\nThese findings suggest that the polling bias in 2022 was more balanced and did not underestimate Republican support to the same extent as in previous cycles.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence that the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon is still affecting poll responses in 2024?\nANSWER: The evidence on whether the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon is still affecting poll responses in 2024 is mixed and not conclusive.\n\n### Arguments Against the Phenomenon:\n- A report from Morning Consult suggests that polling methods have improved, particularly by weighting surveys on recalled 2020 vote choice, which may better capture Trump's actual level of support. This implies that the \"shy Trump voter\" effect might be less significant in 2024.\n- Pew Research Center and other studies have found little to no evidence to support the \"shy Trump\" theory in past elections. Instead, they attribute polling errors to other factors such as difficulty in estimating turnout and partisan nonresponse bias.\n\n### Arguments For the Phenomenon:\n- Some analysts, like Doug Schoen, suggest that \"shy Trump voters\" could still be a factor, citing past instances where Trump received more votes than polls predicted. This could indicate that some Trump supporters remain reluctant to express their support publicly.\n- Another article mentions that the social and cultural environment, particularly the increased stigma associated with supporting Trump, might continue to encourage some voters to remain silent about their support.\n\nGiven these conflicting views and the lack of definitive evidence one way or the other, the answer to whether the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon is still affecting poll responses in 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have polling methodologies been significantly adjusted since the 2020 election to account for past biases?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nSince the 2020 election, polling methodologies have undergone significant adjustments to address past biases and improve accuracy.\n\n- Many pollsters have changed their methods, with 37% of national pollsters altering how they sample or interview people between 2020 and 2022, which is a higher rate of change than after the 2016 election.\n- There has been an increase in the use of multiple methods, such as online surveys, text messaging, and probability-based panels, to better represent the electorate.\n- Efforts have been made to address nonresponse bias, particularly among certain groups of voters, such as Trump supporters who may be less inclined to participate in polls. Pollsters are now using various techniques, including weighting by educational background and recalled vote, to ensure more accurate representation.\n- There is a greater emphasis on transparency in polling methodologies and on using a combination of approaches to engage with a broader range of voters, rather than relying on a single method.\n\nThese changes reflect a continuous effort to refine and improve polling methodologies in response to the challenges identified in the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are polling errors generally declining in recent U.S. elections due to methodological improvements?\nANSWER: The evidence suggests that while there have been some methodological improvements in polling, the overall trend of polling errors is not consistently declining.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n- Despite methodological adjustments, such as weighting surveys based on past voting behavior and adjusting for demographics like education, polling errors have persisted, particularly in presidential elections involving Donald Trump. The 2020 polls, for example, had the highest error in 40 years for the national popular vote and the highest in at least 20 years for state-level estimates.\n\n- Polls have performed better in midterm elections, such as in 2018 and 2022, but this does not necessarily translate to improved accuracy in presidential elections.\n\n- Issues like nonresponse bias, where certain groups (notably Trump supporters) are less likely to participate in polls, and other sources of error such as noncoverage and measurement errors, continue to affect polling accuracy.\n\n- While some improvements have been made, such as adjusting for education and past voting behavior, the underlying problems that led to significant errors in 2016 and 2020 have not been fully resolved.\n\nTherefore, it is unclear whether polling errors are generally declining due to methodological improvements, especially given the ongoing challenges and inconsistencies in polling accuracy. The answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant nonresponse bias among Trump supporters in current polling data?\nANSWER: The question of whether there is significant nonresponse bias among Trump supporters in current polling data is a complex one, and the sources provide several insights but do not offer a definitive answer.\n\n1. **Nonresponse Bias**: Multiple sources suggest that nonresponse bias could be a factor. For example, the FiveThirtyEight analysis indicates that certain Trump-leaning voters, particularly those who get their news from social media or do not consume political news, are less likely to participate in follow-up surveys.\n2. **Historical Context**: The 2020 election saw significant nonresponse bias, with Trump supporters being less inclined to participate in polls, which led to their underrepresentation in polling data.\n3. **Current Concerns**: Experts continue to caution that the same nonresponse bias may still be relevant in the 2024 election. Trump supporters' skepticism towards institutions like pollsters and journalists, reinforced by Trump's public statements, could contribute to this bias.\n\nHowever, it is also noted that:\n- Pollsters have implemented adjustments to mitigate this bias, such as using appropriate weighting techniques.\n- The evidence is not conclusive, and the impact of nonresponse bias can vary depending on the specific polling methods and the demographic composition of the electorate.\n\nGiven this information, while there are strong indications that nonresponse bias among Trump supporters could still be an issue, it is not possible to state definitively that it is significant in current polling data without more specific and up-to-date evidence.\n\n**UNCLEAR**", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of 2024-10-22, the U.S. presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. The final popular vote counts are typically certified and available within a few weeks after the election. Therefore, the outcome will be known in approximately 1 to 1.5 months.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed from historical patterns and current dynamics, the polling bias for Trump would likely fall within the range of -2.0 to -1.0 percentage points. In the 2016 and 2020 elections, national polls underestimated Trump's support by approximately 1.1 and 2.7 percentage points, respectively. Given that pollsters have been adjusting methodologies to account for previous biases\u2014such as weighting for education and adjusting for turnout\u2014it's plausible that the bias will be reduced compared to 2020 but may still exist due to persistent challenges like nonresponse bias among certain voter groups. Therefore, the outcome would likely be **Yes**, with the polling bias falling within the specified range.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only about two weeks remaining until the election, there would be less time for significant changes in polling methodologies, voter sentiment, or external events that could affect the polling bias. Given the historical data and assuming current trends hold steady, I would forecast a higher probability that the polling bias will fall within the -2.0 to -1.0 percentage point range. My forecast in this scenario would be a probability of **75%**.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately six months left until the election, there would be greater uncertainty. Longer time frames allow for more variables that could impact polling accuracy, such as changes in candidate popularity, major national or global events, or further adjustments in polling methodologies. Pollsters might implement new techniques that significantly reduce or alter the bias, or unforeseen events could shift voter sentiment dramatically. In this case, I would forecast a lower probability of the polling bias falling within the specified range, perhaps around **55%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nBased on historical trends, polls have consistently underestimated Trump's support, with biases of -1.1 percentage points in 2016 and -2.7 percentage points in 2020. Pollsters have been actively working to correct these inaccuracies by adjusting their methodologies, which could reduce the bias in 2024. However, challenges like nonresponse bias\u2014where certain groups are less likely to participate in polls\u2014may persist, particularly among Trump supporters who distrust pollsters or the media.\n\nThe 2022 midterm elections showed a reduced polling error, suggesting improvements in methodology might be effective. However, presidential elections often have different dynamics than midterms, and the presence of Trump as a candidate introduces unique variables.\n\nGiven that the current timeframe is close to the election date, significant changes are less likely, solidifying the probability that the bias will fall within the historical range. If more time were available, the increased potential for change introduces greater uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 70%**", "probability": 70}
