    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Nvidia have the largest market cap in the world at the end of 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Nvidia has the largest market cup of any company according to [CompaniesMarketCap](https://companiesmarketcap.com/) after the close of trading on December 31, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- If there are ambiguities regarding Nvidia's ranking, the \"End of year Market Cap\" values will be used from each of the top companies' [individual page](https://companiesmarketcap.com/nvidia/marketcap/).\n- If CompaniesMarketCap is unavailable, admins may wait until 7 January 2025 and then use alternative, credible sources.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nNvidia has seen a meteoric rise in the past two years, with its stock growing more than threefold in 2023, a feat which is looking to repeat in 2024. Nvidia's rise can be [largely attributed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/nvidia-s-rise-to-3-trillion-fuels-jensanity-across-tech-world) to the rise of generative AI, as Nvidia [provides](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/02/nvidia-dominates-the-ai-chip-market-but-theres-rising-competition-.html) the vast majority of chips that are used to train these systems. However, in recent weeks, there have been [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/openai-google-and-anthropic-are-struggling-to-build-more-advanced-ai) that the new LLMs from the leading companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) are not showing the expected improvements.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Nvidia will have the largest market cap in the world at the end of 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Market Position\nAs of November 5, 2024, Nvidia has already surpassed Apple and Microsoft in market capitalization, with a market cap of $3.43 trillion, ahead of Apple's $3.38 trillion and Microsoft's $3.06 trillion[1].\n\n## Recent Performance\nNvidia has experienced a significant surge in its stock price, rising more than 850% since the end of 2022. This rapid growth is largely attributed to the company's dominance in the artificial intelligence sector[1].\n\n## Predictions and Forecasts\nWhile Nvidia's current position is strong, predicting its market cap at the end of 2024 involves some uncertainty. A hedge fund manager has made a prediction that Nvidia's market cap could reach $6 trillion by the end of 2024, although this is considered possible but not probable[3].\n\n## Market Volatility\nThe stock market can be highly volatile, and various factors such as economic conditions, technological advancements, and market sentiment can influence a company's market cap. Nvidia's continued dominance would depend on its ability to maintain its leadership in AI and other technological areas.\n\n## Community Predictions\nOn platforms like Metaculus, the community prediction for Nvidia having the largest market cap at the end of 2024 is around 50%, indicating some uncertainty among forecasters[2].\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the current data, Nvidia is already the largest company by market cap as of early November 2024. However, whether it will maintain this position until the end of 2024 depends on various factors, including market performance and external economic conditions. The answer is not immediately clear as a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" due to the inherent volatility of the stock market.\n\n### Relevant Information for Superforecasters\n- **Base Rates**: Nvidia's historical performance and recent surge.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The remaining period until the end of 2024.\n- **Current State of the World**: Market conditions, economic stability, and technological trends.\n- **Reference Classes**: Other companies that have experienced rapid growth and maintained market leadership.\n- **Uncertainty**: The potential for market volatility and unforeseen events that could impact Nvidia's market cap.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nvidia's market capitalization exceeded $3 trillion as of November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 2024, Nvidia's market capitalization has exceeded $3 trillion. According to the sources, Nvidia's total market value as of the close of trading in November was $3.579 trillion, making it the most valuable company on Wall Street[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major competitors such as Apple and Microsoft experiencing slower growth rates compared to Nvidia in 2024?\nANSWER: The provided source does not provide specific growth rate comparisons between Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia for the year 2024. It discusses the market capitalization and historical growth of these companies, as well as future revenue growth forecasts for Alphabet, but it does not offer a direct comparison of the growth rates of Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia for 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Nvidia currently the largest company by market capitalization as of November 2024?\nANSWER: No, as of November 2024, Nvidia is not the largest company by market capitalization. According to the sources, Apple has a market capitalization of over $3.6 trillion, surpassing Nvidia's market capitalization of around $3.474 trillion to $3.539 trillion[2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have financial analysts predominantly forecasted that Nvidia will maintain its leading market capitalization by the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, financial analysts and market projections indicate that Nvidia is expected to continue performing strongly, which would likely support its market capitalization.\n\n- Nvidia's strong financial performance, dominance in the AI and data center markets, and robust revenue growth are highlighted in the sources[2][3].\n- The company's market capitalization has been consistently high, with recent values around $3.5 trillion to $3.6 trillion as of November 2024[4].\n- While the sources do not explicitly state that Nvidia will \"maintain its leading market capitalization,\" they do suggest that the company's strong fundamentals and growth prospects will continue to support its high market valuation.\n\nGiven this context, it is reasonable to infer that analysts expect Nvidia to remain a market leader in terms of market capitalization by the end of 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been no significant economic downturns affecting the technology sector in 2024?\nANSWER: The information available suggests that while there are signs of recovery and growth in the technology sector, there have still been significant economic challenges and downturns affecting the sector in 2024.\n\n- Layoffs in major tech companies such as Microsoft, Cisco, and Intel have continued into 2024, indicating ongoing economic stress[1].\n- Despite projections of global IT spending increases, the sector is still dealing with the aftermath of a tech recession that occurred in 2023, with many developers remaining unemployed[3].\n- High interest rates, inflation, and global uncertainties have continued to impact the tech industry, although there are indications of a potential recovery and growth in areas like AI, cloud computing, and cybersecurity[2][5].\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that the technology sector has not been entirely free from significant economic downturns in 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Nvidia dominate the artificial intelligence chip market as of November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 2024, Nvidia is widely recognized as the dominant player in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market.

Here are some key points:\n\n- The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating Nvidia for potential antitrust violations, including allegations that the company is abusing its market dominance and making it difficult for customers to switch to other suppliers[2][3][4].\n- Nvidia has received civil investigative demands (CIDs) or subpoenas from the DOJ as part of this investigation, which is a significant step in the regulatory scrutiny process[1][3][4].\n- The investigation also includes scrutiny of Nvidia's acquisition of Run:ai and its pricing strategies, as well as allegations of threatening companies that buy chips from its competitors[2][3].\n\nThese developments indicate that Nvidia is facing substantial regulatory and legal challenges in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the global economy stable without any major crises impacting stock markets in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it is unclear whether the global economy is completely stable without any major crises impacting stock markets in 2024.\n\nHere are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The OECD and World Bank reports indicate that the global economy is stabilizing, with steady or slightly improving growth projections for 2024 and 2025. However, they also highlight several vulnerabilities and risks[1][4][5].\n\n- There are ongoing concerns about tight monetary conditions, high debt levels, geopolitical tensions, and the potential for a debt crisis, which could impact economic stability[1][2][4].\n\n- The World Economic Forum's Chief Economists Outlook notes that while there are reasons for cautious optimism, such as easing inflation and resilient global commerce, fiscal challenges and the risk of a debt crisis remain significant threats[2].\n\n- The reports also mention that global growth is expected to remain below its longer-run average, and various regions face different economic headwinds, including high interest rates, softening labor markets, and geopolitical tensions[1][3][4].\n\nGiven these points, while the global economy is showing signs of stabilization, it is not without significant risks and potential crises that could impact stock markets and overall economic stability. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the demand for AI-related products and services continued to grow in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the demand for AI-related products and services has continued to grow in 2024.\n\n- The Statista report indicates that the AI market is experiencing rapid growth driven by increasing adoption of digital technologies, growing awareness of AI capabilities, and the convenience of online services. The market is expected to reach $184 billion in 2024 and continues to grow due to advancements in various AI technologies[1].\n- The IDC report highlights that the worldwide revenue for AI platforms software grew significantly in 2023 and is projected to continue growing, reaching $153 billion by 2028 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 40.6% over the 2023-2028 period[2].\n- The Bain & Company report states that the market for AI-related hardware and software is expected to grow between 40% and 55% annually, reaching between $780 billion and $990 billion by 2027, indicating strong and ongoing growth in 2024 and beyond[3].\n- The McKinsey Global Survey on AI for 2024 shows a significant increase in AI adoption, with 72% of respondents reporting that their organizations are using AI, and 65% of respondents saying their organizations are regularly using generative AI, which is nearly double the percentage from the previous survey[4].\n\nThese sources collectively indicate a continued and robust growth in demand for AI-related products and services in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been no major mergers or acquisitions among other top companies that significantly alter their market caps in 2024?\nANSWER: No, there have been several major mergers and acquisitions among top companies in 2024 that significantly alter their market caps.

    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately **39 days** remain until December 31, 2024, from today's date of November 22, 2024.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current market conditions and Nvidia's position remain stable, **Nvidia would retain its status as the largest company by market capitalization**, maintaining its lead over Apple and Microsoft with a market cap of approximately $3.43 trillion.\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith about **10 days** remaining, the likelihood of significant market shifts is reduced. In this scenario, the probability of Nvidia maintaining the largest market cap would increase to approximately **75%**.\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith around **5 months** remaining, there is more time for market volatility, economic changes, and potential regulatory impacts to influence company rankings. In this extended timeframe, the probability of Nvidia maintaining its position would decrease to approximately **60%**.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nNvidia currently holds a slight lead in market capitalization over major competitors like Apple and Microsoft. Its dominance in the AI chip market and strong stock performance bolster its position. However, ongoing regulatory investigations and broader economic uncertainties introduce potential risks. The relatively short timeframe until the end of the year limits the window for significant changes, favoring Nvidia's current standing. Balancing these factors suggests a moderate to high likelihood that Nvidia will maintain its leading market cap position by December 31, 2024.\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
