    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Rivian make any posts at its Stories site before Jan 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a new post appears at Rivian's Stories page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://stories.rivian.com/), timestamped after the close of this question and before Januar 1, 2025. If there is no such post, this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other web address than the one mentioned will count. If the web page is down when a Metaculus Admin attempts to access it, this question resolves as No--forecasters are therefore encouraged if they think there is a material chance of the page being down to incorporate that into their forecast.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of November 20, 2024, Rivian's most recent post was timestamped November 14, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Rivian will make any posts on its Stories site before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Activity and Engagement\nRivian has been actively engaging with its community through various channels, including the Rivian Stories site, which is a platform for owners and preorder holders to share their experiences. Given the ongoing activities such as the R2 and R3X road tour, updates on production timelines, and other company news, it is likely that Rivian will continue to communicate with its community[2].\n\n## Recent and Upcoming Events\nRivian has several upcoming events, including the R2 Road Tour across North America, which will continue into 2025. These events often generate content and updates that could be posted on the Rivian Stories site[2].\n\n## Production and Delivery Timelines\nThere is significant interest and anticipation around the production and delivery of the R2, with first deliveries expected by late 2025. Updates on this process would likely be shared with the community, potentially through the Rivian Stories site[1][2].\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to expect that Rivian will continue to post updates and engage with its community on the Rivian Stories site before January 1, 2025, especially considering the ongoing and upcoming activities related to new vehicle models and production.\n\nHowever, without direct confirmation from Rivian, it is not possible to provide a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" answer. The likelihood, though, based on current activities and engagement patterns, suggests that posts will indeed be made.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Rivian posted any updates to its Stories site within the past two weeks?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, the most recent update mentioned on Rivian's Stories site is from June 6, 2024, which is within the past two weeks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Rivian experiencing any operational disruptions that could impact their online communication channels?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of operational disruptions that could impact Rivian's online communication channels. The sources discuss production cuts, supply chain issues, financial challenges, and other operational problems, but they do not address any issues related to online communication channels.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any known technical issues currently affecting Rivian's Stories site?\nANSWER: There is no mention of technical issues specifically affecting Rivian's website or a \"Stories site\" in the provided sources. The sources discuss various issues related to Rivian's vehicles, production, and supply chain problems, but they do not address any technical issues with the company's website or a specific section like a \"Stories site.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Rivian actively participating in the R2 or R3X road tours as of November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 2024, Rivian is actively participating in the R2 and R3X road tours. The company has announced and is conducting various events and displays at multiple locations, including Laguna Beach, Venice, the Los Angeles Auto Show, and other cities, where the public can meet and view the R2 and R3X vehicles[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Rivian's Stories site appear to be currently operational?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the Rivian Stories site appears to be operational but with some limitations or requirements. For instance, the site requires users to enable cookies and confirm they are human beings to access certain pages[4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Rivian made any public statements about future content planned for the Stories site?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of Rivian making public statements about future content planned specifically for the Stories site. The sources discuss various current and upcoming initiatives, such as the R2 and R3 product lines, software updates, and other projects, but they do not address future content plans for the Stories site.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Rivian announced any upcoming events scheduled before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, Rivian has announced several upcoming events scheduled before January 1, 2025.\n\n- The R2 Road Tour includes stops in various cities such as Laguna Beach (November 15-17), Venice (November 20), and the Los Angeles Auto Show (November 22-December 1)[1][2][5].\n- Additional stops include Austin (November 7-11), and other cities in the U.S. and Canada, with the tour continuing into December 2024[2][3].\n\nThese events are all scheduled to take place before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Rivian increased its community engagement efforts in the last few months?\nANSWER: Yes, Rivian has increased its community engagement efforts in the last few months. Here are some indicators of this:\n\n- The Rivian Clubs of America (RCA) has launched an expanded membership program with new tiers and exclusive perks, which includes partnerships and community engagement activities. This was announced in May 2024[3].\n- Rivian continues to cultivate an active community of enthusiasts through events, social media, and early customer engagement programs, which is an ongoing effort but has been highlighted recently[2].\n- The company has also been involved in various community and environmental initiatives, such as the Rivian Foundation supporting organizations that drive critical work for the planet and communities, which was announced in September 2024[4].\n\nThese activities demonstrate an increased focus on community engagement and participation.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Rivian's production timeline for the R2 progressing as planned?\nANSWER: Based on the available information, the production timeline for Rivian's R2 model appears to be generally on track, but there are some nuances and adjustments.\n\n- The initial plan was for the R2 production to start in 2026, which is still the case. The production is scheduled to begin in the first half of 2026, with deliveries also expected in 2026[1][2][5].\n- There were indications that Rivian might start initial production at their Normal, Illinois facility before moving to the new plant in Georgia, which aligns with current plans[2][5].\n- Despite some discussions about the possibility of earlier production in Normal, there is no confirmed change to the overall 2026 production and delivery timeline[4].\n\nTherefore, the production timeline for the R2 is progressing as planned, with no significant deviations from the originally announced schedule.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any scheduled product releases or updates from Rivian before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several scheduled product releases and updates from Rivian before January 1, 2025.\n\n- The 2025 Rivian R1S and R1T models, including the new Tri Motor and Quad Motor variants, are part of the refresh for 2025. The Tri Motor variants are expected to be available this summer, with the Quad Motor models arriving sometime after that, but still within 2024[2].\n- There are also various updates and features scheduled for release in the latter part of 2024, such as the holiday software update in December 2024, which will include features like Netflix and YouTube[3].\n- Additionally, NACS adapters are expected to begin shipping in September 2024, and other updates like new front fascia, better interior materials, and more efficient Enduros motors are anticipated around August 2024[3].\n\nThese indicate that Rivian has several product releases and updates planned before January 1, 2025.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \n40 days (from November 21, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changes:**  \n**Yes**, Rivian will make at least one post on its Stories site before January 1, 2025.\n\n(c) **Forecast with only a quarter of the time left (approximately 10 days):**  \nProbability: **85%**\n\n(d) **Forecast with four times the time left (approximately 160 days):**  \nProbability: **90%**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nGiven that there are 40 days remaining until the resolution date, Rivian has ample time to make additional posts on its Stories site. The company's recent activity, including a post just a week ago (November 14, 2024), indicates ongoing engagement with its community. Rivian is actively participating in the R2 and R3X road tours, which are likely to generate content for the Stories site. Additionally, several scheduled events and product releases before January 1, 2025, suggest that Rivian will continue to communicate updates and engage with its audience.\n\nThere are no confirmed operational or technical issues affecting the Stories site, although some uncertainties remain. However, given Rivian's heightened community engagement efforts and active participation in events, the likelihood of posting remains high. Even if only a quarter of the time were left, the strong current engagement patterns support a high probability of at least one post. Extending the timeframe to four times the remaining period does not significantly alter this assessment, as Rivian's engagement strategies appear consistent.\n\nConsidering all factors, including recent activity, upcoming events, and sustained community engagement, it is highly probable that Rivian will make a post on its Stories site before the specified date.\n\n**Probability: 90%**",
