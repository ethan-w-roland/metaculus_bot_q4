    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Google have over a 90% global search engine market share, according to StatCounter, on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-14\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if [StatCounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share) lists Google has having ≥90.00% search engine market share worldwide when accessed by Metaculus on or after December 31, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIn case of the resolution source being down, Metaculus Admins will wait until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFor further context particularly about Google's competition against Bing and its effect on market share please see [Bing vs Google: Search Engine Comparison 2024](https://www.impressiondigital.com/blog/bing-differ-google/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Google will have over a 90% global search engine market share on December 31, 2024, according to StatCounter, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Market Share\nAs of recent updates, Google's global search engine market share has been consistently above 90%. For example, as of August 2024, Google's market share was 90.48%[5], and in February 2024, it was 91.62%[4].\n\n## Historical Stability\nGoogle's market share has been remarkably stable and dominant over the past decade. It has not dipped below 90% since 2014, with only a brief exception in that year[5].\n\n## Recent Trends\nWhile there have been minor fluctuations, Google's market share has generally remained above 90%. For instance, between February 2023 and February 2024, Google's global market share dropped slightly from 93.37% to 91.62%, but it still maintained a significant lead[4].\n\n## Suspect Data Points\nThere was a report of a significant drop in Google's market share in April 2024, but this data was later questioned and is expected to be revised. Such anomalies are unlikely to reflect real user behavior and are often corrected upon further review[2].\n\n## Device-Specific Dominance\nGoogle dominates across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, which further solidifies its overall market share[1][5].\n\nGiven these points, it is highly likely that Google will maintain a global search engine market share above 90% on December 31, 2024, according to StatCounter. However, the exact percentage could vary slightly due to minor fluctuations, but the overall trend suggests continued dominance by Google.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Google have long-term agreements securing its position as the default search engine on major web browsers and devices?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nGoogle has long-term agreements that secure its position as the default search engine on major web browsers and devices. These agreements include deals with device manufacturers, web browsers, and mobile ecosystem rivals such as Apple, as well as contracts with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of Android devices and cell phone carriers. These arrangements ensure Google is the default search engine on devices and browsers, including Android and Apple phones, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Google's reputation suffered recent significant damage that could lead to a decrease in its search engine user base?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no direct evidence to suggest that Google's reputation has suffered significant damage that could lead to a decrease in its search engine user base due to the recent updates.\n\nThe sources discuss the March 2024 Google Core and Spam updates, which are aimed at improving the quality of search results by targeting spammy content, scaled content abuse, expired domain abuse, and site reputation abuse. While these updates have caused concerns and impacts on some websites, particularly those engaging in spammy practices, there is no indication that these changes have negatively affected Google's overall reputation or user base[2][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Google's global search engine market share currently over 90%, according to StatCounter?\nANSWER: No, Google's global search engine market share is not currently over 90% according to the latest data from StatCounter.\n\nAs of April 2024, Google's global search engine market share dropped to 86.99% from 91.38% in March[2].\n\nAdditionally, as of February 2024, Google's global market share was reported to be 91.62%, but this had already shown a decline from the previous year[4]. However, the more recent data from April 2024 confirms that the share has fallen below 90%.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Google's global search engine market share remained above 90% consistently over the past five years, according to StatCounter?\nANSWER: No, Google's global search engine market share has not remained above 90% consistently over the past five years, according to the data from StatCounter.\n\nWhile Google has dominated the search engine market with a share often above 90%, there have been periods where its share dipped slightly below this threshold. For example, between February 2023 and February 2024, Google's global market share dropped from 93.37% to 91.62%[1][4].\n\nAdditionally, as of August 2024, Google's market share was at 90.48%, which is just below the 90% mark[4]. Therefore, it has not consistently remained above 90% over the past five years.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a notable trend of users switching to alternative search engines that prioritize privacy, such as DuckDuckGo?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a notable trend of users switching to alternative search engines that prioritize privacy, such as DuckDuckGo.\n\nSeveral sources indicate an increasing interest and adoption of privacy-focused search engines. Here are some key points:\n\n- DuckDuckGo has seen significant growth, handling over 100 million daily search queries in 2021 and continuing to be a preferred option for privacy enthusiasts[3][5].\n- Startpage, another privacy-focused search engine, has surpassed 3 million daily searches as of 2023, reflecting increased public awareness and concern over privacy issues[5].\n- The rise in usage of these search engines is attributed to users seeking to protect their data and avoid the tracking and data collection practices of major search engines like Google[2][3][5].\n\nThese indicators suggest a growing trend towards the use of alternative, privacy-centric search engines.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are AI technologies like ChatGPT increasingly being used as alternatives to traditional search engines like Google?\nANSWER: Yes, AI technologies like ChatGPT are increasingly being used as alternatives to traditional search engines like Google.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the integration of AI into search engines, offering alternative search experiences that differ from the traditional keyword-matching approach of engines like Google.\n\n- Perplexity.ai, for example, uses AI to provide direct, contextually rich answers and allows users to ask follow-up questions, mimicking a conversational style[1][3][4].\n- ChatGPT Search, developed by OpenAI, leverages live web data and AI to deliver relevant answers, including real-time information and clear citations[3][4].\n- Microsoft’s Bing, integrated with ChatGPT, offers a chat-based interface that provides comprehensive and context-aware responses[2][4][5].\n\nThese AI-powered search engines are designed to enhance the search experience by providing more precise, interactive, and intuitive results, making them viable alternatives to traditional search engines.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any ongoing regulatory or antitrust action that could significantly impact Google's search engine market share by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are ongoing regulatory and antitrust actions that could significantly impact Google's search engine market share by December 31, 2024.\n\n1. **Search Monopoly Case**: In August 2024, Federal Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google is an illegal monopolist in the markets for general search services and general search text ads. This ruling is subject to appeal, but if upheld, it could lead to significant changes, such as divestiture of certain Google assets or the end of Google's exclusive agreements with device manufacturers, which could impact its market share[1][3][4].\n\n2. **Ad Tech Antitrust Trial**: A trial is ongoing in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, where the DOJ and several state attorneys general are alleging that Google has established a monopoly in the advertising software sector. Judge Leonie Brinkema is expected to issue a ruling by the end of 2024, which could have profound implications for Google's dominance in the ad tech market and, by extension, its search engine market share[2][5].\n\nThese ongoing cases and potential rulings could lead to significant regulatory actions that might alter Google's market position by the end of 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major competitors significantly increased their global search engine market share in recent years, according to StatCounter?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, there have been some changes in the global search engine market share, but the significance of these changes can be nuanced.\n\n- From February 2023 to February 2024, Google's global market share dropped from 93.37% to 91.62%, which is a decline of about 1.75 percentage points. During this period, Bing increased its market share from 2.81% to 3.31%, YANDEX from 0.84% to 1.84%, and Baidu from 0.45% to 0.77%. These increases, while notable, are still relatively small compared to Google's dominant share[2].\n\n- There was a reported significant but temporary and likely erroneous drop in Google's market share in April 2024, with Bing and Yahoo showing large gains. However, this data was later questioned and marked for review by StatCounter, indicating it may not be accurate[3].\n\nIn summary, while there have been small increases in market share for competitors like Bing, YANDEX, and Baidu, these changes are not drastic and do not significantly alter the dominant position of Google in the global search engine market.\n\n**YES**, but the increases are relatively small and do not significantly challenge Google's dominance.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Google faced any significant bans or restrictions in major markets that could affect its global search engine market share?\nANSWER: Yes, Google has faced significant bans or restrictions in major markets that could affect its global search engine market share.\n\n1. **EU-Based News Content Test**: Google is conducting a test in several EU countries where around 1% of users will not see EU-based news publishers in Google News, Search, and Discover. However, this test was blocked in France by a court order, which could set a precedent for other regions[1].\n\n2. **French Court Order**: A Paris court ordered the suspension of the test in France, with potential fines of up to €900,000 per day if Google does not comply. This indicates significant regulatory pushback in a major EU market[1].\n\n3. **Canadian Online News Act Exemption**: While Google was granted an exemption from the Online News Act in Canada, this exemption comes with specific conditions and requirements, such as annual contributions to Canadian news businesses and transparency reports. This could influence how Google operates in Canada and potentially set a model for other countries[5].\n\n4. **US Antitrust Considerations**: The US Justice Department is considering breaking up Google due to antitrust concerns, which would be a drastic measure with significant implications for Google's global operations[2].\n\nThese developments indicate that Google is facing various regulatory challenges and restrictions in major markets, which could impact its global search engine market share.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any competitor announced a technological innovation that could substantially challenge Google's dominance in search engines?\nANSWER: Several competitors have announced technological innovations that could potentially challenge Google's dominance in the search engine market, although it is unclear if these will be substantial enough to significantly erode Google's market share.\n\n## AI-Powered Search Engines\n- Microsoft's Bing has integrated Microsoft Copilot, which uses advanced AI to enhance the search experience, providing detailed responses and a chat-based interface. This has helped Bing grow its market share and user engagement[1][4][5].\n\n## Privacy-Focused Search Engines\n- Search engines like DuckDuckGo, Startpage, and Brave Search are gaining traction by focusing on user privacy, which could attract users disillusioned with Google's handling of user data[1][2][4].\n\n## Regional Search Engines\n- Yandex in Russia and Baidu in China are leveraging AI technologies to improve their search capabilities. For example, Baidu's ERNIE (Enhanced Representation through kNowledge Integration) uses knowledge graphs to enhance natural language understanding and generation, and around 11% of Baidu's traditional core search results are now generated using AI technology[4][5].\n\n## Innovative AI Search Engines\n- New AI-powered search engines like Perplexity, Bagoodex, and Arc Search are offering interactive, chat-style interfaces and precise, concise responses, which could attract users looking for alternative search experiences[1][4].\n\nWhile these innovations are significant and indicate a competitive landscape, it remains to be seen whether they will collectively or individually be enough to substantially challenge Google's current dominance.",
