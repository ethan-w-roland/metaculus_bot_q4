{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill a book written by a language model make the NY Times Best Seller list before 2025?\n\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nA book is said to have been written by a language model if a language model wrote at least 99% of the text contained in the main section in the book, excluding a potential foreword, copyright notice, table of contents, and other non-essential book sections. The main text must also contain at least 20,000 words. Stylistic edits by humans are allowed if they do not change the basic semantic meaning of any sentence, or they merely correct basic spelling, grammatical, or formatting mistakes. Admins will use their discretion, in consultation with the community, to determine whether any candidate book meets the spirit of these conditions.\n\nThis question resolves positively if the above conditions are met before 2025, and negatively otherwise.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFrom [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model),\n\n> A statistical language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words.\n\nThe New York Times Best Seller list [is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times_Best_Seller_list),\n\n> widely considered the preeminent list of best-selling books in the United States. It has been published weekly in The New York Times Book Review since October 12, 1931. In the 21st century, it has evolved into multiple lists, grouped by genre and format, including fiction and non-fiction, hardcover, paperback and electronic.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of a book written by a language model making the New York Times Best Seller list before 2025, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Current State of AI-Generated Content\nAs of now, while AI-generated content, including books, is becoming more sophisticated, it has not yet achieved widespread mainstream acceptance or commercial success in the literary world. However, the technology is rapidly evolving, and it is possible that AI-generated books could gain more traction in the near future.\n\n## New York Times Best Seller List Mechanics\nThe New York Times Best Seller list is not a purely quantitative measure of book sales but is also curated by the editors. The list reflects sales at a select number of bookstores and online retailers, and the editors have some discretion in what books they include.\n\n## Author and Market Recognition\nTraditionally, books that make the New York Times Best Seller list are often written by established authors or those with significant marketing and publishing support. While AI-generated content can be of high quality, it may lack the authorial recognition and marketing push that typically accompanies books by well-known authors.\n\n## Public and Critical Reception\nFor a book to make the New York Times Best Seller list, it generally needs to receive significant public and critical acclaim. As AI-generated books are still relatively new and not widely accepted as equal to human-authored works, they might face additional hurdles in gaining the necessary recognition.\n\n## Time to Resolution\nGiven that the question pertains to the period before 2025, there is still time for significant developments in AI technology and public acceptance. However, as of the current date (October 21, 2024), there is no clear evidence that an AI-generated book has achieved the level of success required to be listed on the New York Times Best Seller list.\n\n## Reference Classes\nThere are no known instances of AI-generated books making the New York Times Best Seller list to serve as a reference class. This lack of precedent makes it difficult to predict with certainty whether such an event will occur before 2025.\n\nIn summary, while it is possible that advancements in AI technology and changes in public perception could lead to an AI-generated book making the New York Times Best Seller list, there is currently no clear indication that this will happen before 2025. The answer to this question is not immediately clear and would require further developments in the field.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any AI-generated books been reviewed by major

The list is curated, and sales from specific sources are required.\n- While language models can generate coherent and sometimes convincing texts, there is no evidence to suggest that they have produced a book that has achieved the necessary sales and editorial approval to be included on the New York Times Best Seller list.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there authors or influencers actively promoting AI-generated books to a wide audience before 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, there are indications that authors or influencers, as well as other entities, are actively promoting or involved with AI-generated books before 2025.\n\n- The article from PublishingState.com mentions that by 2025, AI will be heavily integrated into book marketing, but it also implies that this trend is already underway. For instance, AI chatbots are interacting with potential readers, and AI-generated ad campaigns are being used.\n\n- The New Book Recommendation article highlights that as of 2024, a significant portion of publishers are using AI for various tasks, including marketing strategies. This suggests that AI-generated content and its promotion are already active in the industry.\n\n- The European Writers Council analysis mentions that fake authors and AI-generated books are being promoted on platforms like Amazon and Goodreads, even to the point of manipulating bestseller lists. This indicates that AI-generated books are being actively pushed to a wide audience, albeit often through deceptive means.\n\nThese sources collectively indicate that AI-generated books are indeed being promoted to a wide audience before 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a growing trend of public acceptance and interest in AI-generated books as of 2024?\nANSWER: The trend of public acceptance and interest in AI-generated books as of 2024 is complex and not uniformly positive.\n\n- While there are some indications that AI is becoming more integrated into the publishing industry, with some authors and companies exploring its potential benefits, there is also significant concern and resistance from many in the writing community.\n- Many authors are alarmed by the unauthorized use of their work to train AI models and the subsequent production of AI-generated books that mimic their style, which they see as a threat to their livelihoods and intellectual property.\n- The Authors Guild and other advocacy groups are actively working to regulate AI use and protect authors' rights, indicating that the acceptance of AI-generated books is not widespread among authors.\n- Public acceptance is also mixed, with some readers potentially interested in AI-generated content but others likely to be skeptical or opposed to it, especially if it is seen as competing with or replacing human authors.\n\nGiven these points, it is unclear whether there is a growing trend of public acceptance and interest in AI-generated books, as the response is highly divided.\n\n**UNCLEAR**", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately 2 months (from October 21, 2024, to the end of 2024).\n\n**(b) Outcome if nothing changes:**\nIf the current trends and conditions remain the same, no AI-generated book would make the New York Times Best Seller list before 2025.\n\n**(c) Forecast with only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith about 2 weeks remaining, the likelihood remains extremely low. Achieving bestseller status typically requires sustained sales and visibility, which is unlikely to be achieved in such a short timeframe without significant changes.\n\n**(d) Forecast with 4x the time left:**\nExtending the timeframe to approximately 8 months could allow for increased marketing efforts and greater public acceptance of AI-generated content. However, even with this extended period, the probability remains low due to factors like editorial selection and author recognition.\n\n**Rationale:**\nAs of October 2024, AI-generated books have not yet achieved mainstream recognition or significant marketing support necessary to break into the New York Times Best Seller list. The criteria for the list involve not only high sales but also editorial discretion, which tends to favor established authors and well-promoted titles. While AI technology is advancing and public interest in AI-generated content is growing, there are still substantial barriers to an AI-authored book achieving bestseller status within a short timeframe. Extending the time frame may slightly increase the chances, but given the current landscape and the time required to build the necessary momentum, the likelihood remains low.\n\n**Probability: 5%**", "probability": 5}
