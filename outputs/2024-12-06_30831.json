    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Tesla's stock price be under $420 a share on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **No** if according to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history/) the listed \"Close\" price for Tesla, Inc., is greater than or equal to $420.00 for December 31, 2024. If it is under that price, this question resolves as **Yes**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. Forward or reverse stock splits will be immaterial for this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of the close of trading on November 20, 2024, Tesla traded at $342.03\r\n per share. At the time of this question, Tesla has experienced a post-election rally as its CEO, Elon Musk, is reported to be working in an advisory role for President-Elect Donald Trump.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Tesla's stock price will be under $420 a share on December 31, 2024, here are some key points and forecasts from various sources:\n\n## Current Price and Recent Trends\nAs of recent reports, Tesla's stock price has been volatile but has shown significant recovery. For example, as of November 8, 2024, the stock was trading at $321.22, and more recently, it was around $220.68 to $371.84 per share[2][5].\n\n## Analyst Predictions for 2024\n- The end-of-year 2024 target prices range widely among analysts. Some predictions include:\n  - A range between $170 and $233 according to some sources[1].\n  - A target of $254.12 by TradersUnion[2].\n  - A prediction of $352.36 to $444.83 by CoinCodex[5].\n  - Some analysts predict the stock could reach as high as $409.46 or even $838.52, although these are more bullish outliers[1][2].\n\n## Specific Forecasts Around $420\n- There are no specific forecasts that precisely predict the stock will be under $420 on December 31, 2024, but several forecasts suggest prices that could be below or above this mark.\n  - CoinCodex predicts a trading channel between $352.36 and $444.83, which includes the possibility of being under $420[5].\n  - Other forecasts, while not pinpointing December 31, suggest a range that could include prices above or below $420[1][2].\n\n## Volatility and Uncertainty\n- Tesla's stock has been highly volatile, influenced by factors such as production challenges, market competition, economic uncertainty, and significant events like the US presidential election and Elon Musk's relationship with the new administration[1][3][4].\n\nGiven the wide range of predictions and the inherent volatility of Tesla's stock, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the stock price will be under $420 on December 31, 2024. The forecasts indicate a possibility of the stock price being both above and below this mark, depending on various factors and analyst opinions.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Elon Musk actively involved in Tesla’s management in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Elon Musk is actively involved in Tesla’s management in 2024. He has been serving as the Chief Executive Officer of Tesla since October 2008 and is also a member of the Board since April 2004[2]. There is no indication in the provided sources that he has stepped down from these roles.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the US GDP grow by more than 3% in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the US GDP growth for the third quarter of 2024 was below 3%.\n\n- The GDP in the United States expanded 2.7% or 2.8% year-on-year in the third quarter of 2024, depending on the source[1][2][3].\n- There is no indication that the GDP growth for the entire year 2024 exceeded 3%, especially given the quarterly growth rates provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Tesla’s stock price close above $400 on December 31, 2023?\nANSWER: No, Tesla’s stock price did not close above $400 on December 31, 2023. The sources provided do not have the exact closing price for December 31, 2023, but they do indicate that the closing price on December 29, 2023, was $248.48, which is significantly below $400[1][3][4]. There is no data suggesting the stock price surged to above $400 in the last two days of the year.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the global electric vehicle market grown by at least 10% in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe global electric vehicle market has seen significant growth in 2024. According to the Global EV Outlook 2024, electric car sales in the first quarter of 2024 grew by around 25% compared to the first quarter of 2023, and it is estimated that global electric car sales could reach around 17 million in 2024, which is more than a 20% increase over the 14 million sold in 2023[1][3][4]. This indicates that the global electric vehicle market has grown by at least 10% in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the overall U.S. stock market index increase by more than 15% in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the overall U.S. stock market indices increased by more than 15% in 2024.\n\n- The S&P 500 index had a year-to-date (YTD) return of 26.47% as of November 2024[1].\n- The S&P 500 index closed the year at 6,086.49, representing a 27.60% annual increase for 2024[2].\n\nThese figures indicate that the S&P 500, a key benchmark for the U.S. stock market, exceeded a 15% increase for the year 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Tesla been subject to any major regulatory actions in 2024?\nANSWER: YES, Tesla has been subject to major regulatory actions in 2024.\n\n- On April 26, 2024, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced it is investigating whether the December 2023 recall of Tesla’s Autopilot driving system was sufficient to ensure drivers pay attention to the road. This investigation follows reports of 20 more crashes involving Autopilot since the recall[4].\n- Additionally, Tesla's autonomous driving technology, including the robotaxi, is facing various regulatory hurdles, such as the need to acquire permits to test and operate autonomous vehicles without a driver, and potential federal approval for mass-producing vehicles without steering wheels or pedals[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did any major competitor of Tesla launch a new electric vehicle in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, several major competitors of Tesla launched or are set to launch new electric vehicles in 2024.\n\n- Cadillac is introducing the Optiq, a compact SUV with a dual-motor all-wheel-drive powertrain, expected to go on sale in late 2024[1][4].\n- Audi will launch the Q6 e-tron, which slots between the Q4 and Q8 e-tron crossovers, also expected in late 2024[4].\n- Volvo's EX90, a three-row, seven-seat, full-size SUV, is on sale in early 2024[3].\n- VinFast's VF 8 and VF 9 SUVs are already on sale, although they were first shown in 2022, they continue to be relevant in 2024[1].\n\nThese launches indicate that major competitors of Tesla are indeed introducing new electric vehicles in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Tesla introduced any major new models or products in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Tesla has not introduced any major new models as of 2024, but there have been some significant updates and announcements.\n\n- The 2024 Tesla Model 3 has undergone a styling refresh, including changes to the front and rear designs, new taillights, ventilated seats, and other interior updates. However, this is an update to an existing model rather than a completely new model[1][3].\n- There have been announcements and teasers about upcoming models, such as the Cybercab (or robotaxi), which is expected to be revealed later in 2024, but it has not been introduced yet[4][5].\n- Other upcoming models like the Roadster 2.0, the Compact EV (or Model 2), and potential new vehicles like a van have been mentioned, but they are not yet available in 2024[3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO** (for major new models introduced in 2024, though there have been updates to existing models and announcements about future models).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Tesla report higher-than-expected vehicle deliveries in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- For Q3 2024, Tesla delivered 462,890 vehicles, which is slightly above the predicted 460,000 units by RBC analyst Tom Narayan, but fell just shy of the approximately 463,900 units expected by Wall Street analysts[1].\n- This indicates that while Tesla's deliveries were higher than some expectations, they did not exceed all expectations.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Tesla reported higher-than-expected vehicle deliveries in 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\nThis is because the deliveries were higher than some predictions but not all.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Tesla experience any substantial recalls or safety issues in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Tesla experienced several substantial recalls and safety issues in 2024.\n\n- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature after reports of crashes, including a pedestrian fatality, due to the system's failure to react appropriately to reduced roadway visibility conditions[1].\n- Tesla issued a recall for over 2,400 Cybertrucks due to a potentially faulty drive inverter that could cause a sudden loss of propulsion[2].\n- There were recalls related to various other issues, such as a hood latch assembly failure that could cause the hood to open and obstruct the driver's view, and an incorrect font size on the instrument panel for critical safety warning lights[3].\n- In December 2023, but affecting vehicles into 2024, Tesla recalled vehicles equipped with Autosteer due to concerns that the feature did not ensure drivers paid attention to the road and their surroundings, and subsequent investigations and crashes raised further concerns about the Autopilot system[5].\n- Additionally, there were other recalls and safety updates, including issues with the seat recliner mechanism in 2024 Model Y vehicles and ongoing investigations into the effectiveness of Tesla's Autopilot system updates[3][5].",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \n25 days (from December 6, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions remain stable, Tesla's stock, which closed at $342.03 on November 20, 2024, would likely stay below $420 by December 31, 2024. Therefore, the outcome would be **Yes** (the stock price will be under $420).\n\n(c) **Forecast with only a quarter of the time left (approximately 6 days):**  \nWith only 6 days remaining, there's limited time for significant price movements. The stock would likely continue its current trend barring any unexpected news or events. The probability remains high that the stock stays under $420, but short-term volatility could introduce slight uncertainty.\n\n(d) **Forecast with 4x the time left (100 days):**  \nIf there were 100 days until the outcome, there would be ample time for market dynamics, news, and other factors to influence Tesla's stock price. This extended timeframe would introduce greater uncertainty, allowing for both upward and downward movements beyond the current projections. However, since the actual timeframe is only 25 days, this scenario is less relevant to the current prediction.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nGiven Tesla's current stock price of $342.03 and the wide range of analyst forecasts, there's a substantial probability that the stock will remain below $420 by the end of December 2024. While there are bullish forecasts and positive market indicators, the limited time remaining reduces the likelihood of a significant rally pushing the stock above $420. Additionally, factors such as regulatory actions, competition, and economic conditions may exert downward or stabilizing pressure on the stock price.\n\n**Probability: 75%**",
