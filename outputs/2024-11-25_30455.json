    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Brazil ban the 6x1 work schedule before 1 January 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Brazil banning the 6x1 work schedule before 1 January 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Status of the Proposal\nThe proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule is currently in the form of a Proposed Constitutional Amendment (PEC) led by Deputy Erika Hilton and supported by the Life Beyond Work (VAT) movement. As of November 2024, the proposal has garnered support from over 70 parliamentarians but still needs 171 signatures from deputies or 22 senators to be officially processed[1][2][5].\n\n## Political and Social Support\nThe proposal has significant support from social media, influencers, and various political parties, including the left and some centrist parties. However, it faces resistance from conservative and far-right parties, which could hinder its progress[5].\n\n## Legislative Process\nFor the PEC to be approved, it must go through several legislative steps, including public debates, committee approvals, and votes in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Given the current pace and the need for additional signatures, it is uncertain whether this process can be completed before 1 January 2025[1][2][5].\n\n## Public and Labor Support\nThe proposal has strong public support, with over 1.3 million signatures on an online petition. Labor unions and many workers are also advocating for the change, citing the negative impacts of the 6x1 schedule on health, well-being, and family relationships[1][2][5].\n\n## Challenges and Resistance\nThe proposal faces challenges from sectors that rely heavily on the 6x1 schedule, such as industries, markets, restaurants, and essential services. These sectors argue that ending the 6x1 scale could increase costs and require additional hiring to maintain continuous operations[1][2].\n\nGiven these factors, while there is significant momentum and support for the proposal, the timeline for approval is tight. The need for additional signatures, the resistance from certain sectors, and the complexity of the legislative process make it uncertain whether the ban can be implemented before 1 January 2025.\n\n### Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- The proposal is still in the early stages of the legislative process.\n- Significant political and social support exists, but so does substantial resistance.\n- The legislative process in Brazil can be slow and complex.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Previous labor reforms in Brazil have taken considerable time to implement.\n- The current political climate and the balance of power in Congress will play a crucial role in the proposal's success.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The global trend towards better work-life balance and labor rights could influence public and political opinion in Brazil.\n- Economic and operational challenges faced by industries reliant on the 6x1 schedule will be a significant factor in the decision-making process.\n\nIn summary, while the proposal has gained significant traction, the likelihood of it being approved and implemented before 1 January 2025 is uncertain due to the ongoing legislative process and the various challenges it faces.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the online petition supporting the ban on the 6x1 work schedule collected over 1.3 million signatures?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe online petition in support of the ban on the 6x1 work schedule has collected more than 1.3 million signatures. As of the latest updates, it has even surpassed this number, with reports of 1.5 million[3] and 2.9 million signatures[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Proposed Constitutional Amendment to ban the 6x1 work schedule received at least 171 signatures from deputies in the Chamber of Deputies?\nANSWER: YES, the Proposed Constitutional Amendment (PEC) to ban the 6x1 work schedule has received at least 171 signatures from deputies in the Chamber of Deputies. According to the sources, the proposal led by Congresswoman Erika Hilton has gathered more than the minimum required signatures, with reports indicating it has reached 216 or 227 signatures[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Proposed Constitutional Amendment to ban the 6x1 work schedule reached the Brazilian Senate?\nANSWER: The Proposed Constitutional Amendment (PEC) to ban the 6x1 work schedule has not yet reached the Brazilian Senate. According to the sources, the PEC is currently in the process of being discussed and processed in the National Congress, specifically in the Federal Chamber (the lower house of the Brazilian Congress), where it needs to gather 171 signatures to proceed. It has not been mentioned that the proposal has advanced to the Senate[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Proposed Constitutional Amendment to ban the 6x1 work schedule been approved by the Chamber of Deputies?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe Proposed Constitutional Amendment (PEC) to ban the 6x1 work schedule, led by Congresswoman Erika Hilton, has not been approved by the Chamber of Deputies. It has gathered the necessary signatures to be processed but is still in the early stages of the legislative process and has not yet been voted on by the Chamber of Deputies[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major industries reliant on the 6x1 work schedule issued formal statements against the Proposed Constitutional Amendment?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it is unclear whether major industries reliant on the 6x1 work schedule have issued formal statements against the Proposed Constitutional Amendment.\n\nWhile the sources discuss the proposal to end the 6x1 work schedule and its potential impacts on various industries, they do not specifically mention formal statements from these industries against the amendment. For example, sources [3] and [4] mention resistance and concerns from productive sectors, but they do not provide details on formal statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have conservative or far-right political parties in Brazil officially opposed the Proposed Constitutional Amendment to ban the 6x1 work schedule?\nANSWER: Yes, conservative and far-right political parties in Brazil have officially opposed the Proposed Constitutional Amendment to ban the 6x1 work schedule.\n\n- The far-right party of former president Jair Bolsonaro has been among those refusing to debate the issue and put it on the agenda, with only one deputy from the party signing the proposal[5].\n- Conservative and far-right parties have shown significant resistance to the proposal, with some parties voting to remove the proposal from discussion in the legislative process[3][5].\n- Specifically, parties such as the Liberal Party (PL), Progressive Party (PP), Brazil Union, and the Republicans have voted against discussing the proposal[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have labor unions in Brazil publicly supported the Proposed Constitutional Amendment to ban the 6x1 work schedule?\nANSWER: YES, labor unions in Brazil have publicly supported the Proposed Constitutional Amendment to ban the 6x1 work schedule.\n\n- The proposal is supported by the \"Vida Além do Trabalho\" (Life Beyond Work) movement, which has been backed by various labor unions and has gathered significant public support, including over 1.3 million signatures on an online petition[4].\n- Trade unions have been demanding a reform of the 6x1 scale for years, and the current proposal has been endorsed by several union groups who see it as a step towards better working conditions and more respect for rest time[2][4].\n- The protests and rallies against the 6x1 work schedule, which were led by activists and supported by workers, further indicate the support of labor unions for this amendment[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there ongoing public support and active campaigning for the ban on the 6x1 work schedule in Brazil?\nANSWER: Yes, there is ongoing public support and active campaigning for the ban on the 6x1 work schedule in Brazil.\n\n- Thousands of workers in various Brazilian cities have participated in protests and rallies against the 6x1 work schedule, demanding better working conditions and more rest time[2][3].\n- The proposal to end the 6x1 scale has significant support from social media, with a popular online petition gathering over 1.3 million signatures[5].\n- The \"Life Beyond Work\" (Vida Além do Trabalho) movement, along with other social and labor organizations, has been actively campaigning for this change, distributing leaflets, and organizing demonstrations across the country[1][3][5].\n- The issue has gained traction on social media platforms and has been a trending topic, indicating widespread public interest and support[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Brazilian legislative process expected to complete all necessary steps for the amendment before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is unclear whether the Brazilian legislative process will complete all necessary steps for the amendment before January 1, 2025.\n\n- The public consultation on the regulation of digital markets, including Draft Bill No. 2,768/22, is ongoing, with a deadline for submissions on March 18, 2024. However, the legislative process involves multiple phases, including review by the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate, which can be lengthy and does not have a specified completion date[1][2][4].\n- The legislative calendar of the National Congress, which includes sessions from February 2 to July 17 and from August 1 to December 22, suggests that the process could continue into 2025, especially given the complexity and the multiple steps involved in passing legislation[2][5].\n\nTherefore, the information available does not confirm that all necessary steps will be completed before January 1, 2025.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent shift in the balance of power in the Brazilian Congress that favors the approval of the Proposed Constitutional Amendment?\nANSWER: The information provided indicates a significant shift in the balance of power within the Brazilian legislative system, but it does not specifically address the approval of a particular proposed constitutional amendment.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n- Since the 2000s, the Brazilian Congress has grown more powerful, playing a more active role in policymaking and budgetary control. This includes significant budgetary powers, such as the ability to allocate substantial funds through parliamentary amendments and intervene in budget execution[1][2][4].\n- The Congress has been able to pass and influence major legislative and budgetary decisions, often independently of the executive branch. For example, they have passed a constitutional amendment to reform the consumption tax system and have been involved in other significant policy reforms[2][3][4].\n- However, the sources do not provide specific details on whether this increased power has led to the approval of a particular proposed constitutional amendment.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the approval of a particular proposed constitutional amendment, the answer to whether there has been a recent shift in the balance of power that favors the approval of such an amendment is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n36 days (from 2024-11-25 to 2025-01-01)\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf there are no changes in the legislative process, Brazil will **not** ban the 6x1 work schedule. The current 6x1 schedule will remain in place.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 9 days left, the likelihood of the legislative process being completed is extremely low. The probability of the ban passing in this scenario would be around **5%**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith around 144 days, there would be sufficient time for the proposal to navigate through the legislative stages, gather the necessary support, and potentially overcome opposition. In this extended timeline, the probability of the ban passing would increase to approximately **65%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe Proposed Constitutional Amendment (PEC) to ban the 6x1 work schedule in Brazil, as of November 25, 2024, has garnered significant support, including over 70 parliamentarians and substantial public backing with more than 2.9 million signatures on the online petition. Labor unions and the \"Life Beyond Work\" movement are actively advocating for the change, emphasizing the negative impacts of the current work schedule on health and family life.\n\nHowever, the amendment faces considerable resistance from conservative and far-right political parties, as well as from industries reliant on the 6x1 schedule. The legislative process in Brazil is notably slow and complex, often requiring extensive debates, committee reviews, and multiple votes in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Given that the proposal has not yet been approved by the Chamber of Deputies and is still in the early stages of the legislative process, the tight remaining timeline of 36 days poses a significant challenge.\n\nHistorical patterns of labor reforms in Brazil indicate that similar amendments typically take longer to implement. Although there is momentum and active campaigning supporting the amendment, the limited time left makes it unlikely that all necessary legislative steps will be successfully completed before the deadline.\n\n**Probability:** 25%",
