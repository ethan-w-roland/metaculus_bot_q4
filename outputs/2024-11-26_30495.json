    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the temperature in New York, NY ever go below 25 degrees F in the entire month of December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-26\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the low temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is ever below 25 degrees for the New York City weather station, as reported [here](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/hist.phtml?station=NYC&network=NY_ASOS&year=2024&month=12). If the low for any day has not been below that, then this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nMissing data for any of the observed values (coded by the NWS as \"MM\") will not be considered.   No other resolution source other than the Data Calendar posted at Iowa State University will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn December 2022, this occurred, but in December 2023 it did not. According to [Iowa State University](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/), \"The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) collects environmental data from cooperating members with observing networks. The data are stored and made available on this website.\" \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if the temperature in New York City will go below 25 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately -4°C) in December 2024, here are some key points from the available sources:\n\n## Historical and Forecasted Temperatures\n- The average temperatures in New York City in December typically range from highs around 43°F (6°C) to lows around 32°F (0°C)[1][3][4].\n- Specific forecasts for December 2024 indicate temperatures fluctuating, but generally staying within the range of 32°F to 48°F (0°C to 9°C) for most days[2][5].\n\n## Low Temperature Expectations\n- There are predictions of some days having lower temperatures, but these are generally not expected to drop below 25°F (-4°C). For example, on December 24, the forecast shows a low of around 32°F (0°C)[2][5].\n- Historical data suggests that while temperatures can drop significantly, they rarely go below 25°F in December, especially in the early part of the month[1][3].\n\n## Unpredictability\n- December weather in New York City can be unpredictable, with occasional fluctuations in temperature and weather patterns. However, the forecasts provided do not indicate temperatures below 25°F (-4°C) for any day in December 2024[1][2][5].\n\nGiven this information, while it is not impossible for temperatures to drop below 25°F (-4°C) due to the unpredictable nature of weather, the current forecasts and historical data suggest that it is unlikely.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the available forecasts and historical data, it is unlikely but not impossible for the temperature to go below 25°F (-4°C) in New York City during December 2024. However, the question cannot be answered with absolute certainty as weather forecasts can change.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have climate models projected a colder than average December for New York City in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information regarding climate model projections for a specific temperature outlook for December 2024 in New York City. The sources discuss general climate change impacts, sea level rise, and events related to Climate Week NYC, but they do not include specific weather forecasts or climate model projections for December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has New York City experienced temperatures below 25 degrees Fahrenheit in December at least once in the past 5 years?\nANSWER: Yes, New York City has experienced temperatures below 25 degrees Fahrenheit in December at least once in the past 5 years.\n\nAccording to the data from December 2019, the lowest temperature recorded was 16 °F on December 19, which is below 25 °F[1].\n\nAdditionally, looking at the lowest temperatures for each year, December 2022 had a low of 7 °F on December 24, which is also below 25 °F[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any meteorological agencies issued warnings about potential extreme cold in New York City for December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no specific warnings issued by meteorological agencies about potential extreme cold in New York City for December 2024. The sources discuss general winter outlooks and the potential impacts of a weak La Niña, but they do not mention specific warnings for extreme cold in December 2024.\n\n- The sources talk about the overall winter weather patterns and expectations, including the possibility of cooler and wetter conditions, but do not specify warnings for December[3][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the temperature in New York City on any day in December fallen below 25 degrees Fahrenheit in the past 10 years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no evidence that the temperature in New York City has fallen below 25 degrees Fahrenheit on any day in December over the past 10 years.\n\n- The source from Current Results provides the lowest temperatures for each year in New York City, including December, but does not show any temperature below 25°F for the years 2013 to 2022[2].\n- The other sources do not provide specific daily temperature data for the past 10 years that would indicate temperatures below 25°F in December.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current trend in global temperatures decreasing, potentially leading to colder winters in New York City in 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe current trend in global temperatures is not decreasing; instead, it is consistently showing record-high temperatures. Here are the key points:\n\n- October 2024 was the second warmest October on record globally, and the January–October global surface temperature ranked as the warmest in the 175-year record[1][3][4].\n- It is virtually certain that 2024 will be the warmest year on record and the first year with global temperatures more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels[3][4].\n- The summer of 2024 was the hottest on record since global records began in 1880[5].\n\nThere is no indication of a trend towards decreasing global temperatures or colder winters in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a La Niña or El Niño event expected to influence the weather patterns in New York City during December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is a significant likelihood of a La Niña event emerging and influencing weather patterns during the period that includes December 2024.\n\n- The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicts a 60% chance of La Niña developing from October 2024 to February 2025[2][3].\n- The National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center (CPC) also forecasts a 57% chance of La Niña emerging in October-December 2024 and persisting through January-March 2025[4][5].\n\nGiven that La Niña is expected to influence weather patterns in various regions, including the United States, during this period, it is likely that La Niña will influence the weather in New York City during December 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an upcoming Arctic air mass forecasted to impact New York City in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are indications of cold air outbreaks and variable winter weather patterns, but specific forecasts for an Arctic air mass impacting New York City in December 2024 are not explicitly stated.\n\n- The Arctic Oscillation (AO) and polar vortex forecasts suggest potential cold air outbreaks, but these are more generalized and do not specifically mention New York City[1].\n- NOAA's winter outlook predicts colder-than-average conditions in the north-central Plains and wetter-than-average conditions in the northern tier of the U.S., including the Northeast, but it does not provide a specific forecast for an Arctic air mass impacting New York City in December[2][5].\n- AccuWeather's forecast mentions brief blasts of cold air and lake-effect snow in the Northeast, which could include New York City, but it does not specify an Arctic air mass event for December 2024[4].\n\nGiven the lack of specific mention of an Arctic air mass impacting New York City in December, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant atmospheric anomalies expected to cause unusually low temperatures in New York City in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no clear indication of significant atmospheric anomalies that would cause unusually low temperatures in New York City specifically in December 2024.\n\n- The forecasts suggest that La Niña is expected to emerge and influence winter weather patterns, but its effects are generally more pronounced in other regions. For the Northeast, including New York, the predictions indicate above-normal winter precipitation, but the coastal regions near the Interstate 95 corridor, which include parts of New York City, are more likely to experience rain and sleet rather than unusually cold temperatures[1][2][5].\n- The National Weather Service forecasts suggest that the New York City metro area and Long Island are expected to have normal precipitation levels and do not indicate unusually low temperatures for these regions[1].\n- The overall pattern for the northern tier of the U.S. includes wetter-than-average conditions, but the specific temperature outlook for New York City does not suggest unusually low temperatures[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the historical frequency of December temperatures below 25 degrees Fahrenheit in New York City less than 10%?\nANSWER: To determine if the historical frequency of December temperatures below 25 degrees Fahrenheit in New York City is less than 10%, we need to analyze the historical temperature data for December in the city.\n\nFrom the sources provided:\n\n- The document on Below 0 Degree Day Facts for Central Park[1] lists specific days when temperatures were below 0°F, but it does not provide a comprehensive breakdown of all temperatures below 25°F.\n- The New York City climate overview[2] discusses various temperature anomalies and extreme weather events but does not provide a detailed frequency of temperatures below 25°F.\n- The New York Weather History for December[4] mentions average temperatures and some specific cold Decembers, but it does not give a detailed frequency of temperatures below 25°F.\n\nHowever, we can infer some general trends:\n- December temperatures in New York City can vary widely, with some years being quite cold and others relatively mild.\n- The average temperature for December in Central Park has historically been around the mid-30s to low 40s Fahrenheit, suggesting that temperatures below 25°F are not the norm but do occur.\n\nGiven the lack of specific frequency data in the provided sources, we cannot accurately calculate the exact percentage of December temperatures below 25°F. Therefore, the answer to whether the historical frequency of such temperatures is less than 10% remains unclear based on the available information.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any long-range weather forecasts predicting temperatures below 25 degrees Fahrenheit in New York City for December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are indications that temperatures could drop below 25 degrees Fahrenheit in New York City during December 2024, although the forecasts vary in specificity.\n\n1. **Weather2Travel.com** mentions daytime temperatures around 6°C (43°F) and nighttime temperatures as low as -1°C (30°F), but it does not specify any temperatures below 25°F (-4°C)[2].\n\n2. **Easeweather.com** provides a detailed daily temperature forecast, and some days are predicted to have temperatures below 25°F. For example, on December 24, the temperature is forecasted to be 0°F (-18°C) during the day and -3°F (-19°C) at night[1].\n\n3. **FOX 5 NY** discusses the winter outlook influenced by La Niña, suggesting that while the overall winter might be warmer than average, there can still be periods of cold temperatures. However, it does not provide specific temperature forecasts for December[3].\n\n4. **Weather25.com** mentions temperatures between 33°F and 41°F, but does not indicate any temperatures below 25°F[4].\n\n5. **Almanac.com** provides a long-range forecast that includes periods of cold weather. For example, the period from December 28-31 is forecasted as \"Snow, heavy south; cold,\" but it does not specify exact temperatures below 25°F[5].\n\nGiven these sources, the most direct evidence comes from **Easeweather.com**, which explicitly forecasts temperatures below 25°F on certain days in December.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- Today is November 26, 2024.\n- The outcome will be determined by December 31, 2024, or earlier if data is accessed.\n- **Time left:** 35 days.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- **Assessment:** Based on historical data from the past 10 years, New York City has experienced temperatures below 25°F in December at least twice in the last five years. Current December forecasts for 2024 indicate average lows around 32°F, with occasional forecasts suggesting the possibility of colder days.\n- **Probability if nothing changes:** 35%.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- **Time Scenario:** If only approximately 9 days were left until December 31, 2024.\n- **Assessment:** With less time remaining in the month, recent weather patterns and forecasts become more indicative. Given the historical occurrences and the possibility of cold snaps, the probability remains moderate.\n- **Probability with a quarter of the time left:** 35%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- **Time Scenario:** If there were approximately 140 days left until December 31, 2024.\n- **Assessment:** Extending the time frame beyond the current date doesn't significantly impact the probability for a specific month like December. The factors influencing December temperatures remain consistent.\n- **Probability with 4x the time left:** 35%.\n\n**Rationale:**\nConsidering the historical frequency of temperatures dropping below 25°F in New York City during December, combined with the current forecasts indicating average lows around 32°F with occasional colder days, the probability of experiencing at least one day below 25°F in December 2024 stands at a moderate likelihood. While climate trends show warming, the variability in weather patterns still allows for such cold events to occur sporadically.\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
