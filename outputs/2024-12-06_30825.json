    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill New Delhi experience a \"Hazardous\" air quality index for at least one third of the last two weeks of December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least 1/3 of the hourly values reported by [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov/international/us-embassies-and-consulates/#India$New_Delhi) for the dates December 16, 2024 to December 29, 2024 inclusive are categorized as having a \"Hazardous\" air quality index (AQI). If less than 1/3 of the hourly values are categorized as \"Hazardous\" air quality, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- The dates and times for this question will be the dates and times reported by AirNow. No adjustments based on timezones will be made.\n- If AirNow data are not available before January 7, 2025, this question will be **annulled**.\n- Data can be accessed under the \"Historical\" tab at the resolution source.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [Airnow](https://www.airnow.gov/aqi/aqi-basics/):\n\n>The U.S. Air Quality Index (AQI) is EPA's tool for communicating about outdoor air quality and health. The AQI includes six color-coded categories, each corresponding to a range of index values. The higher the AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality.\n\n>EPA establishes an AQI for five major air pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act. Each of these pollutants has a national air quality standard set by EPA to protect public health:\n\n> - ground-level ozone\n> - particle pollution (also known as particulate matter, including PM2.5 and PM10)\n> - carbon monoxide\n> - sulfur dioxide\n> - nitrogen dioxide\n\nOn November 21, 2024, CNN [reported](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/20/india/delhi-pollution-clinic-smog-climate-intl-hnk/index.html) that New Delhi had the most hazardous air for human health in the world, leading the Delhi Chief Minister to declare a \"medical emergency\" as authorities closed schools and urged people to stay home. On November 20, 2024 the reading for PM2.5, which has been linked to asthma, heart and lung disease, cancer, and cognitive impairment in children, was more than 77 times higher than safe levels set by the WHO.\n\nAt the time of this question, in 2024 year to date 6% of hours have had an AQI classified as Hazardous,  12% of hours have been Very Unhealthy, and 33% Unhealthy.

This period is known for severe air pollution[4][5].\n- In November 2024, Delhi recorded its worst air quality of the season, with an AQI reading of 795 on November 18, marking it as the most polluted day in recent history[3][4].\n\n## Current Air Quality Status\n- As of early December 2024, the AQI in New Delhi has been fluctuating but remains in the \"Poor\" to \"Unhealthy\" categories. For example, on December 5, 2024, the AQI ranged from 114 to 265[2].\n\n## Regulatory Measures\n- The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) has implemented the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which includes various stages of restrictions based on AQI levels. GRAP Stage 3, which includes stringent curbs like banning non-essential construction and restricting heavy vehicles, has been imposed when the AQI crosses 400[1].\n\n## Seasonal Factors\n- The winter season, characterized by temperature inversion and low wind speeds, tends to trap pollutants close to the ground, exacerbating air pollution. This is likely to continue through December[3][5].\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, Delhi's air quality during December is often severe due to the combination of winter weather conditions and other pollution factors. It is common for the AQI to reach hazardous levels during this time[4][5].\n\nGiven these points, it is plausible that New Delhi could experience \"Hazardous\" air quality for at least one third of the last two weeks of December 2024, considering the historical trends, current conditions, and ongoing seasonal factors that contribute to severe air pollution. However, the exact duration and frequency of such hazardous conditions would depend on various factors including weather patterns, enforcement of GRAP measures, and other pollution sources.\n\n### Time to Resolution\nThe air quality in Delhi is likely to remain a concern throughout the winter months, with significant improvements typically seen only when the weather conditions change, such as with the onset of warmer temperatures and increased wind speeds in the spring.\n\n### Superforecaster Relevant Details\n- **Historical Data**: Delhi's air quality has consistently been poor during winter months.\n- **Current Trends**: Recent AQI levels have been severe, and regulatory measures are in place to mitigate this.\n- **Seasonal Factors**: Winter conditions are likely to continue exacerbating air pollution.\n- **Base Rates**: Hazardous air quality is common during December in Delhi.\n\nThese factors suggest a high likelihood of hazardous air quality conditions persisting, but the exact duration would need to be monitored closely.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major industrial emissions reported in New Delhi in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information regarding major industrial emissions in New Delhi for December 2024. The sources discuss general contributors to air pollution, including industrial activities, but do not provide specific data or reports for December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has New Delhi experienced \"Hazardous\" AQI conditions for at least one third of the month in any December since 2015?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or mention of New Delhi experiencing \"Hazardous\" AQI conditions for at least one third of any December since 2015.\n\n- The sources primarily discuss the air quality conditions during the months of October, November, and the general trends, but they do not provide detailed month-by-month breakdowns for December specifically[1][2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is stubble burning occurring in areas surrounding New Delhi during December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, while they discuss the impact of stubble burning on Delhi's air quality, they do not specifically confirm whether stubble burning is still occurring in December 2024.\n\n- The sources mention that stubble burning is a significant issue during October and November, particularly after paddy harvesting[2][4].\n- There is mention of a reduction in stubble burning incidents, but this does not confirm whether the practice has completely stopped or is still ongoing in December[4].\n\nTherefore, the information available is not sufficient to definitively answer whether stubble burning is occurring in areas surrounding New Delhi during December 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there ongoing construction activity in New Delhi that contributes to air pollution during December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence to suggest that despite the bans and regulations in place, some construction activities have continued, contributing to air pollution.\n\n- A report by Supreme Court-appointed commissioners revealed ongoing construction at officials' homes in Delhi and NCR, violating the Grap-IV directives that prohibit non-essential construction to curb pollution[2].\n- The construction ban under Stage 4 of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) has been in effect since November 18, but there are indications that not all construction activities have ceased[5].\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that there could be ongoing construction activity in New Delhi that contributes to air pollution, even in December 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are temperature inversion events expected in New Delhi during the last two weeks of December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether temperature inversion events are specifically expected in New Delhi during the last two weeks of December 2024.\n\nWhile the sources explain that temperature inversion is a common phenomenon in the Indo-Gangetic plains, including New Delhi, during the winter months due to natural and pollution-related factors[1][3][5], they do not provide a specific forecast for the last two weeks of December 2024.\n\nThe forecasts mentioned in the sources are generally for the early part of December, indicating warmer-than-usual temperatures and the absence of significant cold air influx, which might reduce the likelihood of severe temperature inversions during that period[2][4]. However, there is no detailed forecast for the last two weeks of December. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has New Delhi recorded any \"Hazardous\" AQI values in December 2024 so far?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- The source from December 4, 2024, indicates that the AQI levels in New Delhi have been fluctuating, with the worst AQI level recorded at 265 (Unhealthy) and the best at 114 (Poor) in the last 24 hours. However, it does not specify any \"Hazardous\" category readings for December 2024[1].\n- Another source mentions that Delhi's AQI can reach \"hazardous\" levels, but it specifically refers to an event in November 2024, not December 2024[2][3].\n\nGiven the information available up to December 4, 2024, there is no explicit mention of \"Hazardous\" AQI values (which would be above 301 on the Indian AQI scale) in December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant weather anomalies predicted to persist in New Delhi through the end of December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are indications of significant weather anomalies predicted to persist in New Delhi through the end of December 2024.\n\n- The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasts that December in Delhi-NCR will experience mostly above-normal temperatures, extending the trend of an above-normal winter seen so far this year. This is attributed to a series of western disturbances that are unlikely to bring a significant influx of cold air[3].\n- The monthly mean temperature in December 2024 is expected to be around 17.5°C, which is above the normal mean temperature of 15.5°C[1].\n- There is an expectation of minimal impact from western disturbances on the plains, resulting in temperatures remaining around or above normal, with no significant dip anticipated unless there is moderate to heavy snowfall in the higher regions[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is vehicular traffic in New Delhi unusually high during December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, vehicular traffic in New Delhi is expected to be unusually high during December 2024 due to several factors:\n\n- Farmers' protests on December 6 are anticipated to cause significant traffic disruptions at various border areas and central hubs in Delhi, including the Singhu Border, Tikri Border, and Ghazipur Border, as well as in central Delhi areas like Jantar Mantar, Connaught Place, and Parliament Street[1].\n\n- On December 31, New Year's Eve celebrations are expected to lead to heavy traffic and congestion, particularly around crowded markets and shopping malls, with specific traffic advisories and diversions in place to manage the crowds[5].\n\n- Additionally, other events such as the INC rally near the Ghazipur Border on December 4 also contributed to traffic congestion in the area[4].\n\nThese events indicate that vehicular traffic in New Delhi will be unusually high during December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has New Delhi implemented any new air quality regulations for December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, New Delhi has implemented new air quality regulations for December 2024, although the specific regulations have evolved over the period.\n\n- As of November 15, 2024, the Delhi government implemented GRAP 3 (Graded Response Action Plan 3) due to the AQI crossing 300, which included measures such as the suspension of construction activities, vehicle restrictions, and the introduction of monitoring tools at construction sites[1][3].\n- By November 18, 2024, the air quality had deteriorated further, leading to the implementation of GRAP Stage IV (Severe Plus) restrictions, which included even more stringent measures like transitioning schools to online classes and restrictions on specific vehicles[2].\n- However, by December 5, 2024, with an improvement in the AQI to 'moderate' levels, the CAQM relaxed the GRAP IV curbs to Stage II, which involves less stringent measures such as a ban on the use of coal and firewood in industries and commercial establishments[4].\n\nThus, the regulations have been adjusted based on the changing air quality conditions, indicating active management and implementation of new or adjusted air quality regulations throughout December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have wind speeds in New Delhi remained below average during December 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if wind speeds in New Delhi have remained below average during December 2024, we need to compare the current wind speeds with the average wind speeds for the month.\n\n- The average wind speed in New Delhi in December is around 1 m/s, which is relatively constant throughout the month[2][5].\n- For December 2024, the wind speeds have been reported as follows:\n  - Wind speeds were around 5.8 mph (approximately 2.6 m/s) on December 4[1].\n  - Forecasted wind speeds include reductions to 2 to 4 kmph (approximately 0.5 to 1 m/s) in the morning hours of December 10, and around 8 kmph (approximately 2 m/s) for the rest of the day[3].\n  - There are also mentions of wind speeds reaching up to 12 to 18 kmph (approximately 3 to 4 m/s) on certain days[3].\n\nGiven these observations, the wind speeds in December 2024 have not consistently remained below the average of 1 m/s. Instead, they have often been at or above this average, especially when considering the forecasted and reported speeds.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n23 days (from December 6, 2024, to December 29, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions persist without any significant changes, the probability of New Delhi experiencing a \"Hazardous\" AQI for at least one third of the last two weeks of December 2024 would align closely with historical averages and the existing 6% Hazardous hours recorded year-to-date. This would likely result in a probability below the threshold required for a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 5.75 days remaining until resolution, the probability of reaching the \"Hazardous\" AQI threshold would be lower due to the shorter time frame. The likelihood might decrease to around 20%, considering less time for cumulative Hazardous conditions to occur.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nIf there were about 92 days until resolution, the extended period would provide more opportunities for Hazardous AQI conditions to accumulate. In such a scenario, the probability might increase to approximately 40%, reflecting the greater potential for adverse air quality events over a longer duration.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAs of December 6, 2024, New Delhi has recorded that 6% of the hours year-to-date have had a \"Hazardous\" AQI. Historical trends indicate that December typically experiences deteriorated air quality due to factors like temperature inversions, stubble burning, and increased vehicular traffic. However, up to the current date, Hazardous conditions have not been predominant.\n\nConsidering the remaining 23 days until December 29, the likelihood of accumulating enough Hazardous AQI hours to meet or exceed one third of the total hours in the last two weeks is moderate. Regulatory measures are in place, such as the Graded Response Action Plan, which may help mitigate some pollution sources. Additionally, wind speeds have not consistently remained below average, potentially aiding in the dispersion of pollutants.\n\nGiven the balance between historical severity and current mitigative efforts, it is plausible but not highly probable that New Delhi will reach the Hazardous AQI threshold for the specified duration. Therefore, a calibrated probability estimate accounts for both the potential for severe pollution and the interventions aimed at controlling it.\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
