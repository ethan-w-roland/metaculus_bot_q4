    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill New Zealand report >375 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-03\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if the total number of cases reported by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research's Pertussis Dashboard for both weeks 51 and 52, when they are posted exceeds 375.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- Week 51 ends on December 20, 2024, and the data are expected to be posted on December 25, 2024. Week 52 ends on December 27, 2024, and the data are expected to be posted on January 1, 2025.\r\n- This question will resolve on the first day after January 1, 2025 that data for both weeks are shown on the dashboard. Potential data revisions will not change the resolution. If the relevant numbers are not available on the dashboard before January 7, 2025, Admins may use alternative [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions), as long as their numbers are consistent with the dashboard's numbers.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nWhooping cough is a serious disease. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough):\r\n> Whooping cough also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough, is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable bacterial disease. Initial symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough, but these are followed by two or three months of severe coughing fits. Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in. The violent coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase \"100-day cough\". The cough may be so hard that it causes vomiting, rib fractures, and fatigue. Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods when they cannot breathe.\r\n\r\nOn 22 November 2024, the Ministry of Health of New Zealand [declared](https://www.health.govt.nz/news/whooping-cough-epidemic-declared-across-aotearoa-new-zealand) an epidemic of whooping cough across the country, as cases have been rising with 263 cases over the four weeks from mid October to mid November.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of New Zealand reporting more than 375 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Epidemic Status\nNew Zealand has recently declared a whooping cough epidemic, with 263 cases reported in the four weeks leading up to November 15, which is the highest number of cases over a month in 2024[1][2][4].\n\n## Case Trends\nThe number of whooping cough cases has continued to rise, with the total cases for the year surpassing 1000 by the end of November. In the week ending November 22, 77 cases were reported, including four hospitalised cases, three of which were under the age of 1[3].\n\n## Historical Context\nWhooping cough epidemics in New Zealand can last for several months to over a year. The last major outbreak was in 2017, and health officials have indicated that the current epidemic is expected to be a long and slow one, potentially lasting up to 18 months[1][3].\n\n## Regional Distribution\nThe infection rates are not uniform across the country, with certain regions like Wairarapa having significantly higher infection rates (25.4 cases per 100,000 people)[2].\n\n## Vaccination Efforts\nHealth officials are emphasizing the importance of vaccination, particularly for pregnant individuals and the extended family of newborns, to protect vulnerable groups. However, the effectiveness of these measures may take some time to manifest in reduced case numbers[1][4].\n\n## Forecasting Considerations\nGiven the current trend of high case numbers and the expectation that the epidemic will be prolonged, it is plausible that the case numbers could remain high for the upcoming weeks. However, predicting exact numbers involves significant uncertainty due to factors like vaccination uptake, public health interventions, and natural fluctuations in disease spread.\n\n### Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- The current base rate of cases is high, with over 77 cases reported in a single week.\n- The epidemic is expected to last several months, suggesting that high case numbers could persist.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Previous epidemics have shown that whooping cough can maintain high case numbers for extended periods.\n- The recent surge in cases and the declaration of an epidemic indicate a heightened level of transmission.\n\n### Special Considerations\n- Public health responses, including vaccination campaigns, may influence case numbers but may not immediately reduce them.\n- Seasonal factors and other health trends could also impact the spread of the disease.\n\nGiven these points, while it is uncertain whether the exact number will exceed 375, the ongoing epidemic and recent case trends suggest that it is plausible for the case numbers to remain high. However, without more precise data on the current rate of transmission and the effectiveness of ongoing public health measures, it is challenging to make a definitive prediction.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did New Zealand declare a whooping cough epidemic in November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nHealth officials in New Zealand declared a whooping cough epidemic in November 2024, as indicated by multiple sources[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are regional infection rates for whooping cough in New Zealand higher than 25 cases per 100,000 people in any region?\nANSWER: No, the regional infection rates for whooping cough in New Zealand are not higher than 25 cases per 100,000 people in any region, based on the available data.\n\nThe highest rate reported is in the Wairarapa region, which has an infection rate of 25.4 cases per 100,000 people[1][5]. This is the highest rate mentioned across the different health districts.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been an increase in hospitalizations due to whooping cough in New Zealand in the past month?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThere has been an increase in hospitalizations due to whooping cough in New Zealand in the past month. The sources indicate that health officials have declared a national whooping cough epidemic, and there have been significant hospitalizations, particularly among young babies. For example, 63 cases under 12 months old were reported, with almost three quarters of those (46) being hospitalised[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the total number of whooping cough cases in New Zealand exceeded 1000 by the end of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the total number of whooping cough cases in New Zealand exceeded 1000 by the end of November 2024. All the sources mention that there were 263 cases of whooping cough in the four weeks leading up to November 15, 2024, but they do not provide a total cumulative number of cases for the entire year or specifically for November[1][2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been more than 75 whooping cough cases reported in any single week in New Zealand since mid October 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been more than 75 whooping cough cases reported in a four-week period since mid-October 2024, which implies that the weekly average exceeds 75 cases.\n\n- In the four weeks from October 19 to November 15, there were 263 cases of whooping cough, which is the highest number over a four-week period to date for all of 2024[1][4][5].\n- This averages out to approximately 65.75 cases per week, but given the total number and the distribution, it is clear that some weeks had more than 75 cases, especially considering the overall trend of increasing cases.\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to conclude that there have been weeks with more than 75 cases reported.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have vaccination efforts for vulnerable groups in New Zealand shown signs of reducing whooping cough case numbers?\nANSWER: The current sources do not provide direct evidence that recent vaccination efforts have specifically reduced whooping cough case numbers in New Zealand. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources indicate a high risk and ongoing epidemic of whooping cough in New Zealand, with rising case numbers and hospitalizations, particularly among vulnerable groups like babies and young children[2][3][4].\n- They emphasize the importance of vaccination in preventing whooping cough and reducing its severity, especially for pregnant people, babies, and those in close contact with vulnerable groups[2][3][4].\n- However, they do not provide data or statistics showing a decrease in case numbers as a direct result of the current vaccination efforts.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current transmission rate of whooping cough in New Zealand higher than during the last major outbreak in 2017?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not directly compare the current transmission rate of whooping cough in New Zealand to the specific rates during the last major outbreak in 2017. However, they do provide some context and data that can be considered:\n\n- The current outbreak has seen 263 cases in the four weeks to November 15, which is the highest number of cases over a month so far in 2024[1][3][5].\n- The sources mention that the numbers of pertussis are among the highest recorded in New Zealand since early 2019, but they do not specify the exact rates or numbers from 2017 for a direct comparison[2].\n\nGiven this information, it is unclear whether the current transmission rate is higher than during the last major outbreak in 2017, as the specific data from 2017 is not provided.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are vaccination campaigns for whooping cough actively being promoted in New Zealand as of December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, vaccination campaigns for whooping cough are actively being promoted in New Zealand as of December 2024. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- Health authorities have declared a national whooping cough epidemic and are promoting vaccination to protect vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, newborn babies, and older adults[1][3][4].\n- Public health services are urging pregnant women to get immunized to protect their babies, and they are encouraging on-time immunization for all babies and boosters for children and eligible adults[2][3].\n- Community providers are organizing immunisation events and clinics to vaccinate hapū māmā and pēpi, and free vaccines are available at various health services and pharmacies[2].\n- Health experts and organizations are calling for urgent widespread vaccination to protect those most vulnerable, including those with existing respiratory conditions[5].\n\nThese efforts indicate active promotion of vaccination campaigns against whooping cough in New Zealand.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there credible alternative sources reporting whooping cough cases in New Zealand consistent with the Institute of Environmental Science and Research's Pertussis Dashboard?\nANSWER: Yes, there are credible alternative sources reporting whooping cough cases in New Zealand that are consistent with the information from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research's Pertussis Dashboard.\n\n- The article from Immune.org.nz mentions that there have been 263 cases of pertussis in the past four weeks, which is among the highest recorded since early 2019. This aligns with the high case numbers reported in other sources[1][2].\n- The Te Whatu Ora news update also reports a significant rise in whooping cough cases, with 187 cases in September 2024, and highlights the risk of a national outbreak, which is consistent with the declaration of a national epidemic[3].\n- The ReliefWeb report confirms that health agencies in New Zealand declared the early stages of a national whooping cough epidemic on 22 November 2024, with 1,008 cases reported up to that date, including 292 cases in the past four weeks. This matches the data from the Pertussis Dashboard[4].\n- The Healthify.nz article also mentions the declaration of a national whooping cough epidemic and the high levels of pertussis cases and hospitalizations, which is in line with the other reports[5].\n\nThese sources all corroborate the information about the rising cases and the declaration of a national whooping cough epidemic in New Zealand.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are public health interventions targeting whooping cough being effectively implemented in New Zealand?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that public health interventions targeting whooping cough are being implemented in New Zealand, but the effectiveness can be assessed in various ways:\n\n1. **Vaccination Programs**: There are clear guidelines and recommendations for vaccination against whooping cough, including free vaccinations for pregnant women, babies, and certain at-risk groups. This includes booster doses for adults and healthcare workers[2][3][4].\n\n2. **Public Health Alerts and Guidelines**: Public health alerts have been issued, and detailed guidelines are in place for healthcare professionals to manage the current epidemic. This includes testing, treatment, and isolation protocols[1][2][4].\n\n3. **Awareness and Education**: Information is being disseminated to the public, healthcare professionals, and specific groups such as early childhood services and schools to reduce the spread of the disease[1][3][4].\n\n4. **Targeted Interventions**: There are targeted interventions for high-risk groups, such as infants under one year, pregnant women, and those with certain health conditions. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for high-priority contacts[2][3][5].\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of these interventions in completely controlling the epidemic is not explicitly stated in the sources. The ongoing high levels of pertussis cases and hospitalizations indicate that while efforts are being made, the epidemic is still a significant public health concern.\n\nGiven this information, the answer would be:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\nWhile public health interventions are clearly being implemented, the sources do not provide a definitive assessment of their overall effectiveness in controlling the epidemic.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- Approximately 5 weeks remain until the outcome is known. The data for Week 51 will be available on December 25, 2024, and for Week 52 on January 1, 2025. The final resolution will occur by January 7, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- If current trends continue without any changes, it is likely that New Zealand will report more than 375 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52. This expectation is based on the ongoing epidemic status, rising case numbers, and historical case trends indicating prolonged high transmission rates.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- With only about 1.25 weeks left, the probability of exceeding 375 cases would decrease. The shorter timeframe limits the ability for case numbers to escalate sufficiently. In this scenario, the probability might be around 40%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- If there were approximately 20 weeks left, the probability of exceeding 375 cases for any two consecutive weeks might increase due to the extended period allowing for sustained or increasing transmission rates. However, since the question pertains to specific weeks (51 and 52), extending the timeframe doesn’t directly apply, making this scenario less relevant. Nonetheless, if forced to estimate, the probability could rise to around 70%.\n\n**Rationale:**\nNew Zealand is currently experiencing an ongoing whooping cough epidemic, declared by health authorities in November 2024. With 263 cases reported over four weeks leading up to mid-November, the average weekly cases are approximately 65. To exceed 375 cases over Weeks 51 and 52, an average of about 188 cases per week would be necessary. Given the current trajectory and regional hotspots like Wairarapa, there is a plausible risk of case numbers increasing, especially if public health interventions take time to show effectiveness. However, achieving the threshold of 375 cases in just two weeks would require a significant spike, which, while possible, is uncertain. \n\nConsidering factors such as vaccination efforts, public health measures, and historical data from previous epidemics, there is a moderate likelihood that the case numbers could reach or exceed the specified threshold. The probability balances the current high transmission rates against the potential impact of ongoing health interventions.\n\n**Probability: 60%**",
