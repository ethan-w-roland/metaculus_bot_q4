    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Alpental ski resort be listed as Open by On the Snow's Ski Report on December 6, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if On the Snow's Alpental Snow Report, currently located [here](https://www.onthesnow.com/washington/alpental/skireport), reports the ski resort's operating status as Open when accessed by Metaculus on or after December 6, 2024. If it is reported as Closed, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. In case of the resolution source being down, Metaculus Admins will wait until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFrom the resolution source: \"Alpental (German for alpine valley) is one of four base areas at the Summit at Snoqualmie, separated from the other three by Interstate 90. Alpental offers the most advanced and expert terrain at the area with runs like Upper International and Shot Six. The area provides some of the steepest and deepest terrain, but itâ€™s also great for beginner skiers and boarders.\n\nWhere Is Alpental Ski Resort Located?\nThe Summit at Snoqualmie is an hour from Seattle on Interstate 90.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the Alpental ski resort will be listed as open by On the Snow's Ski Report on December 6, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Conditions and Forecast\n- As of December 4, 2024, Alpental At The Summit has no lifts open, and the resort runs are closed[2].\n- The weather forecast indicates heavy rain and mild temperatures in the immediate future, with a transition to colder conditions and snowfall expected around Saturday, December 7[1].\n\n## Projected Opening Dates\n- The projected opening date for the 2024/25 ski season at Snoqualmie Pass, which includes Alpental, is December 6, 2024. However, these dates are subject to change and are not yet official[5].\n\n## Snow Conditions\n- Currently, there is no significant snowfall forecasted before December 6, and the base depth is not sufficient to support opening the resort[1][3].\n\nGiven these points, while the projected opening date is December 6, 2024, the current snow conditions and weather forecast suggest that it might be challenging for the resort to open on this date. However, the final decision would depend on the specific conditions and any last-minute changes.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer to whether Alpental will be listed as open on December 6, 2024, is not immediately clear based on the current information. It will depend on the actual snow conditions and any updates to the projected opening date. Therefore, it cannot be definitively answered as yes or no without further updates from the resort or On the Snow's Ski Report.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is On the Snow's Ski Report accessible and functioning properly on December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not mention anything about the accessibility or functionality of On the Snow's Ski Report on December 6, 2024. Therefore, the information is insufficient to determine whether On the Snow's Ski Report is accessible and functioning properly on that date.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Alpental ski resort historically opened on December 6 under similar weather conditions?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information that indicates Alpental ski resort has historically opened on December 6 under similar weather conditions. The sources provide general opening dates for recent seasons but do not specify a consistent opening date of December 6 across all years or under similar weather conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any operational delays or maintenance scheduled at Alpental ski resort for December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about operational delays or maintenance scheduled at Alpental ski resort for December 6, 2024. The sources mention projected opening dates and current conditions but do not detail any planned delays or maintenance for that specific date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is road access to Alpental ski resort clear and open on December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically address the condition of road access to Alpental ski resort on December 6, 2024. While they discuss various aspects of the ski resort, such as lift construction, hours of operation, and projected opening dates for the ski season, they do not mention the status of road access on that specific date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any significant snowfall expected at Alpental ski resort before December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the relevant information regarding snowfall at Alpental ski resort before December 6, 2024:\n\n- From the snow forecast for Alpental At The Summit, there is an expectation of heavy rain until Friday night, followed by a transition to colder conditions with heavy snowfall starting on Saturday night[1].\n- The detailed forecast indicates that significant snowfall is expected to start on Saturday night, which is after December 6[1][2][4].\n\nTherefore, there is no significant snowfall expected at Alpental ski resort before December 6, 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there sufficient base snow accumulation at Alpental ski resort to support open operations on December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, as of November 19, 2024, Alpental at The Summit at Snoqualmie had a base depth of only 11 inches, which is significantly below the typical requirement for opening. The resort typically needs at least a couple of feet of snow to open Summit West and even more to open Alpental[1].\n\nGiven that there is no updated information provided between November 19 and December 6, 2024, indicating a substantial increase in snowfall, it is unlikely that the base snow accumulation would be sufficient to support open operations by December 6, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been an official announcement from Alpental ski resort regarding their opening status for December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there has been an indication of a projected opening date for Alpental ski resort, but it is not clear if this is an official announcement from the resort itself.\n\n- The source from OnTheSnow indicates that Alpental is projected to open on December 6, 2024, but notes that these dates are subject to change and not all dates listed are official and final[3].\n- The Summit at Snoqualmie's website mentions that they do not have a set opening day yet and are waiting for enough natural snowfall, but it does not provide a specific official announcement for Alpental's opening date[5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is heavy rain forecasted at Alpental ski resort on December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the relevant information:\n\n- From the snow forecast for Alpental At The Summit, it is indicated that there will be \"heavy rain (total 21.0mm), heaviest during Fri night\" which includes December 6, 2024. However, the heavy rain is specifically mentioned to be heaviest during Friday night, not necessarily during the day[1].\n- Another source mentions that on Friday, December 6, there is a chance of \"light rain\" and \"mixed precipitation\" but does not specify heavy rain during the day[3].\n\nGiven this information, while there is a chance of rain on December 6, the sources do not explicitly confirm that heavy rain is forecasted during the day of December 6, but rather indicate it is heaviest during the night.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the projected opening date for Alpental ski resort on December 6, 2024, confirmed?\nANSWER: The projected opening date for Alpental ski resort on December 6, 2024, is not confirmed. The sources indicate that the opening date for The Summit at Snoqualmie, which includes Alpental, has not been officially announced and is subject to change based on snow conditions.\n\n- The source from FOX 13 Seattle mentions that The Summit at Snoqualmie has not yet announced an opening date and needs more snow to create a healthy base[1].\n- The source from OnTheSnow suggests a projected opening date of December 6, 2024, for Snoqualmie Pass ski resorts, but notes that these dates are subject to change and not final[3].\n\nTherefore, the opening date is not confirmed.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are all lifts at Alpental ski resort operational as of December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: As of December 6, 2024, it is unclear if all lifts at Alpental ski resort are operational. Here are the key points:\n\n- The resort is in the midst of a multi-year investment plan, which includes lift replacements and new installations. Specifically, the replacement of the Sessel lift has been completed, but the new International triple and the replacement of Chair 2 (Edelweiss) are still in progress or postponed[1].\n- The International triple is scheduled to be completed before the 2024-25 season, but there is no confirmation that it will be fully operational by December 6, 2024[1].\n- Chair 2 (Edelweiss) has been postponed to the 2025-26 season, so it will not be operational by December 6, 2024[1].\n\nGiven this information, it is uncertain whether all lifts will be operational by December 6, 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 2 days (from December 4, 2024, to December 6, 2024).\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changes:** If current conditions persist without any significant snowfall or operational changes, Alpental ski resort is likely to remain closed. As of December 4, there are no lifts open, the base snow depth is insufficient (11 inches as of November 19), and significant snowfall is not expected before December 6. Additionally, heavy rain in the immediate future could further hinder any potential for opening.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (0.5 days remaining):** With only half a day left, there is minimal time for any positive changes. The lack of sufficient snow accumulation and ongoing operational uncertainties would likely keep the forecast similar to the current outlook. Therefore, the probability of Alpental being open would remain low.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there were 4x the time left (8 days remaining):** With an extended period, there is a slight chance for additional snowfall or operational adjustments that could facilitate an earlier opening. However, since the transition to colder conditions and significant snowfall is expected to begin on December 7, which is after the resolution date, the extended time still does not directly influence the outcome on December 6. The probability of opening remains low, with only indirect potential benefits from the extended timeframe.\n\n**Rationale:** Considering the current insufficient snow base, lack of lift operations, and weather forecasts indicating heavy rain with snowfall starting after December 6, the likelihood of Alpental ski resort being listed as open is minimal. Historical data does not show consistent openings on December 6 under similar conditions, and no official confirmation from the resort has been provided. Operational uncertainties and the need for adequate snow accumulation further diminish the chances of an early opening.\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
