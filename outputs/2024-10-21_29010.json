{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nOn October 31, 2024, will Nvidia's market capitalization be larger than Apple's?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves Yes if, on October 31, 2024, the market cap of Nvidia is greater than that of Apple, according to [Companies Market Cap](https://companiesmarketcap.com/), when checked by Metaculus at approximately 4 PM EDT (8 PM UTC).\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n* If Companies Market Cap is unavailable or if there are reasonable concerns as to the accuracy of its data at resolution time, Metaculus may consider other credible sources to resolve this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nSince late 2022, Nvidia Corporation has experienced nearly 10x growth in market capitalization, driven by its [dominance in the AI chip market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-ai-chip-dominance-continue-210200974.html). Nvidia's GPUs are critical in the development of large language models, and are highly sought after by major tech companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nOn May 22nd, Nvidia released [impressive Q1 financial results](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-first-quarter-fiscal-2025#:~:text=NVIDIA%20(NASDAQ%3A%20NVDA)%20today,262%25%20from%20a%20year%20ago.) and simultaneously announced a 10:1 stock split and increase to its dividend, sending its stock price to new all-time highs.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Nvidia's market capitalization exceeding Apple's by October 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Market Capitalization\nAs of recent reports, Nvidia's market capitalization has already surpassed Apple's, with Nvidia valued at over $3 trillion and Apple at around $3.37 trillion, although these figures can fluctuate rapidly.\n\n## Growth Trends\nNvidia is experiencing rapid growth driven by its dominance in the AI chip market. The company has seen significant revenue increases, with a 122% year-over-year growth in the second quarter of its fiscal year 2025 and projected 80% year-over-year growth in the next quarter. Wall Street analysts predict Nvidia's revenue will grow by around 42% next year, far outpacing Apple's projected 8% growth.\n\n## Profit Margins and Valuation\nNvidia's profit margins are substantially higher than Apple's, at 55% compared to Apple's 26%. This, combined with its rapid growth, makes Nvidia's valuation highly attractive to investors. The company's strong growth and high profit margins are key factors that could sustain or even increase its market capitalization relative to Apple.\n\n## Market and Investor Sentiment\nNvidia's stock has been performing exceptionally well, with a 239% gain in 2023 and an additional 181% gain so far in 2024. Analysts have increased their price targets for Nvidia, and the company's partnership with major players like Foxconn and Microsoft, as well as its upcoming Blackwell architecture, continue to drive investor confidence.\n\n## Competition and Market Dynamics\nWhile competition in the AI chip market is increasing, Nvidia currently controls around 70% of the market and is well ahead of its competitors. This dominance, coupled with the growing demand for AI chips, suggests that Nvidia's market position is strong and likely to remain so in the near future.\n\nGiven these points, it is plausible that Nvidia's market capitalization could remain larger than Apple's by October 31, 2024, especially if Nvidia continues its current growth trajectory and maintains its market dominance in AI chips.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- **Historical Performance**: Nvidia's historical performance, particularly its recent growth, sets a strong precedent for continued success.\n- **Market Dominance**: Nvidia's control over the AI chip market is a significant factor in its valuation.\n- **Growth Projections**: Analysts' projections of continued high growth for Nvidia support the likelihood of its market capitalization remaining high.\n\n### Time to Resolution\nThe timeframe until October 31, 2024, is relatively short, and given the current trends, it is reasonable to expect that Nvidia's market capitalization could remain ahead of Apple's unless there are significant unforeseen changes in the market or the companies' performances.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that market conditions can be volatile, and various factors, including broader economic changes or unexpected shifts in consumer or investor sentiment, could influence the outcome. Therefore, while the current data suggests a high likelihood, it is not a certainty.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Nvidia maintain a profit margin higher than 50% in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Nvidia maintains a profit margin higher than 50% in 2024.\n\nAs of the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia's gross margin was 75.1%.\n\nFor the third quarter, the company expects the gross margin to be around 74.4%.\n\nThese figures are well above the 50% mark.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nvidia's stock price increased by over 200% in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Nvidia's stock price has increased by over 200% in 2024.\n\nAs mentioned in the sources, Nvidia's stock price has more than doubled this year. Specifically, it is noted that Nvidia's stock jumped 150% in the first half of 2024 and has continued to rise, with the stock having more than doubled since the beginning of the year. This indicates an increase of over 200% from the start of 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Apple's market capitalization greater than $3.3 trillion as of October 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the market capitalization of Apple as of October 21, 2024, is around $3.59 trillion.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the market capitalization as of October 31, 2024. Since the sources do not provide data beyond October 21, 2024, we cannot determine the exact market capitalization for October 31, 2024, from the given information.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nvidia retained over 70% of the AI chip market share as of October 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided in the sources, Nvidia has consistently been reported to hold a significant market share in the AI chip market.\n\n- As of June 2024, Nvidia was estimated to control between 70% and 95% of the market for AI chips used for training and deploying models.\n- Another source from June 2024 indicated that Nvidia has a market share of greater than 80% in AI chips.\n- A more recent source from October 2024 mentions that Nvidia currently supplies 80% of advanced AI chips used globally for training Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nGiven this consistent reporting across multiple sources, it is reasonable to conclude that as of October 31, 2024, Nvidia has retained over 70% of the AI chip market share.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Nvidia release a new GPU architecture by October 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Nvidia released a new GPU architecture by October 31, 2024. The sources discuss existing and upcoming products, such as the GeForce RTX 40 series and rumors about the RTX 5000 series, but do not mention any new architecture release by the specified date.\n\n- The GeForce RTX 40 series, which is based on the Ada Lovelace architecture, was launched in October 2022.\n- There are rumors about the RTX 5000 series, but these are expected to be announced at CES 2025, which is after the specified date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Nvidia announce any major partnerships with companies like Microsoft or Amazon in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Nvidia announced several major partnerships with companies like Microsoft and Amazon in 2024.\n\n- Nvidia and Amazon Web Services (AWS) extended their collaboration to advance generative AI, including the integration of Nvidia's Blackwell GPU platform with AWS's cloud infrastructure, such as Amazon EC2 instances and AWS Nitro System, to enhance security and performance for large language models.\n\n- Nvidia also announced partnerships with Microsoft, integrating its Blackwell GPU platform and DGX Cloud with Microsoft Azure. This includes the use of Nvidia's GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips and advanced networking solutions to support AI workloads, as well as the integration of Nvidia's Omniverse Cloud APIs with Azure.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Nvidia achieve at least 80% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of fiscal year 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Nvidia's revenue growth forecast for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 is expected to be between 75.8% and 82.9% year-over-year, but it does not confirm if the actual achieved growth met or exceeded 80%.\n\n- The revenue growth forecast for the third quarter is up to 83%, which is the first time in six quarters that it has been less than 100%, but this is a forecast rather than the actual result.\n\nSince the sources only provide guidance and not the actual results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been no significant regulatory actions against Nvidia that would negatively impact its market capitalization by October 31, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThere have been significant regulatory actions and investigations against Nvidia that have negatively impacted its market capitalization. Here are some key points:\n\n- The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has issued subpoenas to Nvidia as part of an antitrust investigation, seeking evidence that the company violated antitrust laws. This led to a significant drop in Nvidia's stock price and market capitalization.\n- French antitrust regulators are preparing to charge Nvidia with anticompetitive practices, which could result in fines of up to 10% of Nvidia's global annual revenue.\n- These regulatory actions and investigations have contributed to significant declines in Nvidia's stock price, including its worst single-day drop ever, resulting in a substantial loss in market capitalization.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Apple experience annual revenue growth below 10% in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer to whether Apple experienced annual revenue growth below 10% in 2024 is not definitively clear from the current data.\n\n- The sources provide quarterly revenue figures and growth rates, but they do not give the total annual revenue for 2024 yet. For example, Q1 2024 saw a 2% year-over-year revenue growth, and Q3 2024 saw a 5% year-over-year revenue growth, but the total annual figure for 2024 is not provided.\n- There is a projection that Apple is expected to generate around $390 billion in revenues in FY 2024, which is slightly below the $394.33 billion revenue of FY 2022 and the $383.29 billion of FY 2023. However, this is a projection and not a confirmed annual revenue figure.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Nvidia's market capitalization greater than $3 trillion as of October 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the relevant market capitalization values for NVIDIA as of the latest dates available:\n\n- As of October 21, 2024, NVIDIA's market capitalization was $3.49 trillion.\n- As of October 18, 2024, NVIDIA's market capitalization was $3.384 trillion.\n- As of October 15, 2024, NVIDIA's market capitalization was around $3.228 trillion to $3.386 trillion.\n\nGiven that the market capitalization was already above $3 trillion as of the dates closest to October 31, 2024, it is reasonable to conclude that NVIDIA's market capitalization would still be greater than $3 trillion as of October 31, 2024.\n\n**YES**", "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n\nThere are **10 days** remaining until October 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n\nIf current trends and conditions remain unchanged over the next 10 days, **Apple** would maintain a higher market capitalization than **Nvidia**. As of October 21, 2024, Apple's market cap is approximately \\$3.37 trillion compared to Nvidia's \\$3 trillion. Without significant market movements, this gap would likely persist.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n\nWith only **2-3 days** left until resolution, the window for Nvidia to surpass Apple's market cap narrows significantly. In such a short timeframe, substantial positive news for Nvidia (e.g., a major partnership announcement or a significant uptick in stock price) could influence the outcome. However, given the existing gap, the probability would decrease compared to the 10-day outlook.\n\n**Forecast Probability:** **20%**\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n\nWith **40 days** until resolution, Nvidia would have a more extended period to capitalize on growth opportunities, mitigate regulatory challenges, and respond to market dynamics. This longer timeframe allows for potential strategic moves, such as product launches or market expansions, that could enhance Nvidia's market position relative to Apple. However, it also introduces more variables that could impede rapid growth.\n\n**Forecast Probability:** **50%**\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the current date of October 21, 2024, and the resolution date of October 31, 2024, there are only 10 days left for Nvidia to potentially surpass Apple's market capitalization. Here's a synthesis of the key factors:\n\n1. **Current Market Positions:** As of October 21, Nvidia is valued at approximately \\$3 trillion, while Apple stands at around \\$3.37 trillion. The gap of roughly \\$370 billion would require Nvidia to experience a significant uptick in market cap within 10 days to overtake Apple.\n\n2. **Growth Trajectory:** Nvidia has demonstrated impressive growth, particularly in the AI chip market, with substantial revenue increases and high-profit margins. However, the explosive growth seen in previous years may be stabilizing as the company matures.\n\n3. **Regulatory Challenges:** Recent antitrust investigations by the US Department of Justice and French regulators pose potential risks to Nvidia's market valuation. These regulatory actions have already impacted investor sentiment and could continue to exert downward pressure on Nvidia's stock price.\n\n4. **Market Sentiment and Investor Confidence:** While Nvidia has strong partnerships and is pivotal in AI development, the short 10-day window limits the impact of positive news. Significant positive movements would be required to bridge the current market cap gap.\n\n5. **Stock Price Volatility:** The financial markets are inherently volatile, especially for tech stocks like Nvidia and Apple. While Nvidia's stock has shown remarkable gains, reversing or accelerating its trajectory within 10 days to outpace Apple's market cap is challenging.\n\n6. **Base Rates and Historical Precedence:** Historically, substantial market cap shifts within a short period are rare, especially between two established giants like Nvidia and Apple. Base rates suggest that without extraordinary catalysts, such rapid changes are unlikely.\n\nConsidering these factors, while Nvidia remains a strong contender with robust growth prospects, the short timeframe and existing market conditions make the likelihood of Nvidia surpassing Apple's market cap by October 31, 2024, moderate but not highly probable.\n\n**Probability: 35%**", "probability": 35}
