    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Dairy Recall Tracker maintained by the Center for Dairy Research show more than 1 recall for December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Dairy Recall Tracker at [this link](https://www.cdr.wisc.edu/dairy-recall-tracker) lists more than one recall in December 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on or after January 1, 2024. If it does not show >1 recall for December 2024, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. As long as the page can be accessed, if for any reason it does not show greater than 1 recall for December 2024, this question resolves as No. Please note that only recalls will be counted, which means that it must be listed as such either in the headline or the linked story. Other notices such as consumer alerts do not count.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe question of dairy recalls has taken on particular importance in 2024, due to [HPAI bird flu](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information provided, the Dairy Recall Tracker maintained by the Center for Dairy Research only includes recalls up to the current date, which is November 21, 2024. There is no data available for December 2024, as it has not yet occurred.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to determine from the current data whether there will be more than one recall for December 2024. The answer to this question cannot be clearly determined as yes or no based on the available information[2][3][5].\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Center for Dairy Research reported any recalls in November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe Center for Dairy Research has reported a recall in November 2024. Specifically, on November 5, 2024, Babcock Dairy recalled Orange Custard Chocolate Chip and Chocolate Peanut Butter ice cream due to a labeling error[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an increase in consumer complaints about dairy products in December 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe provided sources do not mention any specific data or reports regarding consumer complaints about dairy products in December 2024. They discuss various aspects of the dairy industry, including milk production trends, market prices, and a recall of Lactaid milk products, but do not provide information on consumer complaints for the specified month.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have dairy producers reported any quality control issues in the fourth quarter of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of quality control issues reported by dairy producers in the fourth quarter of 2024. The sources discuss various challenges and trends in the dairy industry for 2024, including declines in milk production, economic pressures, and regulatory issues, but they do not address quality control issues specifically for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Center for Dairy Research increased its monitoring of dairy products in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit statement indicating that the Center for Dairy Research (CDR) has increased its monitoring of dairy products in 2024. The sources discuss various ongoing activities, training programs, and updates, but they do not specify an increase in monitoring activities for 2024.\n\n- The sources detail ongoing programs and services such as environmental monitoring courses, food safety workshops, and other educational and troubleshooting services, but they do not mention a specific increase in monitoring[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any new regulations affecting dairy product safety in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of new regulations affecting dairy product safety that are set to take effect in December 2024.\n\n- The FDA's amendments to the yogurt standard of identity, including the pH level and other modifications, have a compliance date of January 1, 2024, not December 2024[1][2].\n- Other updates and regulations mentioned do not specify any changes or new regulations for dairy product safety effective in December 2024[3][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent outbreak of contamination in dairy farms in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent outbreaks of contamination in dairy farms associated with raw milk consumption in 2024.\n\n- A Salmonella outbreak linked to raw milk from Raw Farm LLC affected 165 people across four states, with the most recent illness reported in the past month as of July 2024[1].\n- In Washington State, there were outbreaks linked to raw milk consumption, including an E. coli outbreak associated with Cozy Vale Creamery in February 2024 and a Campylobacter outbreak linked to Old Silvana Creamery in July 2024[2][3].\n- Additionally, there were recalls and alerts for other raw milk contaminations, such as Listeria and Campylobacter, in various states throughout 2024[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been more than one dairy product recalls in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there has been at least one dairy product recall in November 2024.\n\n- On November 19, 2024, Babcock Dairy issued a recall for Orange Custard Chocolate Chip ice cream due to undeclared eggs[3][4].\n\nHowever, the sources do not mention any other dairy product recalls specifically in November 2024. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** as to whether there have been more than one dairy product recalls in November 2024, since only one is confirmed.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the rate of dairy product recalls in 2024 higher than in previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence to suggest that the rate of food recalls, including dairy products, has increased in 2024 compared to previous years.\n\n1. **Increased Food Recalls**: The sources indicate a significant surge in food recalls in 2024. For example, the number of food and beverage recalls in 2024 has more than doubled the total from 2023, with over 740 recalls reported so far[2].\n\n2. **Specific Dairy Recalls**: There are mentions of specific dairy product recalls in 2024, such as the recall of over 60 dairy products by a California-based manufacturer due to Listeria contamination. This suggests an active and possibly increased level of recall activity in the dairy sector[5].\n\n3. **General Trends**: The overall trend in food recalls, including dairy, shows an increase. For instance, the FDA and USDA have registered a higher number of food recall notifications in 2024 compared to previous years[4].\n\nGiven this information, it appears that the rate of dairy product recalls in 2024 is indeed higher than in previous years.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any ongoing investigations into dairy product safety related to HPAI bird flu?\nANSWER: Yes, there are ongoing investigations and monitoring efforts related to dairy product safety in the context of the HPAI (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza) bird flu outbreak.\n\n- The FDA, in collaboration with the USDA and other federal and state partners, is conducting various studies and monitoring programs to ensure the safety of dairy products. This includes testing raw milk and pasteurized milk products to confirm that pasteurization effectively inactivates the H5N1 virus[2][4][5].\n\n- The FDA has performed several studies, including a High Temperature Short Time (HTST) pasteurization validation study and retail dairy product sampling tests, which have confirmed that pasteurization is effective in inactivating the H5N1 virus in milk[4].\n\n- The USDA is also involved in surveillance and testing programs, including the National Residue Program (NRP), to monitor beef and dairy cattle for the presence of the H5N1 virus[2].\n\n- Additionally, the voluntary Dairy Herd Status Program and other monitoring studies are in place to reduce the risk of H5N1 circulation in dairy herds and to ensure the safety of dairy products[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major changes in the dairy supply chain in late 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several ongoing and anticipated changes in the dairy supply chain and industry dynamics, but whether these are specifically labeled as \"major changes\" in late 2024 is not explicitly stated. Here are some key points:\n\n## Federal Milk Marketing Order Modernization\nThe USDA is in the process of modernizing the Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO), with a Final Decision expected on November 12, 2024, followed by a dairy producer referendum. This modernization could significantly impact milk pricing transparency, compensation structures, and the overall regulatory framework for dairy producers[1].\n\n## Supply Chain Logistics\nThere are ongoing adaptations in dairy supply chain logistics, including the implementation of FSMA regulations, advancements in cold chain management, and the use of technological innovations such as blockchain, IoT, and AI. Additionally, the industry is addressing the driver shortage crisis with increased recruitment efforts and the exploration of autonomous vehicles[3].\n\n## Production Trends\nThe dairy industry is experiencing declining milk production, with year-over-year declines noted in various reports. This decline is attributed to shrinking herd sizes and limited heifer availability, which are significant challenges for the industry[2][4].\n\n## Market Dynamics\nDairy prices and market conditions are expected to fluctuate throughout 2024, influenced by factors such as global demand, consumer preferences, and supply disruptions. There are predictions of subdued prices in the first half of the year with potential improvements in the second half[5].\n\nGiven these points, while there are significant developments and changes in the dairy industry and supply chain, it is not explicitly stated that these changes are confined to or particularly intensified in late 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 47 days (from November 21, 2024, to January 7, 2025).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends continue without any new influencing factors, it is likely that there will be **1 or fewer recalls** for December 2024. This is based on existing recall data up to November 2024 and the absence of specific indicators pointing to multiple recalls in December.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about 12 days left (a quarter of the total time), the probability of observing more than one recall in December 2024 would decrease. In this scenario, the likelihood that no additional recalls beyond those already reported occur is higher.  \n**Forecasted Probability:** **30%**\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith an extended timeframe of approximately 188 days, there is a greater window for potential recalls to be reported. Given the increased rate of recalls in 2024 compared to previous years and ongoing investigations into dairy product safety, the probability of multiple recalls becomes more plausible over a longer period.  \n**Forecasted Probability:** **60%**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe Dairy Recall Tracker has reported at least one recall in November 2024, and there is evidence suggesting an elevated rate of dairy product recalls in 2024 compared to previous years. While specific indicators for December recalls are unclear, the trend of increased recalls and ongoing safety investigations related to factors like HPAI bird flu suggest a heightened risk environment. If the time frame is shortened, the ability for multiple recalls to materialize decreases; conversely, a longer time frame accommodates more opportunities for recalls to be reported.\n\nConsidering the current data and subquestion analyses, there is a balanced probability leaning towards the possibility of more than one recall occurring in December 2024, but with significant uncertainty due to the lack of specific indicators for that month.\n\n**Probability: 45%**",
