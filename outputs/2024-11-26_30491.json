    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nOn December 31, 2024, will exactly 4 US states have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-26\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as the number of US states, including Washington, D.C., in which fully rider-only ride-hailing trips operated by Waymo are available to the general public on December 31, 2024.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be Waymo's website, which as of early 2024 includes a [\"Where Can You Go?\"](https://waymo.com/whereyoucango/) page. Other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) may also be considered in the event of ambiguity or dispute.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n\"rider-only\" trip means one in which the only humans in the car are passengers and no human operates the vehicle for the duration of the trip.\n\"Available to the general public\" means that any member of the public is eligible to use the service without first joining a waitlist or having been granted use of the service as part of a limited testing or early access phase.\n\"United States\" means the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. Therefore the possible outcome range is 0-51.\nIn the event that Waymo's operating status in a given state is ambiguous or disputed, Metaculus admins will resolve the state's status based on the best available information indicating whether, in fact, its autonomous ride-hailing service is publicly available for ride-hailing on December 31, 2024.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThis question is part of the [Understanding AI Series with Timothy B Lee](https://www.metaculus.com/project/3055/) and was inspired by [this post](https://www.understandingai.org/p/new-data-shows-waymo-crashes-a-lot).\n\nWaymo, the Alphabet-owned self-driving technology company, has emerged as a pioneer in the development of autonomous vehicles. Since its inception as Google’s self-driving car project in 2009, Waymo’s vehicles have logged over 7 million miles of rider-only trips.\n\nAs of early 2024, Waymo operates its rider-only ride-hailing service in California (San Francisco and Los Angeles) and Arizona (Phoenix), and has announced plans to expand operations to Texas (Austin).\n\nIn late 2023, Waymo published a [report](https://waymo.com/blog/2023/12/waymo-significantly-outperforms-comparable-human-benchmarks-over-7-million/) claiming that its autonomous vehicles have achieved an 85% reduction in the rate of injury-causing compared to national rates for human-operated cars, highlighting the potential of self-driving cars to reduce crashes caused by human error.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether exactly 4 US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public by December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Operational Areas\nAs of the current date, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service, Waymo One, is available to the general public in the following states:\n- Arizona: Specifically in Phoenix and surrounding areas, including Scottsdale and parts of Metro Phoenix[3][5].\n- California: In San Francisco and now in Los Angeles[3][4].\n- Texas: Although the service is mentioned to be in a limited rollout, it is not yet fully available to the general public. Planned expansions target early 2025 for Texas[2].\n\n## Expansion Plans\nThere are no confirmed plans for Waymo to expand to a fourth state by the end of 2024. The current focus is on expanding services within the existing operational areas, such as the recent expansion in Los Angeles and the ongoing growth in Phoenix[3][4][5].\n\n## Forecast and Predictions\nThe Metaculus question on this topic indicates a low community prediction (14%) that exactly 4 US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available by December 31, 2024. This suggests that the community does not expect an additional state to be added by the end of the year[2].\n\nGiven this information, it is unlikely that exactly 4 US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public by December 31, 2024. The answer to the question is likely \"no,\" but it is not definitively confirmed without an official announcement from Waymo. However, based on current data and expansion plans, the probability of reaching four states by the end of 2024 appears low.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Waymo officially launched its rider-only ride-hailing service in California by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 2024, Waymo has officially launched its fully autonomous ride-hailing service, Waymo One, to the general public in Los Angeles, California. This service is now available to anyone in Los Angeles, marking a significant expansion beyond the initial limited group of passengers from a waiting list[3][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any reported delays or setbacks in Waymo's expansion to additional states as of December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any reported delays or setbacks in Waymo's expansion to additional states as of December 31, 2024. The sources discuss Waymo's successful funding round, its expansion plans, and its current operations, but they do not indicate any delays in these expansion efforts.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Waymo received all necessary regulatory approvals to operate its rider-only ride-hailing service in a fourth state by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of Waymo operating or seeking to operate its rider-only ride-hailing service in any state other than California. The sources discuss Waymo's operations and regulatory approvals specifically within California, including expansions in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Peninsula, but do not mention any other states.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available in any state outside of California, Arizona, and Texas by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service will be available in any state outside of California, Arizona, and Texas by December 31, 2024.\n\n- The sources mention operations and expansions in California, Arizona, and initial testing in Texas, but there is no mention of any other states[1][2][4].\n- Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Waymo officially launched its rider-only ride-hailing service in Texas by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Waymo has officially launched its rider-only ride-hailing service in Texas, specifically in Austin, by December 31, 2024.\n\nAs of October 3, 2024, Waymo began allowing members of the public to hail self-driving taxis in Austin, marking a significant step towards its commercial launch in the city. This service is available through the Waymo One app, with plans to transition to the Uber app in early 2025[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Waymo initiated any pilot programs or limited launches in states other than California, Arizona, and Texas by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of Waymo initiating pilot programs or limited launches in states other than California, Arizona, and the mentioned areas in those states by December 31, 2024. The sources discuss Waymo's operations and pilot programs primarily in California (San Francisco, Los Angeles), Arizona (Phoenix), and do not indicate any new initiatives in other states such as Texas or any other state.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Waymo announced plans to expand its rider-only ride-hailing service to any additional states by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no announcement of Waymo expanding its rider-only ride-hailing service to any additional states beyond those already mentioned (California, Arizona, and the planned expansion to Texas and Georgia, but not effective until 2025).\n\n- The sources mention expansions within existing cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin, as well as future plans to serve riders in Atlanta in 2025 through a partnership with Uber, but these do not include new states by December 31, 2024[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Waymo officially launched its rider-only ride-hailing service in Arizona by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Waymo has already begun testing its rider-only ride-hailing service on freeways in Phoenix, Arizona, as of January 2024. This testing includes providing rider-only trips to Waymo employees on freeways across Phoenix[1][2][3].\n\nWhile the sources do not specify the exact date by which the service will be fully launched to the public, they indicate that the service is already in the process of being expanded and tested. Given that the testing has started and the service has been operating in various capacities in Phoenix since 2022, it is reasonable to infer that the service will likely be officially available to the public by December 31, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the total number of US states with Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service exactly four by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, as of December 31, 2024, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service is available in the following states:\n\n- California (Los Angeles and San Francisco)[1][3][4]\n- Arizona (Phoenix)[1][3][5]\n- Texas (limited rollout in Austin, but not yet fully available to the general public as of the end of 2024)[1][4]\n\nThere are no indications that Waymo's service will be fully available to the general public in a fourth state by December 31, 2024. The expansions to Atlanta, Georgia, and further in Austin, Texas, are planned for early 2025[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service fully available to the general public in California, Arizona, and Texas by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the information regarding the availability of Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service in the specified states:\n\n- **California**: Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service, Waymo One, is fully available to the general public in Los Angeles as of November 2024[4].\n- **Arizona**: The service has been available in Phoenix, including to and from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, and has been expanded to include more areas in Phoenix[3][4].\n- **Texas**: The service is being tested in Austin, and while it is currently available to Waymo employees, it is planned to be opened to the general public later in 2024[2].\n\nGiven this information:\n- California: YES\n- Arizona: YES\n- Texas: While it is planned to be available to the public later in 2024, it is not yet confirmed to be fully available to the general public by December 31, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service is fully available to the general public in all three states by December 31, 2024, is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (due to the uncertainty about the exact timeline for Texas).",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**  \n5 weeks (from November 26, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) Outcome if nothing changed:**  \nCurrently, Waymo operates its rider-only ride-hailing service in three states: California, Arizona, and Texas (limited rollout in Austin). If there are no changes in expansion plans or unforeseen developments, the number of states with Waymo's service by December 31, 2024, would remain at three.\n\n**(c) Forecast with only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 1.25 weeks remaining, it's highly improbable for Waymo to launch its service in an additional state within such a short timeframe. The likelihood of increasing the count to four states in this period is virtually nonexistent.\n\n**(d) Forecast with 4x the time left:**  \nWith around 20 weeks, Waymo would have a more feasible window to expand its services to an additional state. Factors such as regulatory approvals, infrastructure setup, and testing phases would still pose challenges, but the extended timeframe would increase the probability of reaching four states.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nGiven the current operational footprint of Waymo in California and Arizona, with Texas in a limited rollout, the expansion to a fourth state by the end of 2024 faces significant hurdles. The planned expansions into other states, such as Georgia, are slated for early 2025, indicating that Waymo's strategic focus is on consolidating its presence in existing markets before venturing into new ones. Additionally, the Metaculus community's prediction of a 14% probability aligns with the assessment that reaching a fourth state within the remaining five weeks is unlikely. While unforeseen factors could influence this outcome, the available information suggests that maintaining operations in three states is the most probable scenario.\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
