    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Bitcoin dominance exceed 63.0% on any single day in November or December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-15\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before 5 January 2025, [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/bitcoin-dominance/) reports a Bitcoin dominance value of 63.1% or higher for any single date in November or December 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf CoinMarketCap is unavailable or does not report the relevant data between January 1 and January 5, 2025, this question will be **Annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Bitcoin (BTC) dominance](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/bitcoin-dominance/) is a metric used to measure the relative market share of Bitcoin in the overall cryptocurrency sector. It represents the percentage of Bitcoin's total market capitalisation compared to the total market capitalisation of all cryptocurrencies combined. BTC dominance has fluctuated over the years. It reached a low of 38.3% in 2022, but has been steadily rising since, achieving a local peak of 60.0% on November 13, 2024.\n\nThe rise could be attributed to multiple factors. The SEC's [approval](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-sec-gives-green-light-options-listing-spot-bitcoin-etfs-nyse-2024-10-18/) of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024 increased accessibility for mainstream investors, drawing significant capital into BTC. Donald Trump's re-election might have further driven the rise in BTC dominance as, according to [the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c89v1w5lxxqo):\n\n> In the run-up to the election Trump said he would create a strategic bitcoin stockpile and appoint digital asset-friendly financial regulators - spurring expectations that he would strip back regulations on the crypto industry.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Bitcoin dominance will exceed 63.0% on any single day in November or December 2024, here are some key points and trends that can inform this prediction:\n\n## Current Bitcoin Dominance\nAs of November 2024, Bitcoin dominance has already surged to the 60% threshold, indicating strong investor confidence in Bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies[4].\n\n## Historical and Technical Analysis\nAnalyst Benjamin Cowen has conducted detailed technical analyses suggesting that Bitcoin dominance could reach 60% by December 2024, based on historical patterns, Fibonacci retracement levels, and macroeconomic factors. He also notes that Bitcoin dominance has been trending higher since late 2022 and has maintained its position above key moving averages[2].\n\n## Seasonality and Market Dynamics\nHistorically, Bitcoin dominance faces headwinds during the summer months but has shown less seasonal weakness in 2024. Additionally, the period from late Q3 into Q4 has historically been strong for Bitcoin dominance, which could support a further increase[2].\n\n## Monetary Policy Influence\nRestrictive monetary policy tends to favor Bitcoin over altcoins, which could continue to support higher Bitcoin dominance. The expectation of a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September 2024 could further bolster Bitcoin dominance[2].\n\n## Recent Market Trends\nBitcoin's market dominance has been rising, partly due to significant price rallies and increasing investor interest. However, some analysts suggest that the current high level of dominance might be nearing its peak, with potential for a reversal in the near term[4].\n\n## Cyclical View\nHistorical patterns show that altcoin dominance often surges after a drop in Bitcoin dominance, typically every 8 months following the Bitcoin Halving event. Since we are currently in the 7th month since the last halving, there is a possibility of an altseason soon, which could impact Bitcoin dominance[4].\n\nGiven these points, while there is a strong case for Bitcoin dominance to remain high or even increase further due to favorable market conditions and historical trends, it is not clear whether it will specifically exceed 63.0% on any single day in November or December 2024. The current dominance is already at 60%, and while there are arguments for further increases, there are also considerations that suggest this level might be nearing its peak.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historical data shows that Bitcoin dominance can fluctuate significantly based on market sentiment, monetary policy, and seasonal factors.\n- The current high dominance level is not unprecedented but is at a critical juncture where it could either continue to rise or experience a pullback.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The period from late Q3 into Q4 is historically strong for Bitcoin dominance, suggesting that any significant movement could occur within the next few weeks.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- Monetary policy expectations, particularly the potential for a rate cut, and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs have contributed to the current high dominance level.\n\nIn summary, while the conditions are favorable for high Bitcoin dominance, the specific threshold of 63.0% is not guaranteed and depends on various market and economic factors. Therefore, the answer to whether Bitcoin dominance will exceed 63.0% on any single day in November or December 2024 is not immediately clear.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bitcoin dominance exceeded 63% at any point since January 2018?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Bitcoin dominance has not exceeded 63% since January 2018, according to the latest data available.\n\n- The highest level of Bitcoin dominance mentioned in the sources is around 61.39% as of November 2024[5][3].\n- There is no indication in the sources that Bitcoin dominance has surpassed 63% at any point since January 2018.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the period from November to December historically see an increase in Bitcoin dominance?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific historical data or trend analysis that indicates a consistent increase in Bitcoin dominance during the period from November to December.\n\n- The sources discuss Bitcoin dominance in various contexts, including its recent increases and historical fluctuations, but they do not provide a specific analysis of the November to December period[2][4][5].\n- Therefore, it is unclear whether this period historically sees an increase in Bitcoin dominance.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bitcoin dominance typically increased in the year following a Bitcoin halving event?\nANSWER: No, Bitcoin dominance has not typically increased in the year following a Bitcoin halving event. Instead, historical data suggests that after a Bitcoin halving, Bitcoin dominance often decreases as capital flows from Bitcoin to altcoins.\n\n- After the second and third Bitcoin halvings, Bitcoin dominance declined significantly, with a 63% and 42% drop, respectively, as capital shifted towards altcoins[5].\n- The period following a Bitcoin halving typically sees a rally in the altcoin market, indicating a decrease in Bitcoin dominance as investors diversify their portfolios and seek higher returns in altcoins[3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have institutional investments significantly increased Bitcoin dominance in the past?\nANSWER: Yes, institutional investments have significantly contributed to the increase in Bitcoin dominance in the past.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the impact of institutional investments on Bitcoin's market position:\n- Institutional interest and investment from hedge funds, pension funds, and publicly traded companies have bolstered Bitcoin’s market dominance, driving it to its highest level since 2021[1][2][5].\n- The influx of institutional capital, particularly through ETFs such as BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, has favored Bitcoin due to its perceived stability and established market presence[1][2][5].\n- Increased regulatory clarity and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs have also encouraged more substantial institutional investments, further enhancing Bitcoin’s dominance[1][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bitcoin dominance shown a significant upward trend between 2021 and October 2023?\nANSWER: No, the sources indicate that Bitcoin's dominance did not show a significant upward trend continuously from 2021 to October 2023. Here are the key points:\n\n- Bitcoin's dominance peaked in early 2021, reaching over 70%[4].\n- After the 2021 peak, Bitcoin's dominance declined to around 60% by 2023[4].\n- It was only in recent months (around October 2023 and later) that Bitcoin's dominance surged again to its highest levels since 2021, reaching around 61-65%[1][3][5].\n\nThis indicates that while there was a significant increase in dominance in the latter part of 2023, it was not a continuous upward trend from 2021 to October 2023.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have regulatory approvals like Bitcoin ETFs historically led to substantial increases in Bitcoin dominance?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not offer historical data or specific examples that directly link regulatory approvals of Bitcoin ETFs to substantial increases in Bitcoin dominance. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is seen as a significant milestone in the legitimacy and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin, potentially attracting new investors and increasing market capitalization[2][4][5].\n- The immediate market reaction to the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 included volatility and a temporary price drop, rather than an immediate substantial increase in price or dominance[1][4][5].\n- There is no explicit mention of how these approvals have historically affected Bitcoin's dominance in the cryptocurrency market.\n\nGiven this, the answer to whether regulatory approvals like Bitcoin ETFs have historically led to substantial increases in Bitcoin dominance is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does restrictive monetary policy favor an increase in Bitcoin dominance over altcoins?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, restrictive monetary policy does not directly favor an increase in Bitcoin dominance over altcoins in the way that looser monetary policy does.\n\n- Looser monetary policy, such as quantitative easing, tends to benefit Bitcoin by adding liquidity to the financial system, which can increase its dominance[5].\n- Restrictive monetary policy, on the other hand, is associated with tighter financial conditions and higher interest rates, which can lead to a risk-off sentiment. While this might make Bitcoin more attractive as a safe-haven asset, the sources do not explicitly state that restrictive monetary policy specifically favors an increase in Bitcoin dominance over altcoins. Instead, they highlight that fear and risk-off sentiment can increase Bitcoin's dominance, but this is more about market sentiment rather than the direct effect of restrictive monetary policy[5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** because the sources do not provide a clear link between restrictive monetary policy and an increase in Bitcoin dominance specifically over altcoins.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there historical evidence of Bitcoin dominance increasing during periods of economic uncertainty?\nANSWER: Yes, there is historical evidence suggesting that Bitcoin dominance increases during periods of economic uncertainty.\n\n- Studies have shown that during times of economic uncertainty or market downtrends, investors tend to favor Bitcoin as a safer haven, leading to an increase in Bitcoin dominance. For example, high Bitcoin dominance ratios are often seen during periods of high uncertainty or downtrends, as investors shift their capital to Bitcoin, making it more stable or bullish compared to altcoins[3].\n\n- During economic uncertainties, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, financial crises, or geopolitical risks, Bitcoin has been regarded as a hedge against traditional financial systems, resulting in increased demand and higher dominance[5].\n\n- The relationship between Bitcoin dominance and market cycles indicates that in bear cycles or periods of uncertainty, Bitcoin's dominance increases as investors seek safer assets[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a historical pattern of Bitcoin dominance increasing after U.S. presidential elections?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear historical pattern established that shows Bitcoin dominance consistently increasing after U.S. presidential elections. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Current Election Impact**: The sources indicate that the 2024 U.S. presidential election has had a significant impact on Bitcoin prices, particularly with Donald Trump's victory leading to a rally and new record highs for Bitcoin. However, this is specific to the 2024 election and does not establish a historical pattern[4][5].\n\n2. **Regulatory Uncertainty and Market Reaction**: The impact of U.S. presidential elections on the cryptocurrency market is largely driven by regulatory uncertainty and the differing policy stances of the candidates. This can lead to volatility and market reactions, but it does not necessarily mean a consistent increase in Bitcoin dominance after every election[5].\n\n3. **Lack of Historical Data**: The sources do not provide a comprehensive historical analysis of Bitcoin's performance following previous U.S. presidential elections. They focus more on the current and anticipated impacts rather than historical trends.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is **UNCLEAR** whether there is a historical pattern of Bitcoin dominance increasing after U.S. presidential elections.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major altcoins currently facing regulatory challenges that could decrease their market share?\nANSWER: Yes, major altcoins and the broader cryptocurrency market, including altcoins, are currently facing significant regulatory challenges that could impact their market share.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the increasing regulatory scrutiny on various aspects of the cryptocurrency market, including altcoins and other crypto assets:\n\n- Regulatory agencies such as the SEC and CFTC in the U.S. are actively pursuing enforcement actions against crypto projects, including DeFi projects, for alleged violations of securities and commodities laws[1][3][4].\n- The focus on stablecoins, which are often closely tied to the broader crypto market, includes new regulatory requirements aimed at managing financial crime risks, ensuring adequate reserves, and protecting holders' interests. These regulations are being implemented in various jurisdictions, including the EU, Singapore, and the UK[1][3][5].\n- The lack of clear regulatory frameworks, particularly in the U.S., creates uncertainty and can hinder innovation and market stability. This regulatory uncertainty can affect the entire crypto market, including major altcoins[2][3][4].\n\nThese regulatory challenges can lead to increased compliance costs, potential legal issues, and a more complex operating environment, all of which could decrease the market share of major altcoins if they are not able to adapt or comply with the new regulations.",
