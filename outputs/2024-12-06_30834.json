    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the closing price of CAC 40 be less than 7,200 on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the close price of the CAC 40 for December 31, 2024 according to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EFCHI/history/) is <7,400.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- If Yahoo Finance is unavailable, alternative credible sources may be used.\r\n- Euronext Paris [is expected](https://www.tradinghours.com/markets/euronext-paris) to open on December 31, 2024. Nonetheless, if neither Yahoo Finance nor other credible sources published a number for that date, the close price for December 30, 2024 will be used.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe CAC 40 is a benchmark French stock market index, representing a capitalisation-weighted measure of the 40 most significant stocks among the 100 largest market caps on the Euronext Paris. [Politico reports](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-prime-minister-michel-barnier-is-facing-the-chop-what-happens-next-crisis-emmanuel-macron/) that markets have been unsettled by the prospect of the collapse of the French PM, with the CAC 40, falling by 0.2% on December 2, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the CAC 40 closing price being less than 7,200 on December 31, 2024, here are some key points from the available forecasts:\n\n## Forecasted Values for December 2024\n- According to the forecast on 30rates.com, the CAC 40 is expected to start December 2024 at 7,233, with a maximum value of 8,005, a minimum value of 6,957, and an average value of 7,419. The forecasted closing price at the end of December is 7,481, which is above 7,200[1].\n- On coinpriceforecast.com, various forecasts predict the CAC 40 to end 2024 at values ranging from 7,677 to 8,901, all of which are above 7,200[2].\n- Longforecast.com predicts the CAC 40 to end December 2024 at 8,205, with a minimum value for the month of 7,631, again above 7,200[3].\n\n## Historical and Average Values\n- The forecasts consistently indicate that the average and predicted closing values for December 2024 are significantly higher than 7,200.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the forecasts from multiple sources, it is highly unlikely that the closing price of the CAC 40 will be less than 7,200 on December 31, 2024. All forecasts suggest values well above this threshold.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The forecasts provide a clear consensus that the CAC 40 will close 2024 at a value higher than 7,200.\n- There is no indication from these sources that would suggest a sudden and significant drop to below 7,200 by the end of December.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The question pertains to a specific date (December 31, 2024), and all forecasts cover this period, providing a clear outlook.\n\nBased on this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the closing price of the CAC 40 on December 31, 2024, will likely be above 7,200.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the French Prime Minister still in office as of December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nAs of December 6, 2024, the French Prime Minister, Michel Barnier, is no longer in office. He faced a no-confidence vote and his government was defeated on December 4, 2024, leading to his resignation[1][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the latest closing price of the CAC 40 above 7,200?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe latest closing price of the CAC 40 is above 7,200. As of the latest data, the CAC 40 closed at 7,243[3] or around 7,235.12 EUR[4], both of which are above the 7,200 mark.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Euronext Paris expected to operate normally on December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: No, Euronext Paris is not expected to operate normally on December 31, 2024. The market will observe a half-day trading schedule, with various instruments closing early. Specifically, on December 31, 2024, the Euronext Derivatives markets will close early, and the Euronext Paris Cash Markets will also have half-day trading, with all instruments closing by 14:05 CET[2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major economic policy changes in France since December 2, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication of any major economic policy changes in France specifically since December 2, 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss economic forecasts, fiscal policies, and the impact of the government's collapse, but they do not mention any new major economic policy changes implemented after December 2, 2024[2][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major political upheavals in France since December 2, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nSince December 2, 2024, there have been significant political upheavals in France. On December 4, 2024, the French parliament voted to oust Prime Minister Michel Barnier through a no-confidence vote, primarily due to his proposed budget and the use of Article 49.3 of the Constitution to push through the 2025 social security budget plan without a parliamentary vote[2][3][5]. This event marked the collapse of Barnier's government, which had been in office for less than three months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have key companies in the CAC 40 experienced significant stock declines in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about significant stock declines for key companies in the CAC 40 index in November 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss stock market performance and significant declines, but these are primarily referenced in the context of 2023, not November 2024[2][4].\n- The most recent updates provided are from December 2024, which mention market performance and events but do not specify significant declines for key companies in November 2024[1][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the CAC 40 closed below 7,200 at any time in the past three months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence that the CAC 40 has come close to but not necessarily closed below the 7,200 level in the past three months.\n\n- From Trading Economics, it is mentioned that the CAC 40 has been in a range where it has found solid support at around 7,200, but there is no specific mention of it closing below this level[1].\n- On TradingView, it is noted that the CAC 40 reached a new 3-month low at 7,205.63, which is above the 7,200 level[4].\n\nGiven this information, it appears that the CAC 40 has not closed below 7,200 in the past three months.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the overall European stock market trend positive as of December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the overall trend of the European stock market as of December 6, 2024, appears to be positive. Here are the key points:\n\n- The main stock market index in the Euro Area (EU50) has increased by 9.41% since the beginning of 2024[2].\n- Major global stock indices, including those in Europe, have generally closed on the up, with gains ranging from 5% to 18%, although the CAC 40 slipped 0.8%[1].\n- European equities have remained resilient and avoided significant declines despite some economic slowdown, with the ECB's rate-cutting cycle potentially supporting the market[4].\n- The European equity market is trading at a slight discount to fair value estimates, and many stocks are considered undervalued, presenting investment opportunities[3].\n\nTherefore, the overall trend is positive.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have financial forecasts from multiple reputable sources predicted the CAC 40 to close above 7,200 on December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, here are the forecasts for the CAC 40 index at the end of December 2024:\n\n- From the first source, the forecast for December 2024 indicates that the CAC 40 could start the month at 7233, with a maximum value of 8005 and a minimum value of 6957. The forecasted value at the end of the month is 7481, which is above 7200 but does not specify a closing value exactly on December 31[1].\n- The third source provides a similar forecast, with the CAC 40 starting December 2024 at 8156, and the forecasted value at the end of the month being 8205. This also suggests the index will be above 7200[3].\n\nGiven these forecasts, it is clear that multiple sources predict the CAC 40 to be above 7200 by the end of December 2024, although they do not specifically state the closing value on December 31.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant economic indicators suggesting a downturn for the French economy in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are several indicators and forecasts that suggest a potential downturn or weak growth for the French economy in the near term, including December 2024:\n\n1. **GDP Growth Projections**: The ING Think report predicts that France's GDP could contract by 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024, following the 0.4% rise in the third quarter, which was boosted by the Olympic Games[3].\n\n2. **Business Climate**: The business climate in France has darkened, with sentiment falling in most sectors, including services, wholesale and retail trade, and construction. This suggests weak growth over the coming quarters[3].\n\n3. **Leading Economic Index (LEI)**: Although the LEI for France improved slightly in August, the overall trend over the past year indicates headwinds ahead, suggesting moderate growth in the near term but with potential challenges[4].\n\n4. **Economic Forecasts**: The European Commission and other sources forecast a moderation in GDP growth for France in 2024 and 2025, with various factors such as fiscal adjustment, weak demand, and geopolitical uncertainties contributing to this outlook[2][4].\n\nGiven these points, there are significant economic indicators suggesting a potential downturn or at least very sluggish growth for the French economy in December 2024.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:** 25 days\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions remain constant, the CAC 40 is expected to close above 7,200 on December 31, 2024. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 6 days remaining, the probability of the CAC 40 closing below 7,200 would remain very low. Short-term fluctuations are possible, but no significant downward trend is evident that would push the index below this threshold.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith around 100 days remaining, there is ample time for market conditions to evolve. However, given the strong consensus among forecasts predicting the CAC 40 to remain above 7,200, the probability of a decline below this level would still be minimal. Extended time allows for more data and potential mitigating factors, but no indicators suggest a significant downturn.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe current forecasts from multiple reputable sources consistently predict the CAC 40 closing above 7,200 by the end of December 2024. The latest closing prices are already above this threshold, and there is no substantial evidence suggesting a sudden or significant market downturn that would drive the index below 7,200 within the remaining 25 days. While political instability, such as the resignation of the French Prime Minister, introduces some uncertainty, the overall market sentiment and economic indicators remain positive. Additionally, the lack of major economic policy changes and the resilience of European stock markets further support the likelihood of the CAC 40 maintaining its position above 7,200.\n\n**Probability:** 5%",
