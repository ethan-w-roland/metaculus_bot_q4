    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the International Criminal Court bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu before 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve Yes if, before January 1, 2025, the International Criminal Court brings charges against Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nPer the [Rome Statute](https://www.icc-cpi.int/sites/default/files/RS-Eng.pdf)—the founding statute of the ICC—the court may bring charges within the following [categories](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/how-the-court-works):\n\n- Genocide\n- Crimes against humanity\n- War crimes\n- Crimes of aggression\n- Offences against the administration of justice\n\nThe ICC announcing either an indictment, summons, or an arrest warrant is sufficient for a Yes resolution.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nOn October 7th, 2023, Palestinians militants launched rockets at Israel and 3,000 militants breached the Gaza-Israel border. More than 1,000 Israelis were killed in Kibbutzims, military bases, and at a [music festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re%27im_music_festival_massacre), and over 200 hostages were abducted and taken into the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe next day on October 8th, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared war. Israel responded by bombing Gaza dropping 6,000 bombs in the first 6 days, and then a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip in late October. \n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has [accused both sides of war crimes](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-rights-chief-says-war-crimes-committed-both-sides-israel-hamas-conflict-2023-11-08/#:~:text=Israel%20has%20bombarded%20Gaza%20unrelentingly,including%20many%20women%20and%20children.).\n\n>CAIRO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Wednesday war crimes had been committed by both Israel and Hamas in the conflict that erupted just over a month ago.\n\n>\"The atrocities perpetrated by Palestinian armed groups on 7 October were heinous, they were war crimes - as is the continued holding of hostages,\" Volker Turk said at the Rafah crossing in Egypt on the border with Gaza.\n\n>\"The collective punishment by Israel of Palestinian civilians is also a war crime, as is unlawful forcible evacuation of civilians,\" he added.\n\nThe [International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/), headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands, is an independent judicial institution empowered to prosecute individuals for international crimes, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. It is distinct from the United Nations and does not possess universal jurisdiction, relying instead on the ratification of the [Rome Statute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Statute) by individual states, which confers the Court's jurisdiction. Israel is not a member state of the ICC, but the ICC's top prosecutor has [claimed jurisdiction](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-attack-would-fall-under-jurisdiction-war-crimes-court-prosecutor-2023-10-12/#:~:text=THE%20HAGUE%2C%20Netherlands%2C%20Oct%2012,prosecutor%20told%20Reuters%20on%20Thursday.) over any war crimes carrier out in the Gaza conflict, [writing](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/10/law-israel-hamas-international-criminal-court-icc)\n\n> My office has ongoing jurisdiction in relation to any alleged crimes committed on the territory of the State of Palestine by any party. This includes jurisdiction over current events in Gaza and in the West Bank.\n\n> Israel has clear obligations in relation to its war with Hamas: not just moral obligations, but legal obligations that it has to comply with the laws of armed conflict. These laws are clearly outlined in the Rome statute and the Geneva conventions.\n\nOn November 16, 2023, South Africa [referred Israel to the ICC](https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/south-africa-refers-israel-icc-gaza-attacks-pressure-104937581). South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said:\n\n> “As South Africa we have accordingly, together with many other countries across the world, referred this whole Israeli government action to the International Criminal Court,\" Ramaphosa said Wednesday during a state visit to Qatar.\n\n> “We have put through a referral because we believe that war crimes are being committed there. And of course we do not condone the actions that were taken by Hamas earlier, but similarly we condemn the actions that are currently underway and believe that they warrant an investigation by the ICC,” he added.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the International Criminal Court (ICC) will bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu before 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Status of ICC Proceedings\nThe ICC Prosecutor, Karim Khan, has already submitted applications for arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip. However, these applications are still under review by the ICC judges, and no warrants have been issued yet.\n\n## Timeline for ICC Decisions\nThe process of reviewing evidence and deciding whether to issue arrest warrants can take several months. Given that the applications were submitted in May 2024, it is possible but not guaranteed that a decision will be made before the end of 2024.\n\n## Political and Diplomatic Context\nThe ICC's actions are subject to significant political and diplomatic pressure. The Israeli government, along with some international allies, has strongly opposed the ICC's investigation and potential charges. This opposition could influence the timing and outcome of the ICC's decisions, although the ICC has emphasized its independence and impartiality.\n\n## Historical Precedents\nThe ICC has never indicted a Western official before, which adds a layer of complexity and potential delay to the process. The court's previous experiences with high-profile cases suggest that the issuance of arrest warrants and subsequent legal proceedings can be lengthy.\n\nGiven these factors, while it is possible that the ICC could bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu before 2025, it is not certain. The decision depends on the ICC judges' review process, which could extend into 2025 or beyond.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The ICC has a history of taking significant time to issue warrants and conduct trials.\n- High-profile cases involving political leaders are particularly complex and often face significant delays and political pressures.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The review process for the applications submitted in May 2024 could take several months.\n- If warrants are issued, the subsequent legal proceedings would likely extend well beyond 2024.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The ongoing conflict in Gaza and the political tensions surrounding the ICC's investigation add to the complexity and potential delays.\n\nIn summary, while the ICC has initiated the process for potential charges, the timing of any decision remains uncertain and could extend into 2025 or later.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Israel a member state of the International Criminal Court?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nIsrael is not a member state of the International Criminal Court. Although Israel signed the Rome Statute on December 31, 2000, it did not ratify it.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the ICC Prosecutor publicly indicated an intention to bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe ICC Prosecutor, Karim Khan, has publicly indicated his intention to bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu. On May 20, Khan sought arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and three Hamas leaders on war crimes charges.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the ICC Prosecutor opened an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by Israel in the recent Gaza conflict?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe ICC Prosecutor, Karim Khan, has indeed opened an investigation into alleged war crimes committed in the context of the recent Gaza conflict. The investigation includes charges against Israeli officials, such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, for crimes including starvation as a method of war, wilfully causing great suffering, and intentional attacks against a civilian population.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the ICC claimed jurisdiction over alleged war crimes committed in the Gaza Strip?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe ICC has indeed claimed jurisdiction over alleged war crimes committed in the Gaza Strip. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- On 5 February 2021, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber I decided that the Court's territorial jurisdiction in the Situation in Palestine extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, which includes the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.\n- The Prosecutor has confirmed that the investigation encompasses conduct that may amount to Rome Statute crimes committed since 13 June 2014 in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the International Criminal Court ever brought charges against a sitting head of government before?\nANSWER: YES, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has brought charges against a sitting head of government before. The most notable examples include:\n\n- In 2009, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, making him the first sitting president to be indicted by the ICC.\n- In 2023, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin, charging him with the war crime of unlawfully deporting children from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any state referred Israel or Benjamin Netanyahu to the ICC for investigation?\nANSWER: No state has directly referred Israel or Benjamin Netanyahu to the ICC for investigation. However, the State of Palestine, which is recognized as a non-member observer state by the United Nations, has referred the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory to the ICC.\n\nOn 22 May 2018, the State of Palestine referred the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory since 13 June 2014 to the ICC Prosecutor, which led to the opening of an investigation.\n\nAdditionally, other countries such as South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros, and Djibouti, and later Chile and Mexico, have submitted referrals to the Prosecutor in support of the ongoing investigation into the situation in Palestine, but these are not direct referrals against Israel or Netanyahu specifically.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been previous instances where the ICC charged individuals from non-member states?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been instances where the ICC has charged or considered charging individuals from non-member states under specific conditions.\n\n- The ICC can exercise jurisdiction over individuals from non-member states if the alleged offenses took place on the territory of a member state, if the non-member state accepts the court’s jurisdiction, or with the authorization of the UN Security Council.\n- For example, the ICC has jurisdiction over US citizens if they commit crimes on the territory of an ICC member state, such as Afghanistan, Poland, Lithuania, or Romania.\n- Additionally, the ICC can investigate and prosecute individuals from non-member states if the UN Security Council refers the case to the ICC, as seen in cases involving Libya and Sudan.\n\nThese provisions allow the ICC to extend its jurisdiction beyond its member states under certain circumstances.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the ICC typically issue arrest warrants or indictments within two months after opening an investigation?\nANSWER: No, the ICC does not typically issue arrest warrants or indictments within two months after opening an investigation.\n\nThe process of issuing arrest warrants involves several steps, including the Prosecutor's application, the Pre-Trial Chamber's review, and the consideration of various factors such as the necessity of the warrant to ensure the person's appearance or to prevent obstruction of the investigation. Here are some key points:\n\n- The Prosecutor's announcement to seek arrest warrants is just the beginning of a lengthy process.\n- The Pre-Trial Chamber must assess whether there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe that the suspects have committed a crime within the Court's jurisdiction, which can take several weeks to almost a year.\n- Historically, the time taken to secure a decision on arrest warrants has varied significantly, ranging from several weeks to almost a year.\n\nTherefore, the timeframe for issuing arrest warrants is not as short as two months after the investigation is opened, but rather it can be a more extended process.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant international pressure urging the ICC to bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu?\nANSWER: The situation is complex, and the sources indicate both support and opposition to the ICC's actions, but they do not clearly show significant international pressure specifically urging the ICC to bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n- There are strong reactions from various parties, including criticism and support. For example, human rights organizations have applauded the ICC's efforts to hold Israeli leaders accountable, but there is also significant opposition from Israel, the US, and other allies.\n- The US and some of its lawmakers have threatened sanctions and other measures against the ICC if it proceeds with the arrest warrants, which can be seen as pressure against the ICC rather than in favor of bringing charges.\n- Some experts and commentators support the ICC's actions as a necessary step for accountability, but this does not constitute widespread international pressure specifically urging the ICC to bring charges against Netanyahu.\n\nGiven this context, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there legal or procedural obstacles that would prevent the ICC from bringing charges against Benjamin Netanyahu before 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several factors and potential obstacles, but they do not necessarily prevent the ICC from bringing charges against Benjamin Netanyahu before 2025. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Jurisdiction and Legal Basis\nThe ICC has the jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other atrocity crimes, as the State of Palestine has accepted the ICC’s jurisdiction over such crimes in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank since June 13, 2014.\n\n## Political and Diplomatic Pressure\nThere are significant political and diplomatic pressures and threats against the ICC, including from Israel and the U.S., which could attempt to undermine the court's proceedings. However, these do not constitute legal obstacles but rather political challenges.\n\n## Procedural Steps\nThe ICC Chief Prosecutor, Karim Khan, has already applied for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and other officials, which is a procedural step towards potential charges. The court's judges must approve these warrants, but this process does not inherently delay the proceedings beyond 2025.\n\n## Potential Delays\nWhile there could be delays due to various factors, including legal challenges and the complexity of the cases, there is no clear indication that these would necessarily prevent charges from being brought before 2025.\n\nIn summary, while there are political, diplomatic, and procedural complexities, there are no clear legal or procedural obstacles that would categorically prevent the ICC from bringing charges against Benjamin Netanyahu before 2025.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nApproximately **56 days**, from November 6, 2024, to December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, the International Criminal Court (ICC) would **not** bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu before January 1, 2025. The outcome would be **\"No\"**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith roughly **14 days** remaining, the likelihood of the ICC bringing charges would be even **lower**, given the procedural timelines required for such actions.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **8 months** (4 times the current time frame) until the deadline, extending the period to around **July 2025**, the probability of charges being brought would **increase modestly** but would still be **limited** due to the ICC's lengthy processes.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the limited time frame of less than **two months** until January 1, 2025, it is **highly unlikely** that the ICC will bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu within this period. Several factors contribute to this assessment:\n\n1. **ICC Procedural Timelines:**\n   - The ICC's processes for investigating, reviewing evidence, and issuing arrest warrants or indictments are inherently **lengthy**. Historical precedents show that these steps can take **months to years** to reach fruition.\n   - For instance, the time from the initiation of an investigation to the issuance of arrest warrants in previous high-profile cases often extends beyond a year.\n\n2. **Current Status of Investigations:**\n   - As of November 6, 2024, while the ICC Prosecutor has opened investigations into alleged war crimes in the Gaza conflict and has expressed intent to investigate individuals on all sides, there have been **no official indictments or arrest warrants** issued against Benjamin Netanyahu.\n   - The Prosecutor's applications for arrest warrants, if any, are still under review by the ICC judges, a process that lacks a specific timeline but is unlikely to conclude within two months.\n\n3. **Legal and Procedural Complexities:**\n   - Issuing charges against a **sitting head of government** from a non-member state involves significant legal hurdles and diplomatic sensitivities.\n   - Although the ICC has claimed jurisdiction over the Palestinian territories and has previously indicted leaders from non-member states (e.g., Sudan's Omar al-Bashir), such actions are **exceptional** and typically require extended deliberation.\n\n4. **Political and Diplomatic Pressures:**\n   - There is substantial **political opposition** to the ICC’s investigations from Israel and allied nations, which may influence the pace and timing of any potential charges.\n   - Diplomatic efforts and international relations considerations often **slow down judicial processes** in cases involving high-ranking officials.\n\n5. **Time Constraints:**\n   - With only **56 days** remaining, the practicalities of completing the necessary legal procedures make the issuance of charges within this period **improbable**.\n   - Even if the ICC expedited its processes, it's unlikely that all requisite steps—reviewing evidence, judicial approvals, and public announcements—could be completed before the deadline.\n\n6. **Historical Base Rates:**\n   - Historically, the ICC has not moved rapidly in similar situations. The time between the opening of an investigation and the issuing of charges often exceeds the current time frame remaining before January 1, 2025.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the **limited time** available, the **procedural length** of ICC processes, and the **complexities** involved in bringing charges against a sitting head of government, the probability that the ICC will bring charges against Benjamin Netanyahu before **January 1, 2025**, is **very low**.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
