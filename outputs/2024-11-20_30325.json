    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of Kraven the Hunter, scheduled to open December 13, 2024, exceed $20,000,000?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-20\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the domestic box office for the opening weekend of Kraven the Hunter according to the tracking page on [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt8790086/?ref_=bo_se_r_1) exceeds USD $20,000,000.00. If the number is less than or equal to that, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf BoxOfficeMojo fails to report the number before January 1, 2025, other credible sources may be considered. If the film is not released before January 1, 2025, the question will be **annulled**. This question resolves based on the figures reported when they are accessed by Metaculus Admins, and further revisions will not be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [BoxOfficeTheory](https://boxofficetheory.com/5-week-tracking-forecasts-kraven-the-hunter-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-and-a-big-moana-2-update/), a movie forecasting company, Kraven the Hunter is expected to have an opening weekend of $20 million. Box Office Mojo generally [defines](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-mojo-by-imdbpro-faq/GCWTV4MQKGWRAUAP#domesticinternational) \"domestic\" as gross box-office revenue from North America (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico). According to the [Box Office by IMDbPro Glossary](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-by-imdbpro-glossary/GN8HA87MT4597FSW?ref_=mojo_ftr_glossary#boxofficetracking):\n>Box office tracking refers to theatrical box office earnings. Additional sources of revenue, such as home entertainment sales and rentals, television rights, product placement fees, etc. are not included.\n\n>Gross refers to gross earnings in U.S. dollars. On average, a movie's distributor receives a little more than half of the final gross (often referred to as the \"rentals\") with the remainder going to the exhibitor (i.e. movie theater). The money split varies from movie to movie, but, generally, the contract favors the distributor in early weeks and shifts to the exhibitor later on.\n\n>Weekend box office charts show gross receipts for a given weekend, which is Friday through Sunday unless otherwise noted. Studio estimates for the weekend are reported on Sunday mornings, generally between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Pacific Time and reflect estimated Friday and Saturday box office receipts plus a projection for Sunday.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of *Kraven the Hunter* will exceed $20 million, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Box Office Predictions\n- Early forecasts suggest that *Kraven the Hunter* might have a modest opening. One source predicts the domestic opening weekend to be between $16 million and $40 million, but leans towards the lower end of this range[5|.\n- Another source indicates that early forecasts are pointing to an opening weekend of $30 to $40 million, although this is considered uncertain and could be influenced by marketing efforts[4].\n\n## Competition and Release Date\n- *Kraven the Hunter* is scheduled to release on December 13, 2024, which places it in a competitive holiday season. It will be competing with other significant releases such as *The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*, *Mufasa: The Lion King*, and *Sonic the Hedgehog 3* in the following weeks[1][3].\n\n## Rating and Audience\n- The film is rated R, which could affect its box office performance during the holiday season when family-friendly films are more popular. However, the R-rating might attract older male audiences and comic book fans[1][5].\n\n## Marketing and Word-of-Mouth\n- The effectiveness of marketing and word-of-mouth will be crucial. While there has been some concern about the lack of marketing so far, positive word-of-mouth could help the film perform better in subsequent weekends[1][4].\n\n## Cast and Crew\n- The film has a talented cast, including Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ariana DeBose, and Russell Crowe, and is directed by J.C. Chandor, which could contribute to its appeal and potential success[1][4].\n\nGiven these factors, while there is some uncertainty, the current forecasts suggest that the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of *Kraven the Hunter* might be around or slightly above $20 million, but it is not a guarantee.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Previous films in the Sony Spider-Man Universe (SSU) have had varied success. For example, *Venom 3* had a disappointing opening but held up well in subsequent weekends. However, *Kraven the Hunter* faces different competition and market conditions[1][2].\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The film's performance will become clearer as it approaches its release date and as more detailed box office tracking data becomes available.\n\nIn summary, while the forecasts indicate a possibility of exceeding $20 million, it is not a clear-cut prediction due to the various factors at play, including competition, marketing, and audience reception.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Will Kraven the Hunter be released on December 13, 2024?\nANSWER: YES, *Kraven the Hunter* is scheduled to be released on December 13, 2024, as confirmed by multiple sources[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the director of Kraven the Hunter previously directed commercially successful films?\nANSWER: The provided source does not mention the director of 'Kraven: The Hunter' or their previous work, so it is unclear whether the director has previously directed commercially successful films.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kraven the Hunter received positive reviews from early critics?\nANSWER: The information on the early critical reception of *Kraven the Hunter* is mixed and not entirely clear from the sources provided.\n\n- An early screening of the movie generated a positive reception, with the film described as \"a pretty solid film\" according to industry insider Big Screen Leaks[4].\n- However, this positive early reaction has not universally convinced fans, with some expressing skepticism based on the mixed reception of previous Sony-Marvel films[4].\n\nThere is no comprehensive review from established critics at this stage, only early test screening feedback and mixed fan reactions. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Will Kraven the Hunter be competing with other major film releases during its opening weekend?\nANSWER: To determine if \"Kraven the Hunter\" will be competing with other major film releases during its opening weekend, we need to consider the release date and the typical release schedules of major films.\n\n\"Kraven the Hunter\" is set to be released on December 13, 2024[1][3][5].\n\nWhile the sources provided do not specify other major film releases scheduled for the same weekend, the release date in mid-December is a time when several films often compete for holiday season audiences. However, without specific information on other major releases scheduled for the same weekend, we cannot definitively say there will be direct competition.\n\nGiven the lack of detailed information about other releases on the same date, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the R-rating of Kraven the Hunter expected to limit its potential audience significantly?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThe R-rating of \"Kraven the Hunter\" is expected to limit its potential audience significantly. Here are the key points:\n\n- The film has been rated R for \"strong bloody violence, and language,\" which will restrict the audience to those 18 years and older in the UK, and similarly in the U.S., it will limit the audience to those 17 and older unless accompanied by an adult[1][3][4].\n- This rating will exclude a significant portion of the younger audience, which is a common demographic for many superhero movies[1][3][4].\n- The R-rating is noted to be a strong indicator that the movie will have content not suitable for younger viewers, which can reduce the overall box office potential compared to a PG-13 rating[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there no significant production or distribution issues expected to impact the release of Kraven the Hunter?\nANSWER: NO, there are significant production and distribution issues expected to impact the release of *Kraven the Hunter*.\n\nHere are some key points:\n\n- The film has undergone multiple delays, initially planned for October 2023, then shifted to August 30, 2024, and finally to December 13, 2024, due to factors such as the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes and other production issues[2][4][5].\n- The repeated delays have raised concerns about the studio's confidence in the film and its potential performance[2][5].\n- The film has undergone \"strategic reshoots\" to ensure its quality, which can indicate some level of production issues[3].\n- The decision to release the film in December, a period typically dominated by family-friendly and awards-contending films, has been questioned as potentially unfavorable for its box office performance[2][4].\n\nThese factors suggest that there are indeed significant production and distribution issues that could impact the release and reception of *Kraven the Hunter*.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Kraven the Hunter have a marketing campaign that meets or exceeds industry standards for similar films?\nANSWER: The marketing campaign for *Kraven the Hunter* has raised several concerns and does not appear to meet or exceed industry standards for similar films. Here are some key points:\n\n- The trailer release at 3AM ET, a time when most of the domestic audience is not awake, is unusual and not in line with typical marketing strategies that aim to maximize viewer engagement[2].\n- The marketing campaign has been described as \"weird\" and \"unusual,\" with some critics noting that it lacks the buzz and excitement typically generated for major superhero films[2][4].\n- The long delays and the fact that the film's surprises may already be fully revealed in the marketing materials have led to concerns that the campaign may not be effective in building anticipation[2][4].\n- The promotional approach has been compared to the failed marketing strategy of *Madame Web*, which has ignited skepticism among fans[4].\n\nGiven these points, it appears that the marketing campaign for *Kraven the Hunter* does not meet the industry standards for similar films.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the genre of Kraven the Hunter currently popular among North American audiences during the holiday season?\nANSWER: The popularity of the genre of \"Kraven the Hunter\" among North American audiences during the holiday season is uncertain based on the provided sources.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- \"Kraven the Hunter\" is an R-rated superhero movie, which is a bold move for the holiday season when family films typically dominate[4].\n- The movie faces stiff competition from other releases such as \"The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,\" \"Mufasa: The Lion King,\" and \"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\"[4].\n- While there is optimism about its potential success due to its R-rating and the performance of other R-rated films, it is unclear how well it will perform specifically during the holiday season[5].\n\nGiven these points, the popularity of the genre during the holiday season remains **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous films in the Sony Spider-Man Universe achieved domestic opening weekend revenues exceeding $20,000,000?\nANSWER: Yes, previous films in the Sony Spider-Man Universe have achieved domestic opening weekend revenues exceeding $20,000,000.\n\nFor example:\n- \"Venom\" opened with $80,255,756[2][4].\n- \"Venom: Let There Be Carnage\" opened with $90,033,210[2][4].\n- \"Madame Web\" opened with $15,335,860, which is above the $20 million mark, although it is one of the lower openings in the series[2][4].\n- \"Morbius\" opened with $39,005,895[2][4].\n- \"Venom: The Last Dance\" is not explicitly mentioned in the sources for its opening weekend, but other films in the series have clearly exceeded this threshold.\n\nThese figures are all well above the $20 million mark.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do the lead actors in Kraven the Hunter have strong fan bases that drive box office sales?\nANSWER: While the question of whether the lead actors in *Kraven the Hunter* have strong fan bases that drive box office sales is complex and involves various factors, here are some points to consider:\n\n1. **Aaron Taylor-Johnson**: He has a notable history in both Marvel and non-Marvel films. His roles in *Avengers: Age of Ultron* as Quicksilver and in other films like *Kick Ass*, *Godzilla*, and *Bullet Train* have garnered him a significant following. However, whether this following is strong enough to drive box office sales on its own is unclear[2][3][5].\n\n2. **Russell Crowe**: As an Academy Award-winning actor known for roles in *Gladiator*, *A Beautiful Mind*, and *Les Misérables*, Crowe has a substantial and dedicated fan base. His involvement in a film can attract a large audience due to his reputation and past successes[2][3][5].\n\n3. **Ariana DeBose**: Following her Oscar win for *West Side Story*, DeBose has gained significant recognition and a growing fan base. Her involvement in *Kraven the Hunter* could attract fans from her previous work, but it is still to be seen if her fan base alone can drive significant box office sales[2][3][5].\n\n4. **Fred Hechinger and Christopher Abbott**: While both actors have notable roles in other projects (*White Lotus* for Hechinger and *Catch-22* for Abbott), their fan bases may not be as extensive as those of Taylor-Johnson, Crowe, or DeBose. However, their performances could still contribute to the overall appeal of the film[2][3][5].\n\nIn summary, while the lead actors in *Kraven the Hunter* do have fan bases, the extent to which these fan bases will drive box office sales is not definitively clear. The success of the film will likely depend on a combination of factors including the actors' fan bases, the film's marketing, and the overall appeal of the story and characters.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 23 days (from November 20, 2024, to December 13, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions remain unchanged, the forecast is that the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of *Kraven the Hunter* will slightly exceed the $20,000,000 threshold. This is based on early forecasts around the $20 million mark, previous successes of the Sony Spider-Man Universe, and the film's talented cast. However, factors such as the R-rating, competition during the holiday season, and concerns about the marketing campaign introduce uncertainty.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about 5-6 days left, the ability to gain new information is limited. The forecast would rely heavily on existing data and early indicators, slightly lowering confidence. The probability estimate in this scenario would be approximately **45%**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nHaving around 92 days before the release date would allow for more comprehensive data collection, including additional marketing insights, final reviews, and potential shifts in competition. This extended timeframe could provide stronger indicators of potential success, increasing confidence in the forecast. The probability estimate in this scenario would be approximately **60%**.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe current probability estimate is influenced by several factors:\n\n1. **Early Forecasts and Base Rates:** Early predictions hover around the $20 million mark. Historically, films within the Sony Spider-Man Universe have often surpassed this threshold, though there are exceptions.\n\n2. **Competitive Release Timing:** The holiday season is crowded with major releases, which could dilute *Kraven the Hunter*'s audience share.\n\n3. **R-Rating Impact:** The R-rating might limit the audience compared to PG-13 counterparts, potentially affecting box office performance during a family-centric season.\n\n4. **Marketing Concerns:** The unconventional marketing strategies noted could hinder widespread audience awareness and enthusiasm.\n\n5. **Cast and Crew Appeal:** A strong cast and reputable director provide positive leverage, potentially offsetting some of the negative factors.\n\nConsidering these elements, there is a balanced mix of factors that both support and challenge the likelihood of exceeding the $20 million mark. The probability estimate reflects this balance, accounting for current data and the inherent uncertainties leading up to the release.\n\n**Probability: 50%**",
