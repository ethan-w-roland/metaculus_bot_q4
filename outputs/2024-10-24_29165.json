According to the [Associated Press](https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/ap-top-news/2024/06/25/russia-keeps-up-the-front-line-pressure-before-ukraine-receives-a-boost-from-western-military-aid) on June 25, 2024, the Russian military is making a new push for the area:\n\n>Relentless Russian attacks on Ukrainian positions defending the strategically important eastern town of Chasiv Yar are disrupting troop rotations and the delivery of some supplies, soldiers in the area say.\n\n>Russian troops are seeking to press their advantage in troop numbers and weaponry before Ukrainian forces are bulked up by promised new Western military aid that is already trickling to the front line, analysts say.\n\nPlease see also Wikipedia: [Battle of Chasiv Yar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chasiv_Yar)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Russia controlling Chasiv Yar by December 31, 2024, here are some key points and background information:\n\n## Current Situation\n- As of October 2024, Chasiv Yar is partially under Russian control, with Ukrainian forces having withdrawn from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July 2024. The Siverskyi Donets \u2013 Donbas Canal has become the new front line.\n- Russian forces have made advances in the area, including capturing parts of the Kanal and Novyi districts, but they have not fully secured the city. Ukrainian forces continue to defend the area, particularly west of the canal.\n\n## Military Dynamics\n- Russian forces have been conducting a grinding advance in eastern Ukraine, including around Chasiv Yar, but they have faced robust defense from Ukrainian troops. Despite numerical and artillery advantages, Russian advances have been slow and costly.\n- Ukrainian forces have successfully prevented Russian troops from breaking through their defense lines west of the Siverskyi Donets \u2013 Donbas Canal, using tactics such as drone strikes to interdict Russian ground lines of communication.\n\n## Strategic Importance\n- Chasiv Yar is strategically important due to its elevated terrain and location in Donetsk Oblast. Control of the city could facilitate further Russian advances towards other key cities like Kramatorsk and Sloviansk.\n\n## Recent Developments\n- As of late October 2024, Russian forces continue to attack the area around Chasiv Yar, but there is no clear indication of a significant breakthrough. Ukrainian forces remain committed to defending the city, and the situation is described as \"difficult but controlled\".\n\n## Base Rates and Trends\n- The conflict in the region has been characterized by slow and bloody advances, with both sides suffering significant losses. The Russian military has faced challenges in achieving rapid territorial gains despite their numerical and artillery advantages.\n\nGiven these points, while it is possible that Russia could make further gains in Chasiv Yar by December 31, 2024, the current dynamics suggest that a complete control of the city is not guaranteed. The robust defense by Ukrainian forces and the ongoing nature of the conflict make it uncertain whether Russia will achieve full control by the end of the year.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer to whether Russia will have control of Chasiv Yar on December 31, 2024, is not immediately clear. The ongoing military engagements, the strategic importance of the city, and the current defensive posture of Ukrainian forces all contribute to the uncertainty. Therefore, a definitive yes or no answer cannot be provided based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Ukrainian forces withdrawn from the eastern Kanal neighborhood of Chasiv Yar in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nUkrainian forces have withdrawn from the eastern Kanal neighborhood of Chasiv Yar in 2024. This is confirmed by multiple sources, including statements from the spokesperson for the Khortytsia group of forces, Nazar Voloshyn, who mentioned that the decision was made due to the destruction of defensive positions and the risk to the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Chasiv Yar partially under Russian control as of October 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, as of October 2024, Chasiv Yar is partially under Russian control.\n\n- Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July, and the Siverskyi Donets \u2013 Donbas Canal has been established as the new front line. Russian forces have control over parts of the city, particularly the eastern districts.\n- Despite Russian advances, Ukrainian forces maintain control over significant parts of the city, and Russian attempts to cross the canal and gain further ground have been repelled.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Russian forces captured parts of the Kanal and Novyi districts in Chasiv Yar before October 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nRussian forces had captured parts of the Kanal and Novyi districts in Chasiv Yar before October 2024. According to the sources, the Ukrainian military confirmed that Russian forces had entered the Kanal district and destroyed defenders' positions, leading to a Ukrainian retreat from this area. Additionally, Russia's Ministry of Defence claimed that its forces had taken control of the Novyi district, which lies to the west of the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal in Chasiv Yar.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are both Russian and Ukrainian forces experiencing significant losses in the conflict around Chasiv Yar in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, both Russian and Ukrainian forces are experiencing significant losses in the conflict around Chasiv Yar in 2024.\n\n- The battle of Chasiv Yar has seen intense fighting with Russian forces conducting numerous assaults, including aerial bombardments, artillery attacks, and mechanized frontal assaults. This has resulted in significant casualties on both sides.\n- Ukrainian forces have reported constant fire, extensive damage to the city, and the need to evacuate wounded soldiers due to the dangerous conditions. Russian forces have also suffered heavy losses, including fatalities and injuries from Ukrainian counter-attacks and defensive measures.\n- The high intensity of the conflict is further highlighted by the large number of artillery and mortar attacks, as well as airstrikes, which have been exchanged between the two forces in the area.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Ukrainian forces still defending areas west of the canal in Chasiv Yar as of October 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Ukrainian forces are still defending areas west of the canal in Chasiv Yar as of October 2024.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that despite Russian attempts to breach the Ukrainian defenses, the Ukrainian forces have maintained control over the areas west of the Siverskyi-Donets Donbas Canal. For example, Andrii Polukhin and Ivan Petrychak from the 24th Mechanized Brigade stated that Russian troops were unable to consolidate or advance beyond the breached points, and Ukrainian defenses remain intact.\n\nAdditionally, Major Anastasiya Bobovnikova of the Ukrainian Luhansk Group of Forces reported that Russian assault groups occasionally cross the canal but have not broken through Ukrainian defenses west of it.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Russian advances around Chasiv Yar been slow and met with significant resistance from Ukrainian forces?\nANSWER: Yes, the Russian advances around Chasiv Yar have been slow and have met with significant resistance from Ukrainian forces.\n\n- Russian forces have been engaged in relentless attacks on Chasiv Yar, but despite some advances, they have not achieved a swift or decisive victory. The town remains a fiercely contested battleground.\n- Ukrainian forces have managed to contain Russian advances, with reports indicating that while Russian troops have crossed key waterways and made some gains, they have not secured full control over the town. The Ukrainian military has continued to repel Russian attacks, preventing a critical failure in their defense lines.\n- The ongoing fighting and the lack of confirmed significant changes to the frontline around Chasiv Yar suggest that the Russian advances have been slow and met with substantial resistance.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any indication of a significant Russian breakthrough in Chasiv Yar as of October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no clear indication of a significant Russian breakthrough in Chasiv Yar as of October 2024.\n\n- The 24th Mechanised Brigade of the Ukrainian army has denied any significant Russian breakthrough near Chasiv Yar, stating that Russian forces have been unable to advance past the Kanal microdistrict due to effective Ukrainian drone interference.\n- While there are reports of Russian forces making some advances and infiltrations, these are described as limited and not indicative of a major breakthrough.\n- Other sources mention Russian efforts and some territorial gains in the broader area, but they do not confirm a significant breakthrough in Chasiv Yar itself.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Ukrainian forces successfully prevented Russian troops from breaking through defense lines west of the canal?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the situation is not entirely clear-cut, but here are the key points:\n\n- According to the Kyiv Independent, Russian forces have not managed to gain a foothold across the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal in Chasiv Yar. Ukrainian forces have been able to repel these attempts, with the spokesperson stating that Russian troops are quickly pushed back after attempting to cross the canal.\n- The Moscow Times and Jordan Times reports indicate that while Russian troops have crossed the canal, Ukrainian forces are containing the advance and preventing a significant breakthrough. The Ukrainian military spokesman mentioned that there is no critical failure and they are not about to lose Chasiv Yar.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that Ukrainian forces have been successful in preventing Russian troops from breaking through their defense lines west of the canal, although there have been ongoing and intense battles in the area.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Siverskyi Donets \u2013 Donbas Canal currently serving as the front line near Chasiv Yar?\nANSWER: Yes, the Siverskyi Donets \u2013 Donbas Canal is currently serving as the front line near Chasiv Yar. Multiple sources confirm that after Ukrainian forces withdrew from the eastern Kanal neighborhood in July, the canal has been acting as a significant barrier and the new front line in the area.\n\n- According to the DeepState report, Ukrainian forces established a defensive line along the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas Canal.\n- BBC Ukraine and other reports indicate that the canal is a key defensive barrier, with Russian troops having crossed it in some areas but the situation remaining tense and the canal acting as a front line.\n- The Kyiv Independent also mentions that the canal is now the new front line after Ukrainian forces retreated from the eastern Kanal neighborhood.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Chasiv Yar hold strategic importance due to its elevated terrain and location in Donetsk Oblast?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nChasiv Yar holds significant strategic importance due to its elevated terrain and location in Donetsk Oblast. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- The town is situated on high ground, which provides a tactical advantage and allows control over the surrounding lowlands. This elevated position overlooks cities such as Kramatorsk, Slovyansk, and Druzhkivka, making it a crucial defensive point.\n- The town's location on a ridge dominates the surrounding area, enabling Ukrainian forces to strike effectively from above and protect the surrounding agglomeration of towns.\n- Chasiv Yar's strategic location makes it a gateway to other parts of the Donetsk region still in Ukrainian hands and affects the control of key logistical routes and supply lines.\n- The town's elevated terrain and natural defensive structures make it a stronghold for Ukrainian forces, helping to limit Russian advances and protect other cities in the region.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\n- From today, October 24, 2024, until December 31, 2024, there are approximately **68 days** remaining.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\n- If the current situation remained the same until December 31, 2024, Chasiv Yar would remain partially under Russian control, with Ukrainian forces defending areas west of the Siverskyi Donets \u2013 Donbas Canal. The specific coordinates provided (48\u00b035'13.7\"N 37\u00b050'02.1\"E) would likely still be contested or under Ukrainian control. Therefore, the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\n- With approximately **17 days** left, it is unlikely that Russia would significantly alter the current situation to gain full control over Chasiv Yar. The probability of Russia controlling the specified coordinates would be minimal.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\n- With approximately **272 days** (about 9 months) remaining, there would be more opportunity for shifts in control. The prolonged timeframe could increase the likelihood of Russia gaining control over Chasiv Yar, though it would still depend on various military and strategic factors.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Situation:** As of October 2024, Chasiv Yar is partially under Russian control east of the Siverskyi Donets \u2013 Donbas Canal, with Ukrainian forces firmly defending the western areas. The canal serves as a natural barrier and frontline between the opposing forces.\n  \n- **Military Dynamics:** Russian advances have been slow and met with significant resistance. Both sides are experiencing heavy losses, and there is no clear indication of a significant breakthrough. Ukrainian forces have successfully prevented Russian troops from breaking through defense lines west of the canal.\n\n- **Timeframe Considerations:** With only about two months remaining, significant territorial changes are less likely. The onset of winter may further slow down military operations. Historical trends show that rapid territorial gains in this conflict are uncommon.\n\n- **Strategic Importance:** Chasiv Yar's elevated terrain makes it strategically valuable. Ukrainian forces are highly motivated to defend it to prevent further Russian advances into the Donetsk region.\n\n- **External Factors:** International support for Ukraine, including military aid, continues to bolster its defensive capabilities. Conversely, Russia faces logistical challenges and international sanctions that may impact its operational effectiveness.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that Russia will control the specified coordinates in Chasiv Yar by December 31, 2024, is low.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**", "probability": 20}
