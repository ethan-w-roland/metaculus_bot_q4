    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of Y2K, scheduled to open December 6, 2024, exceed $5,000,000?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the domestic box office for the opening weekend of Y2K, according to the tracking page on [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt27218960/?ref_=bo_se_r_1) exceeds USD $5,000,000.00. If the number is less than or equal to that, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf BoxOfficeMojo fails to report the number before January 1, 2025, other credible sources may be considered. If the film is not released before January 1, 2025, the question will be **annulled**. This question resolves based on the figures reported when they are accessed by Metaculus Admins, and further revisions will not be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[BoxOfficeTheory](https://boxofficetheory.com/5-week-tracking-forecasts-kraven-the-hunter-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-and-a-big-moana-2-update/), a movie forecasting company, is withholding forecasts on Y2K until more information is available. IMDB [describes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27218960/) the movie as follows: \"Two high school nobodies make the decision to crash the last major celebration before the new millennium on New Year's Eve 1999. The night becomes even crazier than they could have ever dreamed when the clock strikes midnight.\" Box Office Mojo generally [defines](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-mojo-by-imdbpro-faq/GCWTV4MQKGWRAUAP#domesticinternational) \"domestic\" as gross box-office revenue from North America (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico). According to the [Box Office by IMDbPro Glossary](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-by-imdbpro-glossary/GN8HA87MT4597FSW?ref_=mojo_ftr_glossary#boxofficetracking):\n>Box office tracking refers to theatrical box office earnings. Additional sources of revenue, such as home entertainment sales and rentals, television rights, product placement fees, etc. are not included.\n\n>Gross refers to gross earnings in U.S. dollars. On average, a movie's distributor receives a little more than half of the final gross (often referred to as the \"rentals\") with the remainder going to the exhibitor (i.e. movie theater). The money split varies from movie to movie, but, generally, the contract favors the distributor in early weeks and shifts to the exhibitor later on.\n\n>Weekend box office charts show gross receipts for a given weekend, which is Friday through Sunday unless otherwise noted. Studio estimates for the weekend are reported on Sunday mornings, generally between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Pacific Time and reflect estimated Friday and Saturday box office receipts plus a projection for Sunday.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of the film \"Y2K,\" scheduled to open on December 6, 2024, will exceed $5,000,000, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Box Office Projections\n- According to the box office tracking forecasts, \"Y2K\" is expected to have a 3-day (Friday-Sunday) opening weekend in the range of $4,000,000 to $7,500,000, with a pinpoint forecast of $6,500,000[2][5].\n\n## Market Conditions and Competition\n- The film is releasing on a weekend that also includes other notable releases such as \"Solo Leveling: ReAwakening\" and \"Werewolves,\" which could impact its box office performance. However, \"Y2K\" has a unique premise and is backed by A24, which has a dedicated fan base[2][4].\n\n## Marketing and Interest\n- The film has generated interest with its trailer and character posters, and it is positioned as a \"disaster comedy\" set during the Y2K scare, which could attract a specific audience demographic[4].\n\nGiven these points, the forecasts suggest that the domestic opening weekend box office revenue for \"Y2K\" is likely to exceed $5,000,000, as the low-end estimate is already at $4,000,000 and the pinpoint forecast is higher at $6,500,000.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the available data, it is reasonable to conclude that the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of \"Y2K\" will likely exceed $5,000,000.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is \"Y2K\" distributed by A24?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe film \"Y2K\" is distributed by A24, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there other major films releasing on the same weekend as \"Y2K\"?\nANSWER: Yes, there are other major films releasing on the same weekend as \"Y2K\". \"Y2K\" is scheduled to be released on December 6, 2024, and on the same day, another film titled \"Nightbitch\" is also set to be released[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is \"Y2K\" scheduled to be released in theaters on December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe film \"Y2K\" is scheduled to be released in theaters on December 6, 2024, as confirmed by multiple sources[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have pre-sales or advance ticket sales for \"Y2K\" exceeded typical amounts for similar films?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information regarding whether pre-sales or advance ticket sales for \"Y2K\" have exceeded typical amounts for similar films. The sources mention that advance tickets are available for \"Y2K,\" but they do not provide any comparative data or metrics to determine if the sales are exceeding typical amounts[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is \"Y2K\" widely available in a large number of theaters across North America on its opening weekend?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, \"Y2K\" is scheduled to be released on December 6, 2024, and it is listed as having a \"Wide\" release.\n\n- The Box Office Mojo source indicates that \"Y2K\" is set for a \"Wide\" release[1].\n- This suggests that it will be available in a large number of theaters across North America on its opening weekend.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does \"Y2K\" belong to an established franchise or sequel series?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the film \"Y2K\" belongs to an established franchise or sequel series. The sources describe it as a standalone film, a \"dial-up disaster comedy\" directed by Kyle Mooney and released by A24, without any mention of it being part of a larger franchise or sequel series.\n\nYES is not the correct answer because there is no evidence of it being part of a franchise or sequel series.\n\nNO is the correct answer because the sources do not indicate any connection to an established franchise or sequel series.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has \"Y2K\" received positive reviews from early critics or preview screenings?\nANSWER: The reviews for \"Y2K\" from early critics and preview screenings are mixed and do not indicate overwhelmingly positive feedback.\n\n- A review from Screen Daily describes the film as \"overworked, raunchy teen horror comedy\" that is \"too consumed by the past to mean anything substantial in the present\"[5].\n- Another review from Screen International notes that \"Y2K is a good time, but falls short of greatness\"[4].\n- The film has a Metascore of 52 on IMDb, which also suggests a mixed reception[2].\n\nGiven these sources, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as the reviews are mixed and not uniformly positive)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has A24 historically achieved opening weekend box office revenues exceeding $5,000,000 for its films?\nANSWER: Yes, A24 has historically achieved opening weekend box office revenues exceeding $5,000,000 for its films.\n\n- For example, *Civil War* opened with $25.7 million, which is the largest opening weekend for an A24 film to date[1][3][4].\n- *Hereditary* opened with $13.6 million in 2018, also exceeding the $5 million mark[1][3][4].\n- *Annihilation* opened with $11.1 million in 2018, another instance of surpassing $5 million[3].\n\nThese examples demonstrate that A24 has indeed achieved opening weekend box office revenues exceeding $5,000,000 for several of its films.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has \"Y2K\" generated significant social media buzz prior to its release?\nANSWER: The term \"Y2K\" in the context of the current question seems to refer to the fashion and cultural trend rather than the original Y2K bug.\n\nFor the Y2K fashion trend, it is clear that it generated significant social media buzz, particularly starting in 2020. Here are the key points:\n\n- The popularity of Y2K fashion was heavily influenced by social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, where users began popularizing nostalgic early 2000s fashion styles[1].\n- During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of social media spiked, and platforms like TikTok saw record-breaking usage, which contributed to the rapid spread and popularity of Y2K fashion trends[1].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a robust marketing campaign for \"Y2K\" leading up to its release?\nANSWER: The question seems to be asking about a specific entity or product named \"Y2K\" and whether there has been a robust marketing campaign for its release. However, the sources provided discuss the Y2K trend and its use in various marketing campaigns, but they do not mention a specific product or entity named \"Y2K\" that is being released.\n\n- The sources talk about using the Y2K trend in marketing campaigns for different products and brands, such as Gentle Monster, Klarna, and general marketing strategies[2][3][4].\n\nGiven the information, it is unclear whether there has been a robust marketing campaign for a specific entity or product named \"Y2K\" leading up to its release.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:** 13 days (from November 25, 2024, to December 8, 2024)\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** **Yes**, the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of \"Y2K\" would exceed $5,000,000.\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** 65%\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:** 80%\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the current date of November 25, 2024, there are 13 days remaining until the resolution of the opening weekend box office for \"Y2K\" on December 6-8, 2024. \n\n**Current Forecast:** The box office projections range from $4,000,000 to $7,500,000, with a pinpoint forecast of $6,500,000. This suggests a strong likelihood of exceeding the $5,000,000 threshold.\n\n**If Nothing Changes:** The existing forecasts, combined with A24's historical performance—where multiple films have surpassed the $5,000,000 mark—indicate that \"Y2K\" is poised to achieve the desired box office revenue. Additionally, the film's wide release and dedicated fan base further bolster this expectation.\n\n**With Limited Time Left (25% of Time):** With only about 3 days remaining, uncertainty increases slightly due to potential last-minute factors such as marketing effectiveness and competition from other releases. However, the foundational strengths of the film still provide a reasonable probability of success.\n\n**With Extended Time (4x the Time):** If there were 52 days left, more extensive data and audience reactions could be analyzed, potentially increasing confidence in the forecast. However, within the current 13-day window, the foundational projections remain strong.\n\nConsidering all factors—including BoxOfficeTheory's forecasts, A24's distribution strength, wide release strategy, and the film's unique premise—while also accounting for competition and mixed early reviews, a balanced probability estimate is appropriate.\n\n**Probability: 75%**",
