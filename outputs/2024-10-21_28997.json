{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill a senolytic therapy be approved for commercial sale by the US FDA before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if the United States Food and Drug Administration (or its successor body if current FDA ceases to exist) approves a product marketed as a senolytic therapy or drug (whether a small molecule drug, gene therapy or other class of clinical intervention) for commercial sale in the US before January 1, 2025. The approval must be given before January 1, 2025, but the actual sale of any product is not required before that date.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, an intervention will be regarded as a \"'senolytic therapy\" if it is marketed by its producer as an intervention whose purpose includes the selective removal of senescent cells, and medical evidence accepted by the FDA demonstrates that it does so.\n\nThis question will resolve as No if no such therapy is approved before January 1, 2025. If the FDA is dissolved before approval is granted, and no agency of the US government with the responsibility for granting regulatory approval for drugs and medical interventions is created to succeed it before January 1, 2025, this question will resolve as Annulled.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn recent years, a number of ventures have begun work on translating the results of some promising laboratory studies on senolytic agents into medicine for humans.\n\nA senolytic agent is an agent introduced to the body for the purpose of selectively eliminating senescent cells from the patient. Senescent cells are cells in the body that no longer divide, having reached their Hayflick limit, but which do not automatically apoptose. \n\nThese senescent cells linger in the body triggering inflammatory responses, reducing the effectiveness of the immune system, and they are associated with many age-related diseases including type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis which present a high disease and mortality burden, especially in the most-developed countries in which age-related diseases constitute the overwhelming majority of causes of death among populations.\n\nSenescent cells are thought to play an important part in the aging process, and thus it is theorised that selectively removing these senescent cells would significantly improve healthspan (and perhaps, alone or as part of a combinatorial therapy, significantly extend lifespan).\n\nOne major player in this quickly developing area of medicine is [Unity Biotechnology](https://unitybiotechnology.com/). [Its pipeline](https://unitybiotechnology.com/pipeline/) includes several drugs currently in the lead optimization phase, with UBX0101 having this year entered Phase 1 of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, FDA-approved clinical trial. \n\nYou can find out more about these first trials, and more about senolytics in general, [here]( https://www.leafscience.org/the-first-rejuvenation-therapy-reaches-human-trials/).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of a senolytic therapy being approved for commercial sale by the US FDA before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current State of Senolytic Therapy\n- Senolytic therapies are still in the early stages of clinical development. The first-in-human trial using dasatinib and quercetin showed promising but preliminary results, particularly in improving mobility in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).\n- These drugs are being tested for various age-related diseases, including IPF, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and others, but they are not yet approved for commercial sale. Clinical trials are ongoing, and the focus is on establishing safety, tolerability, and effectiveness.\n\n## Regulatory Pathway\n- The FDA has mechanisms like accelerated approval for serious or life-threatening diseases with unmet medical needs, as seen with the approvals of QALSODY for ALS and Elevidys for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. However, these approvals are typically based on surrogate endpoints or clinical benefits that need to be verified in confirmatory trials.\n\n## Time to Approval\n- Given that senolytic therapies are in the midst of clinical trials and have not yet demonstrated the necessary safety and efficacy data to support full FDA approval, it is uncertain whether any will be approved before January 1, 2025. The process of completing clinical trials, submitting data, and receiving FDA approval can be lengthy and unpredictable.\n\n## Community Predictions\n- The Metaculus community prediction for FDA approval of a senolytic therapy by January 1, 2030, stands at 54%. This indicates some optimism but also significant uncertainty about the timeline for approval.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the current state of clinical trials and the regulatory process, it is not clear whether a senolytic therapy will be approved for commercial sale by the US FDA before January 1, 2025. The ongoing nature of the clinical trials and the need for further data to support full approval suggest that the answer to this question is uncertain at this time.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any senolytic therapy received Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of any senolytic therapy receiving Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA. The sources discuss various other therapies and drugs that have received these designations, but they do not include information about senolytic therapies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Unity Biotechnology submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) for a senolytic therapy to the FDA?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nBased on the provided sources, Unity Biotechnology has not submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) or a biologics license application (BLA) to the FDA. The sources indicate that their drug candidates are in various stages of clinical development, but none have yet reached the stage of submitting an NDA or BLA.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the FDA approved any therapies using accelerated approval mechanisms for similar age-related interventions since 2020?\nANSWER: The FDA has not approved any therapies specifically for age-related interventions using the accelerated approval mechanism since 2020, based on the provided sources.\n\nThe sources primarily discuss the use of accelerated approvals for various cancer and other serious conditions, but they do not mention any approvals specifically for age-related interventions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any senolytic therapy currently under active FDA review for approval?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several senolytic therapies undergoing clinical trials, but there is no indication that any of these therapies are currently under active FDA review for approval at this time.\n\n- The sources mention various clinical trials that are ongoing or planned for different conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, diabetic chronic kidney disease, and others. However, they do not specify that any of these senolytic therapies have reached the stage of active FDA review for approval.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any senolytic therapy completed Phase 3 clinical trials as of October 21, 2024?\nANSWER: As of October 21, 2024, there is no indication that any senolytic therapy has completed Phase 3 clinical trials. The sources provided discuss various ongoing and planned clinical trials, but none mention the completion of a Phase 3 trial.\n\n- The articles mention several ongoing and planned clinical trials, including Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, but do not report any Phase 3 trials as completed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any senolytic therapy been submitted to the FDA for approval before October 21, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no evidence that any senolytic therapy has been approved by the FDA as of October 21, 2024. However, there are indications that senolytic therapies are in various stages of clinical trials and development.\n\n- An investigational new drug (IND) application for SenoVax, a senolytic immunotherapy, has been filed with the FDA, but this is for the initiation of clinical trials, not for FDA approval.\n- Several clinical trials are ongoing or planned for senolytic therapies, but none have been approved for commercial sale yet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any other companies besides Unity Biotechnology announced plans to seek FDA approval for senolytic therapies before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, other companies and research institutions have announced plans or are already involved in clinical trials for senolytic therapies, although the specific timeline of seeking FDA approval before January 1, 2025, is not explicitly stated in all cases.\n\n- The UT Health San Antonio, in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic and the Wake Forest School of Medicine, has conducted a first-in-human pilot study using the senolytic drugs dasatinib and quercetin, and they have indicated plans for further study in larger randomized, controlled trials.\n- The article on senolytic drugs mentions various clinical trials underway or beginning for conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, COVID-19, osteoarthritis, and others, which suggests multiple entities are actively pursuing senolytic therapies.\n\nWhile these sources do not provide a specific date for FDA approval, they indicate ongoing and planned clinical activities that could lead to FDA approval requests within the mentioned timeframe.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any known delays in the clinical development of senolytic therapies?\nANSWER: Yes, there are known delays and challenges in the clinical development of senolytic therapies.\n\n1. **Clinical Trial Failures and Safety Concerns**: One of the phase 2 clinical trials using the senolytic agent UBX0101 (nutlin-3a) did not achieve its primary endpoint, highlighting the potential for clinical trial failures due to the specific agents used.\n\n2. **Side Effects and Toxicities**: Several senolytic agents have shown dose-limiting toxicities, such as hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and hematologic malignancies, which have led to the discontinuation or suspension of their development.\n\n3. **Regulatory and Methodological Challenges**: The need for rigorous clinical trials to ensure safety and effectiveness has been emphasized, and the complexity of these trials, including the need for multiple, parallel smaller trials, can slow down the development process.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Implications**: Studies have raised questions about the potential risks of senolytic therapies, such as impaired tissue repair, which necessitate careful examination and further research to minimize these risks.\n\nThese factors contribute to delays and caution in the clinical development of senolytic therapies.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any senolytic therapies shown positive results in their latest clinical trials?\nANSWER: The latest clinical trials of senolytic therapies have shown promising, though preliminary, positive results in several areas:\n\n## Safety and Tolerability\n- The first clinical trial of senolytic therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q) demonstrated that the treatment was well-tolerated with no premature discontinuation and only a few adverse events, indicating good safety and feasibility.\n\n## Target Engagement\n- In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), intermittent administration of D+Q improved physical function and reduced senescent cell burden, inflammation, and fibrosis.\n\n## CNS Penetrance\n- The trial for AD showed that dasatinib was detectable in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after treatment, indicating CNS penetrance, although quercetin was not detectable in CSF.\n\n## Biomarkers and Functional Status\n- Preliminary data from the AD trial suggested changes in markers of cellular senescence and Alzheimer's disease pathology, although the study was not designed to evaluate efficacy.\n\n## Other Indications\n- Clinical trials in other conditions, such as diabetic kidney disease, have shown that intermittent dosing of D+Q can decrease adipose tissue senescent cell burden, inflammation, and fibrosis, indicating target engagement and potential therapeutic benefits.\n\nWhile these results are promising, it is important to note that larger, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed to fully assess the safety, efficacy, and long-term benefits of senolytic therapies.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any regulatory or safety concerns reported for senolytic therapies in recent studies?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several regulatory and safety concerns reported for senolytic therapies in recent studies.\n\n## Safety Concerns\n- Conventional senolytic agents can have concerning and long-term side effects, such as targeting cellular aging signals directly, which has prompted the search for alternative approaches with fewer side effects.\n- The use of senolytic drugs like dasatinib and quercetin, although effective, has limitations and potential side effects. For example, navitoclax (ABT-263), another senolytic agent, has restricted efficacy to specific cell types and can have off-target effects.\n- Senescent cells can evade immune cell clearance, and senolytic treatments may need to be carefully designed to avoid strong side effects and ensure specificity to senescent cells. For instance, the development of targeted therapies like Nav-Gal, which activates only in senescent cells, is aimed at reducing off-target effects.\n\n## Regulatory and Clinical Development Challenges\n- The preclinical development of senolytic therapies is challenging due to the need to avoid strong side effects and the intrinsic resistance of senescent cells to apoptotic stimuli. This makes most cytotoxic drugs inefficient against these cells.\n- There is a lack of gold-standard biomarkers for the senescent state, which complicates the quantification of senescent cells and the determination of the efficacy of senolytic drugs. This is a significant challenge for clinical development.\n- Tumor heterogeneity can lead to varied drug responses and limit the effectiveness of senolytic agents, contributing to resistance and side effects.\n\n## Immunological Consequences\n- The impact of senolytics on the immune system is a concern, as eliminating senescent cells may have acute beneficial effects but could also negatively impact immunological memory. Further investigation is needed to understand the long-term immunological consequences of senolytic treatments.\n\nThese concerns highlight the need for careful consideration and further research to ensure the safety and efficacy of senolytic therapies.", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 72 days remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nNo.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nNo.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nProbability might increase slightly but would still remain low, possibly around 10-15%.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**Current Timeframe and Regulatory Process:**  \nWith only about 2 months and 12 days left until the deadline, the window for a senolytic therapy to progress from its current stage to FDA approval is exceedingly narrow. Typically, the FDA approval process for new therapies involves multiple phases, including the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA), a comprehensive review period, and potentially additional rounds of data requests or revisions. Given that no senolytic therapies have completed Phase 3 clinical trials or submitted an NDA as of October 21, 2024, there is insufficient time for these critical steps to be completed within the remaining 72 days.\n\n**Current Development Stage:**  \nSenolytic therapies are still in the early to mid-stages of clinical development. The first-in-human trials are just underway, and therapies are yet to demonstrate the robust safety and efficacy data required for FDA approval. The absence of Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designations further indicates that there are no expedited pathways currently in place for these therapies, which would be necessary to accelerate the approval process within such a tight timeframe.\n\n**Regulatory and Clinical Challenges:**  \nThe development of senolytic therapies faces several challenges, including potential side effects, the need for precise targeting of senescent cells, and the absence of standardized biomarkers for evaluating treatment efficacy. These factors add layers of complexity and time to the approval process, making rapid advancement unlikely.\n\n**Scenario Analysis:**\n- **If only a quarter of the time left (~18 days):**  \n  The likelihood of achieving FDA approval becomes virtually nonexistent, as regulatory reviews and necessary administrative processes cannot be expedited to fit within such a short period.\n\n- **If there were 4x the time left (~288 days):**  \n  While an extended timeframe might provide more opportunities for clinical trials to progress and for NDAs to be submitted and reviewed, the fundamental challenges and current development stages would still limit the probability of approval by January 1, 2025. Even with additional time, significant breakthroughs or accelerated regulatory actions would be required to substantially increase the likelihood of approval.\n\n**Comparative Insights:**  \nThe Metaculus community's prediction of a 54% probability for FDA approval by January 1, 2030, underscores the cautious optimism surrounding senolytic therapies. Extending this perspective to the much shorter 72-day window further diminishes the probability, given the current status of clinical development and regulatory prerequisites.\n\n**Final Assessment:**  \nConsidering the limited time remaining, the current developmental stage of senolytic therapies, and the stringent requirements of the FDA approval process, it is highly unlikely that a senolytic therapy will receive FDA approval for commercial sale by January 1, 2025.\n\n**Probability: 5%**", "probability": 5}
