    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah win 55% or more of the vote in the first round of the Namibian presidential election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-31\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah wins greater than or equal to 55.0% of the vote in the 2024 Namibian presidential election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIn case of delayed results, this question will wait until January 1, 2025 for final reported results, at which point it will be **annulled**. Other overturnings of this question's assumptions such as cancelled elections will cause the question to be **annulled**. Please note that this a non-exhaustive list of edge cases that would cause annulment or ambiguous resolutions, and forecasters are encouraged to refer to Metaculus's ambiguity and annulment policies [here](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#ambiguous-annulled) in case of any questions.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nWikipedia: [2024 Namibian general election\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Namibian_general_election)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah winning 55% or more of the vote in the first round of the Namibian presidential election, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context and Trends\n- In the 2019 presidential election, President Hage Geingob of SWAPO won with 56.3% of the vote, a significant drop from his 86.7% in 2014. This trend indicates a decline in SWAPO's electoral dominance.\n\n## Current Electoral Landscape\n- Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, the SWAPO candidate, is expected to face strong competition, particularly from Panduleni Itula of the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), who secured 29.4% of the vote in the 2019 election.\n\n## Voter Sentiment and Demographics\n- There is growing discontent among voters, especially younger and urban voters, due to poor living standards, high unemployment, and perceptions of corruption. This could further erode SWAPO's support.\n\n## Electoral Projections\n- Fitch Solutions and other analyses suggest that while SWAPO is likely to retain its parliamentary majority, the presidential race is expected to be closely fought. The probability of Nandi-Ndaitwah winning the presidency is forecasted, but with a narrower margin than previous SWAPO candidates.\n\n## Opposition Strength\n- The opposition, particularly Panduleni Itula, has been gaining ground, and the fragmented opposition landscape might still split votes, but Itula's performance in 2019 indicates a significant challenge to SWAPO's dominance.\n\nGiven these points, while Nandi-Ndaitwah is expected to be a strong contender, the likelihood of her winning 55% or more of the vote in the first round is uncertain. The declining vote share of SWAPO, growing opposition, and voter discontent suggest that achieving such a high percentage might be challenging.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- SWAPO's vote share has been declining, and the last election saw Geingob win with just 56.3%, which is close to the 55% threshold but indicates a narrowing margin.\n- The increasing competitiveness of the electoral environment and the rise of opposition candidates suggest that the election outcome could be more closely contested than in previous years.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The election is scheduled for November 27, 2024, providing a clear timeline for when the outcome will be known.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- Economic conditions, such as high unemployment and stagnant GDP per capita, are likely to influence voter behavior and could impact SWAPO's performance.\n\nIn summary, while Nandi-Ndaitwah is a strong candidate, the current trends and electoral landscape suggest that winning 55% or more of the vote in the first round is not a certainty. The answer to whether she will achieve this threshold is not immediately clear and depends on various factors, including voter turnout, opposition performance, and the overall electoral environment.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do recent opinion polls show Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah polling at or above 55%?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not include any recent opinion polls or specific polling data regarding Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah's current polling numbers. Therefore, it is unclear whether she is polling at or above 55%.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do recent opinion polls show Panduleni Itula polling above 25%?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the most relevant information about the 2024 Namibian presidential election can be found in the Metaculus forecast.\n\nAccording to the Metaculus forecast, Dr. Panduleni Itula is predicted to have about 7.3% of the vote, which is below 25%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major opposition parties formed a coalition for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: YES, major opposition parties in South Africa have formed a coalition for the 2024 election. The African National Congress (ANC), which lost its parliamentary majority, has formed a coalition government with its main opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), and the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP). This coalition was announced after extensive negotiations following the May 29 election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Panduleni Itula announced his candidacy for the 2024 Namibian presidential election?\nANSWER: Yes, Panduleni Itula has announced his candidacy for the 2024 Namibian presidential election. This is confirmed by multiple sources, including his interview where he discusses his campaign and strategies for the upcoming election, and other reports that list him as a candidate for the presidency.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Namibian economy been experiencing high unemployment rates in 2023 and 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the Namibian economy has been experiencing high unemployment rates in 2023 and 2024.\n\n- In 2023, the unemployment rate in Namibia decreased to 19.60% from 20% in 2022.\n- For 2024, the unemployment rate is expected to reach 20.70% according to economic models and analysts' expectations.\n\nThese rates indicate that unemployment remains a significant issue in Namibia.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah increased her popularity among urban and young voters in 2024?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not offer specific data or surveys that directly measure the change in Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah's popularity among urban and young voters in 2024.\n\nWhile the sources do mention that Nandi-Ndaitwah is SWAPO's presidential candidate and that she has launched a manifesto that includes initiatives aimed at youth empowerment and urban development, they do not provide concrete evidence of an increase in her popularity among these specific groups.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has SWAPO's vote share in presidential elections declined in each of the last two elections?\nANSWER: Yes, SWAPO's vote share in presidential elections has declined in each of the last two elections.\n\n- In the 2014 presidential election, SWAPO's candidate, Hage Geingob, won with 86.7% of the vote. However, in the 2019 presidential election, his vote share dropped to 56.3%.\n- This trend indicates a decline in SWAPO's vote share from 2014 to 2019, and the forecasts for the 2024 elections suggest further challenges for the party, although the exact vote share for 2024 is not yet determined.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah been involved in any significant recent corruption scandals?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no direct evidence that Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah has been personally involved in any significant recent corruption scandals. However, there are criticisms and allegations surrounding her and the Swapo party's handling of corruption issues.\n\n- Nandi-Ndaitwah has spoken out against corruption and urged party members to root it out, but she has been criticized by opposition leaders for not speaking out strongly enough on specific corruption cases, such as the Fishrot fraud and the ballot paper tender scandal.\n- There are no direct allegations or evidence linking Nandi-Ndaitwah personally to corruption scandals in the sources provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has voter discontent with SWAPO increased significantly since the 2019 election?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nSeveral sources indicate a significant increase in voter discontent with SWAPO since the 2019 election. Here are some key points:\n\n- The 2019 national elections saw a sharp drop in support for SWAPO, with the party's vote share falling from 80% in 2014 to 65.5% in 2019. President Hage Geingob's vote share also dropped from 87% to 56.3% during the same period.\n\n- The regional and local government elections held after 2019 further highlighted the growing discontent, with SWAPO suffering numerous defeats at these levels of government. This included the loss of control over several regional councils and the capital city of Windhoek.\n\n- Issues such as growing corruption, governance failures, and the #fishrot scandal have continued to erode trust in SWAPO. The party's response to these issues, including deflection and scapegoating, has not alleviated the dissatisfaction among voters.\n\n- Youth disenchantment, particularly due to high unemployment rates and poor economic conditions, has also contributed to SWAPO's dwindling popularity. Young voters, who make up a significant portion of the electorate, have become increasingly hostile to the governing party.\n\n- The ongoing economic crisis, social inequality, and unresolved land issues have further compounded the discontent among Namibian voters.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major policy successes by the SWAPO government since 2019 that might boost their electoral prospects?\nANSWER: While the sources provide detailed information about the challenges and declining popularity of the SWAPO government, they also highlight some areas that could be considered policy successes or positive developments since 2019, although these may not necessarily boost their electoral prospects significantly.\n\n### Economic Stabilization and Infrastructure Development\n- The SWAPO government has been credited with economic stabilization, as the proportion of the population living below the poverty line dropped from 69.3% in 1990 to 17.4% in 2023.\n- There have been significant investments in infrastructure, including roads, ports, energy generation, and telecommunications, which have more than doubled since 1990.\n\n### Job Creation and Industrialization\n- The 2020-2025 manifesto and the new 2025-2030 manifesto include commitments to create employment opportunities, with a goal of creating over 250,000 jobs in the next five years. The manifestos also emphasize industrialization, including the development of special economic zones (SEZs) and the promotion of local and regional value chains.\n\n### Education, Healthcare, and Social Welfare\n- SWAPO has highlighted its achievements in education, healthcare, and reducing income inequality. The manifestos outline a broad framework for national development, focusing on these areas.\n\nHowever, despite these achievements, the sources also indicate several challenges that might offset these successes in terms of electoral prospects:\n- High unemployment, particularly among youth, remains a significant issue.\n- SWAPO has lost its two-thirds majority in Parliament and its dominance in local councils, reflecting a decline in voter support.\n- Internal factionalism, corruption scandals, and dissatisfaction among young voters continue to erode SWAPO's popularity.\n\nGiven this mixed picture, while there have been some policy successes, it is unclear whether these will be enough to significantly boost SWAPO's electoral prospects.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of today, **October 31, 2024**, the Namibian presidential election is scheduled for **November 27, 2024**. This means there are approximately **27 days** left until the election takes place. The official results are typically announced shortly after the election, so the outcome should be known within **one month** from now.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf the current trends and conditions persist without significant changes, it is **unlikely** that Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah will win **55% or more** of the vote in the first round. Several factors support this assessment:\n\n- **Declining SWAPO Vote Share:** SWAPO's vote share has been declining over the past two presidential elections, dropping from **86.7% in 2014** to **56.3% in 2019**. This trend indicates a reduction in the party's dominance.\n- **Increased Voter Discontent:** There is significant voter dissatisfaction due to economic hardships, high unemployment rates, especially among the youth, and perceptions of corruption within the government.\n- **Strengthening Opposition:** Panduleni Itula, who received **29.4%** of the vote in 2019, is running again and is expected to mount a substantial challenge. The opposition has been gaining traction, and while no major coalition has formed, the fragmented opposition could still erode SWAPO's vote share.\n- **Lack of Major Policy Successes:** There are no clear indications of significant policy successes by the SWAPO government since 2019 that could bolster their popularity sufficiently to achieve over 55% of the vote.\n\nGiven these factors, if nothing changes, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah is **unlikely** to secure 55% or more of the vote in the first round.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 7 days):**\n\nWith only **7 days** left until the election, the probability of significant shifts in voter sentiment or political dynamics is reduced. Campaigns and political strategies would already be in their final stages, and last-minute changes are less likely to impact the overall outcome dramatically. In this scenario, I would maintain a similar forecast, perhaps with **slightly increased confidence** due to the reduced time for unexpected events. The probability of Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah winning 55% or more of the vote would remain **low**, around the same estimate.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left (approximately 108 days):**\n\nIf there were approximately **108 days** left until the election, there would be more time for potential changes that could influence the election outcome. This extended period could allow for:\n\n- **Policy Announcements or Successes:** SWAPO could implement or highlight successful policies that address voter concerns, potentially increasing support.\n- **Political Developments:** Alliances could form, candidates could withdraw, or scandals could emerge that might significantly impact voter sentiment.\n- **Economic Changes:** Improvements in the economy or employment rates could bolster the incumbent party's popularity.\n\nHowever, given the current trends and historical context, unless significant positive developments occur for Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah and SWAPO, the probability of her winning 55% or more of the vote would still be **uncertain**. The increased time adds **more uncertainty** to the forecast, but without concrete indications of a positive shift, the probability might remain **low**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Trends:** SWAPO's declining vote share over the past two elections suggests a continued erosion of support. From **86.7% in 2014** to **56.3% in 2019**, the trend indicates challenges in maintaining a majority.\n  \n- **Voter Discontent:** High unemployment rates, especially among the youth (unemployment projected to reach **20.7% in 2024**), economic hardships, and corruption scandals (like the **Fishrot scandal**) have increased dissatisfaction with the SWAPO government.\n\n- **Opposition Strength:** Panduleni Itula's strong performance in 2019 and his candidacy in 2024 present a significant challenge. While the opposition is fragmented, Itula's support could further reduce SWAPO's vote share.\n\n- **Lack of Recent Polls:** There is an absence of recent opinion polls showing Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah polling at or above 55%, making it difficult to justify a higher probability based on current data.\n\n- **SWAPO's Initiatives:** While SWAPO has introduced manifestos aiming at youth empowerment and economic development, there's no clear evidence that these have significantly increased Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah's popularity among key voter groups.\n\n- **No Major Policy Successes:** Since 2019, there haven't been major policy successes that could substantially boost SWAPO's electoral prospects to the level required.\n\nConsidering these factors, and the proximity of the election, it is **unlikely** that Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah will win **55% or more** of the vote in the first round. The trends point towards a **continued decline** in SWAPO's dominance and an **increasingly competitive** electoral environment.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
