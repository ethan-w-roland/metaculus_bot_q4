    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the US State Department approve more than 25 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves based on the total number of arms sales approvals by the US State Department listed at the Major Arms Sales [notifications page](https://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/archive-date/202410) by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency for October 2024, November 2024, and December 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on January 1, 2025.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNote that some State Department arms approvals are subject to congressional approval; however, this question only asks about arms sales listed at the resolution source as being approved by the State Department, even if later rejected by Congress.\n\nEvery listing will count as only one event, regardless of the number of types of equipment listed.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe United States is the largest arms exporter in the world, [accounting for](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/fs_2403_at_2023.pdf) 42% of global arms exports, with France and Russia tied for a distant 2nd, at 11%, and China in 4th place at 6%. In the past 5 years, State Department-approved arms sales per month have been as follows:\n\n| Month           | Number |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| October 2024    | 9      |\n| September 2024  | 12     |\n| August 2024     | 22     |\n| July 2024       | 4      |\n| June 2024       | 7      |\n| May 2024        | 10     |\n| April 2024      | 7      |\n| March 2024      | 10     |\n| February 2024   | 8      |\n| January 2024    | 7      |\n| December 2023   | 17     |\n| November 2023   | 5      |\n| October 2023    | 7      |\n| September 2023  | 7      |\n| August 2023     | 5      |\n| July 2023       | 4      |\n| June 2023       | 12     |\n| May 2023        | 7      |\n| April 2023      | 6      |\n| March 2023      | 10     |\n| February 2023   | 5      |\n| December 2022   | 6      |\n| November 2022   | 8      |\n| October 2022    | 3      |\n| September 2022  | 5      |\n| August 2022     | 7      |\n| July 2022       | 13     |\n| June 2022       | 3      |\n| May 2022        | 4      |\n| April 2022      | 6      |\n| March 2022      | 4      |\n| February 2022   | 9      |\n| January 2022    | 5      |\n| December 2021   | 5      |\n| November 2021   | 1      |\n| October 2021    | 1      |\n| September 2021  | 2      |\n| August 2021     | 8      |\n| July 2021       | 3      |\n| June 2021       | 4      |\n| May 2021        | 3      |\n| April 2021      | 4      |\n| March 2021      | 6      |\n| February 2021   | 5      |\n| December 2020   | 15     |\n| November 2020   | 6      |\n| October 2020    | 11     |\n| September 2020  | 9      |\n| August 2020     | 2      |\n| July 2020       | 15     |\n| June 2020       | 2      |\n| May 2020        | 7      |\n| April 2020      | 8      |\n| March 2020      | 4      |\n| February 2020   | 5      |\n| January 2020    | 2      |\n| December 2019   | 1      |\n| November 2019   | 5      |\n| October 2019    | 8      |\n| September 2019  | 5      |\n\nThe average per month is 6.7. The month of August 2024, with 22 sales, was the record highest since the monthly archive begin, in 2004.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the US State Department approving more than 25 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context and Volume of Sales\n- The US engages in a significant number of arms sales annually. For example, in Fiscal Year 2023, the total authorized value for privately contracted Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) was $157.5 billion, and government-to-government Foreign Military Sales (FMS) totaled $80.9 billion.\n- The State Department regularly approves multiple arms sales each quarter, as evidenced by the notifications and approvals listed on the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) website.\n\n## Congressional Review Process\n- The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) requires the President to formally notify Congress 30 calendar days before issuing a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) for FMS sales, or before the State Department issues the relevant export license for DCS transactions. This process suggests a structured and ongoing approval mechanism.\n\n## Transparency and Reporting\n- While there is a lack of transparency in public notifications for DCS transactions, the scale and frequency of these sales indicate that numerous approvals are likely to occur each quarter. However, the exact number of approvals might not be publicly disclosed until after the fact.\n\n## Base Rates\n- Given the historical volume of arms sales and the ongoing nature of these transactions, it is plausible that the State Department would approve a substantial number of arms sales in any given quarter.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the exact number of approvals for the fourth quarter of 2024 cannot be determined with certainty from the available information, the historical context and the ongoing nature of US arms sales suggest that approving more than 25 arms sales globally in that quarter is within the realm of possibility. However, without specific quarterly data or forecasts, this remains an informed speculation rather than a definitive answer.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the US State Department approve an unusually high number of arms sales in the third quarter of 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe provided sources do not contain specific information about the number of arms sales approved by the US State Department in the third quarter of 2024. The sources discuss general procedures and thresholds for arms sales, historical data, and some specific sales cases, but they do not provide real-time or quarterly data for 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US State Department ever approved more than 25 arms sales in a single quarter since 2004?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or mention of the number of arms sales approvals by the US State Department on a quarterly basis since 2004. The sources provide annual and multi-year data on arms sales and transfers but do not break it down to the quarterly level.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant arms deals known to be pending approval in the fourth quarter of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about pending arms deals in the fourth quarter of 2024 that are awaiting approval. The sources detail various arms sales notifications and agreements up to the point of the sources' last updates, but they do not provide information on pending deals specifically for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US presidential election in November 2024 impacted the pace or likelihood of arms sales approvals this quarter?\nANSWER: The information provided in the sources does not directly address how the US presidential election in November 2024 has impacted the pace or likelihood of arms sales approvals this quarter.\n\n- The sources discuss candidate positions on various issues, including arms sales and military assistance, but they do not provide real-time or specific data on the current quarter's arms sales approvals.\n- There is no mention of any immediate or current impact of the election on the pace or likelihood of arms sales approvals in the given sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major international defense contracts been announced or negotiated that are likely to be approved in the fourth quarter of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about major international defense contracts that have been announced or negotiated and are likely to be approved in the fourth quarter of 2024. The sources discuss general trends, industry outlooks, and existing contracts, but they do not provide details on upcoming or pending international defense contracts for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the average monthly number of arms sales approvals increased in 2024 compared to previous years?\nANSWER: The information provided does not directly address the average monthly number of arms sales approvals in 2024 compared to previous years.\n\n- The sources discuss specific legislative changes and ongoing issues in the foreign military sales process, such as the proposed increase in dollar thresholds for notifying Congress about arms sales and the backlog in arms deliveries.\n- They also detail significant arms sales and assistance to specific countries, like Israel, but do not provide a comparative analysis of the monthly number of arms sales approvals.\n- There is no data or analysis in the sources that compares the monthly frequency of arms sales approvals in 2024 to previous years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there increased demand from foreign allies for US arms due to recent geopolitical developments in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there is increased demand from foreign allies for US arms due to recent geopolitical developments.\n\nSeveral sources indicate this trend:\n\n- The US Air Force expects a 60% increase in foreign military sales in fiscal 2024, driven by a growing sense of global instability and increased demand from allies to bolster their defense arsenals.\n\n- The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) reports that the USA increased its arms exports by 17% between 2014–18 and 2019–23, and that European states nearly doubled their imports of major arms during the same period, largely due to concerns over Russian and Chinese ambitions.\n\n- The Foreign Military Sales program has seen increased activity, with the US aiming to build capacity and capability in partner nations, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, in response to concerns over China’s military ambitions.\n\nThese sources collectively indicate that recent geopolitical tensions have led to a significant increase in demand for US arms from foreign allies.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent policy changes that facilitate more frequent or expedited arms sales approvals by the US State Department?\nANSWER: There have been some developments and changes, but they do not necessarily facilitate more frequent or expedited arms sales approvals in a general sense. Here are a few points to consider:\n\n1. **Emergency Certifications and Under Threshold Transfers**: While there have been instances where emergency certifications have been used to waive congressional review requirements, as seen in the case of arms transfers to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Jordan in 2019, these are not policy changes but rather exceptions to the existing process.\n\n2. **Notification Thresholds and Transparency**: There have been changes in notification thresholds and transparency, particularly with the transfer of certain firearms to the Commerce Control List, which removed them from the $1 million Congressional notification threshold. However, this does not expedite the approval process for major arms sales but rather affects the transparency and notification requirements for certain types of sales.\n\n3. **Informal Notifications and Tiered Review**: The State Department has a longstanding practice of submitting informal notifications before formal notifications, which can provide earlier insight to Congress. However, this is not a recent policy change but an ongoing practice since 1976 and refined in 2012.\n\n4. **Recent Administrative Actions**: The Biden administration introduced a new notification process for licenses valued at $4 million over 4 years in July 2022 and revised rules in 2024 to promise more transparency. However, these changes are more focused on increasing transparency rather than expediting the approval process.\n\nIn summary, while there have been some adjustments and clarifications in the processes and transparency related to arms sales, these do not constitute recent policy changes aimed at facilitating more frequent or expedited arms sales approvals.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any indications that the US is boosting arms exports as part of new defense or foreign policy strategies in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are indications that the US is boosting arms exports as part of its defense and foreign policy strategies, although the specific context for 2024 is partly inferred from recent trends and statements.\n\n1. **Recent Trends and Record Exports**: The US has seen a significant increase in arms exports in recent years, particularly driven by the war in Ukraine. In the 2023 fiscal year, US government arms transfers and foreign defense services reached a record high of $80.9 billion, up more than 55 percent from 2022.\n\n2. **Continued Commitment**: The Biden administration has indicated that it is committed to maintaining high levels of arms exports, with plans to make 2024 another strong year for weapons sales. This suggests a continued strategy of supporting allies and countering adversaries through arms exports.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Context**: The increase in arms exports is also aligned with broader foreign policy goals, such as supporting Europe and countering Russian influence. This strategic approach is likely to continue into 2024, given the ongoing geopolitical tensions.\n\n4. **Market Share and Export Volume**: The US has significantly increased its share of global arms exports between 2014-2018 and 2019-2023, and it is expected to remain the largest exporter of major arms beyond 2023.\n\nThese points collectively indicate that the US is indeed boosting its arms exports as part of its ongoing defense and foreign policy strategies.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an ongoing global conflict or increase in international tensions that could lead to more US arms sales in the fourth quarter of 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several ongoing global conflicts and increasing international tensions that could potentially lead to more U.S. arms sales in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n1. **Escalation in Gaza and the Middle East**: The conflict in Gaza is highly intense, with significant civilian casualties and regional tensions that could lead to broader conflicts involving other countries, including potential involvement of the U.S..\n\n2. **Continued Conflict in Ukraine**: The war in Ukraine is expected to continue, with potential escalation involving intensified military operations, which could lead to increased demand for arms from countries involved or supporting the conflict.\n\n3. **Rising Tensions Between the U.S. and China**: Experts are concerned about growing tensions across the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea, which could precipitate a severe cross-strait crisis involving the U.S. and other countries in the region, potentially increasing arms sales.\n\n4. **Conflict in Sudan and the Sahel Region**: Ongoing conflicts in Sudan and the Sahel region, involving multiple armed groups and state forces, are likely to continue, which could lead to increased arms sales to countries in these regions or to international actors involved in these conflicts.\n\n5. **Growing Political Polarization and Potential Domestic Violence in the U.S.**: While not directly related to international arms sales, the growing risk of domestic terrorism and political violence in the U.S. could lead to increased domestic arms purchases, but more significantly, the international tensions and conflicts mentioned could drive foreign countries to seek more arms from the U.S..\n\n6. **Potential Military Confrontations Involving Iran, Israel, and North Korea**: The possibility of direct military confrontations between these countries and their allies could also drive an increase in arms sales as countries prepare for potential conflicts.\n\nThese factors collectively indicate a heightened state of global conflict and tension that could lead to increased demand for U.S. arms sales in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
    "comment": "(a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nThere are **2 months** left until the outcome is known on January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed (i.e., no additional arms sales approvals in November and December 2024), the total number of approvals in Q4 2024 would be **9 approvals** from October 2024. This is less than 25, so the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there was only a quarter of the time left (i.e., half a month remaining), I would have more data from November and potentially early December. Based on historical patterns and any additional approvals by that time, I might forecast a **lower probability** if approvals remain average, or a **higher probability** if there is an upward trend in approvals.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there was 4 times the time left (i.e., **8 months** remaining), there would be greater uncertainty due to potential fluctuations over time. I would base my forecast more on historical averages and consider geopolitical trends, likely assigning a probability closer to the **long-term average**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nWe are forecasting whether the US State Department will approve **more than 25 arms sales** globally in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024, which includes October, November, and December.\n\n1. **Current Status:**\n\n   - **October 2024**: Already recorded **9 approvals**.\n   - To exceed 25 approvals, **17 more approvals** are needed in November and December combined.\n\n2. **Historical Data:**\n\n   - **Average approvals per month**: Approximately **6.7**.\n   - **Recent months** show variability:\n     - **September 2024**: 12 approvals\n     - **August 2024**: 22 approvals (record high)\n     - **Previous Decembers**:\n       - December 2023: 17 approvals\n       - December 2022: 6 approvals\n       - December 2021: 5 approvals\n       - December 2020: 15 approvals\n\n3. **Geopolitical Factors:**\n\n   - **Increased demand** due to geopolitical tensions (e.g., conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine, tensions with China).\n   - US is **boosting arms exports** as part of defense and foreign policy strategies.\n   - **Allied nations** are seeking to bolster defenses amid global instability.\n\n4. **Potential Scenarios:**\n\n   - **Optimistic Scenario** (higher approvals):\n     - **November**: 12 approvals (similar to September 2024)\n     - **December**: 10 approvals (consistent with higher historical Decembers)\n     - **Total Q4 Approvals**: 9 (Oct) + 12 (Nov) + 10 (Dec) = **31 approvals**\n   - **Average Scenario**:\n     - **November and December**: 6.7 approvals each (historical average)\n     - **Total Q4 Approvals**: 9 + 6.7 + 6.7 ≈ **22 approvals**\n\n5. **Assessment:**\n\n   - Given the current trend of increased approvals and heightened global tensions, it's **plausible** that November and December 2024 will have higher-than-average approvals.\n   - There is **precedent** for high approval numbers in these months, especially during periods of geopolitical instability.\n   - However, variability is high, and approvals could regress to the mean.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
