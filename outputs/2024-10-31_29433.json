    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill North Dakota voters approve Initiated Measure 5, which would legalize recreational marijuana in the state?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-31\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if North Dakota Initiated Measure 5 is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reporting. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [North Dakota Initiated Measure 5, Marijuana Legalization Initiative (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/North_Dakota_Initiated_Measure_5,_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo make an informed prediction on whether North Dakota voters will approve Initiated Measure 5, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana, here are some key points and context:\n\n## Previous Voting History\nNorth Dakota voters have previously rejected similar ballot initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana in both 2018 and 2022. This historical context suggests a pattern of voter reluctance towards legalizing recreational marijuana.\n\n## Support and Opposition Arguments\nSupporters of the measure, such as New Economic Frontier, argue that legalizing cannabis can fuel economic development, create jobs, stimulate tourism, and generate tax revenue. They also highlight the redirection of law enforcement resources away from minor cannabis offenses to more serious crimes.\n\nOpponents, including various health and religious organizations, argue that marijuana use is associated with significant health risks, such as substance use disorders, impaired cognitive function, mental health issues, and increased crime and public safety concerns. The Catholic Church in North Dakota has also strongly opposed the measure, citing the harmful effects of marijuana on health and society.\n\n## Regulatory and Fiscal Impact\nIf approved, the measure would require the Department of Health and Human Services or another designated agency to establish regulations for the production and distribution of marijuana by October 1, 2025. The estimated fiscal impact includes revenues of $10,227,600 and expenses of $8,324,275 for the 2025-2027 biennium, along with undetermined additional costs related to behavioral health and social impacts.\n\n## Current State of Similar Initiatives\nOther states that have legalized recreational marijuana have reported various outcomes, including increased drug use, mental health problems, and other societal issues. This could influence voter perceptions and decisions.\n\nGiven these points, the outcome of the vote is not immediately clear, as it depends on how voters weigh the economic benefits against the potential health and social risks. The historical rejection of similar measures and strong opposition from certain groups suggest that approval is not guaranteed, but the decision ultimately rests with the voters.\n\n### Base Rates\n- Previous rejections in 2018 and 2022.\n- National trends and outcomes in other states that have legalized recreational marijuana.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The vote is scheduled for November 5, 2024.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- Ongoing debates about the health and social impacts of marijuana legalization.\n- Economic considerations in the context of current economic conditions.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Outcomes in other states that have legalized recreational marijuana.\n- Previous voter behavior in North Dakota on similar initiatives.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is North Dakota Initiated Measure 5 confirmed to be on the 2024 general election ballot?\nANSWER: Yes, North Dakota Initiated Measure 5, the Marijuana Legalization Initiative, is confirmed to be on the 2024 general election ballot.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did North Dakota voters reject a similar recreational marijuana legalization measure in 2022?\nANSWER: Yes, North Dakota voters rejected a recreational marijuana legalization measure in 2022. The initiative, which was intended to legalize adult-use cannabis, did not pass when it was put to a vote in the November 2022 election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout in North Dakota expected to be higher in the 2024 election compared to previous years?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not offer specific predictions or data indicating whether voter turnout in North Dakota is expected to be higher in the 2024 election compared to previous years.\n\n- The sources provide information on the 2024 election dates, candidates, and ballot measures, but they do not include forecasts or analyses of voter turnout expectations.\n- Historical voter turnout data is mentioned, but there is no indication of expected turnout for the 2024 election.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any legal challenges that could prevent Initiated Measure 5 from being voted on in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that Initiated Measure 5 in North Dakota is facing legal challenges that could prevent it from being voted on in 2024. The sources discuss various legal challenges and attacks on ballot measures in other states, but they do not mention any such challenges specifically related to North Dakota's Initiated Measure 5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant opposition to Initiated Measure 5 from influential organizations in North Dakota?\nANSWER: Yes, there is significant opposition to Initiated Measure 5 from influential organizations in North Dakota. Opponents of the measure include the North Dakota Medical and Hospital Associations, the North Dakota Peace Officers, the Chiefs of Police Association of North Dakota, and the North Dakota Sheriffs and Deputies Associations. These groups have expressed concerns about the potential increase in substance use and associated harms, and they advocate for a cautious approach to policy changes related to marijuana legalization.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any prominent North Dakota political leaders publicly endorsed Initiated Measure 5?\nANSWER: While there are supporters of Initiated Measure 5, the sources do not indicate that any prominent North Dakota political leaders have publicly endorsed the measure. The supporters mentioned include organizations and individuals such as New Economic Frontier, led by Burleigh County commissioner and former Bismarck mayor Steve Bakken, but he is not described as a currently prominent political leader in the state legislature or executive offices.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as the sources provided do not specify endorsements from prominent current political leaders.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the economic success of marijuana legalization in other states influenced opinions in North Dakota?\nANSWER: Yes, the economic success of marijuana legalization in other states has influenced opinions in North Dakota.\n\nThe campaigns and supporters of Measure 5 in North Dakota frequently cite the economic benefits observed in neighboring states, such as Montana, which generated over $118 million in tax revenue within two years of legalization. This is used as an example to highlight the potential economic gains for North Dakota if they were to legalize adult-use cannabis.\n\nThe New Economic Frontier campaign emphasizes that by legalizing cannabis, North Dakota could capture significant tax revenue, create new jobs, stimulate tourism, and support local economic growth, mirroring the successes seen in other states that have already legalized cannabis.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are recent polls indicating majority support among North Dakota voters for legalizing recreational marijuana?\nANSWER: The available sources do not provide clear and recent polling data that definitively indicates majority support among North Dakota voters for legalizing recreational marijuana.\n\n- While there are mentions of previous rejections of marijuana legalization initiatives in 2018 and 2022, and the current initiative being on the ballot, there is no specific recent polling data provided in the sources that shows a majority in favor of legalization.\n- The only mention of a poll is from the Brighter Future Alliance in 2024, but it does not specify the level of support for the current initiative.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have neighboring states of North Dakota legalized recreational marijuana?\nANSWER: No, the neighboring states of North Dakota have not all legalized recreational marijuana, although some neighboring regions have.\n\n- South Dakota: While South Dakota has had initiatives to legalize recreational marijuana, they have not been successful as of the latest information. However, medical marijuana is legal in South Dakota.\n- Montana: Not mentioned in the provided sources, but Montana has legalized recreational marijuana.\n- Minnesota: Minnesota has not legalized recreational marijuana at the state level as of the latest information, though there are ongoing efforts.\n- Canada: While Canada has legalized recreational marijuana nationwide, it is not a U.S. state.\n\nSo, while some neighboring regions or states may have legalized recreational marijuana, not all of North Dakota's neighboring U.S. states have done so. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has public opinion in North Dakota shifted favorably towards marijuana legalization in recent years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are indications that public opinion in North Dakota may be shifting, though it is not a unanimous or clear-cut shift.\n\n- The initiative to legalize recreational marijuana has made it to the ballot for the third time, suggesting ongoing efforts and some level of public support.\n- Public support for marijuana legalization has increased nationwide, and North Dakota is surrounded by states where marijuana is legalized, which could influence local opinions.\n- The fact that the measure is on the presidential election ballot, which typically sees higher turnout, might improve its odds of passage, implying that there could be more favorable sentiment among voters this time around.\n\nHowever, there is still significant opposition from various groups, including law enforcement, medical professionals, and the Catholic bishops, which indicates that public opinion is not uniformly in favor of legalization.\n\nTherefore, while there are signs of increasing support, it is not conclusive that public opinion has shifted favorably across the board.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are 5 days left until the November 5, 2024, general election when North Dakota voters will decide on Initiated Measure 5.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, the measure would likely be rejected by the voters, based on historical voting patterns and current opposition.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately 1 day left, my forecast would remain the same, possibly with slightly increased confidence due to the minimal time for any significant shifts in public opinion.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nWith about 20 days remaining, there would be more opportunity for campaigns to influence voters. However, unless substantial changes occur, my forecast would remain similar, albeit with slightly higher uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nNorth Dakota voters have previously rejected similar measures to legalize recreational marijuana in 2018 and 2022. This indicates a historical reluctance to approve recreational marijuana initiatives. Significant opposition exists from influential organizations such as the North Dakota Medical Association, law enforcement groups, and religious organizations, including the Catholic Church. These groups highlight concerns about health risks, public safety, and societal impacts, which can sway voter opinions.\n\nThere is no clear evidence of a significant shift in public opinion favoring legalization since the last vote. Recent polls indicating majority support are not available or are inconclusive. The measure lacks public endorsements from prominent political leaders in the state, which could influence voter confidence in the initiative.\n\nWhile supporters emphasize potential economic benefits, including tax revenue and job creation observed in states like Montana, it is uncertain how much these factors influence North Dakota voters. The state's conservative stance and previous voting behavior suggest economic incentives may not override concerns about health and safety.\n\nWith only 5 days until the election, the likelihood of substantial changes in public opinion is low. If there were more time, there might be opportunities for campaigns to alter the narrative, but significant shifts would require compelling new information or endorsements.\n\nConsidering these factors, I assess that the probability of North Dakota voters approving Initiated Measure 5 is relatively low but acknowledges some chance of approval due to potential shifts in voter sentiment and the influence of national trends.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 30%**",
