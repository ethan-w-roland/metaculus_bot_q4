    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Federal Register list 1 or 2 executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024? \n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-18\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Federal Register, which can be accessed [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2024), lists 1 or 2 executive orders for President Joe Biden for the month of December 2024. If it lists >0, this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Joe Biden's executive orders and actions](https://ballotpedia.org/Joe_Biden%27s_executive_orders_and_actions)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the Federal Register will list 1 or 2 executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Data and Trends\n- As of the current data, President Joe Biden has signed 13 executive orders in 2024, from EO 14115 through EO 14127. However, this information does not specify the distribution of these orders throughout the year[4].\n\n## Publication Process\n- The Federal Register publishes executive orders as they are signed by the President. The publication is managed by the Office of the Federal Register, which is part of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)[5].\n\n## Predictive Factors\n- The frequency and timing of executive orders can be influenced by various factors, including legislative priorities, administrative needs, and external events. However, without specific information on the President's schedule or upcoming policy initiatives, it is difficult to predict the exact number of executive orders for a given month.\n\n## Current State of Information\n- The sources provided do not offer real-time or future data on executive orders beyond what has already been published. Therefore, predicting the exact number of executive orders for December 2024 is not feasible with the current information.\n\nGiven these points, it is not possible to clearly answer whether the Federal Register will list 1 or 2 executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024 based on the available information. The prediction would require additional data or insights into future presidential actions.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is President Joe Biden expected to leave office in January 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, President Joe Biden is expected to leave office in January 2025. This is indicated by multiple sources, including the timeline of his presidency which states that his term will end on January 20, 2025, and he will be succeeded by Donald Trump[3][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the holiday season typically impact the number of executive orders issued by the president?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not offer any direct information or analysis on whether the holiday season typically impacts the number of executive orders issued by the president. They focus primarily on the specific instances of presidents granting federal employees time off around Christmas and the legal and administrative aspects of such decisions.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the holiday season typically impacts the number of executive orders issued by the president is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did President Joe Biden win the 2024 presidential election in November?\nANSWER: NO\n\nPresident Joe Biden did not win the 2024 presidential election. He initially ran for re-election but withdrew from the race on July 21, 2024, and the Democratic Party's ticket ultimately consisted of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, who lost to Donald Trump and JD Vance[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden's rate of issuing executive orders decreased in recent months of 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, President Joe Biden's rate of issuing executive orders has decreased in the recent months of 2024. Since announcing his decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race on July 21, Biden has signed only two executive orders, which is a significantly lower rate compared to his predecessors at a similar point in their presidencies[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a historical trend of U.S. presidents issuing fewer executive orders in December?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically address the trend of executive order issuance by U.S. presidents in the month of December. They discuss the overall history, frequency, and types of executive orders issued by various presidents, but they do not break down the data by month.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any planned policy initiatives announced that would result in executive orders in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about planned policy initiatives or executive orders that are scheduled to be announced or implemented in December 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss current and past executive orders, as well as potential policy priorities for the upcoming Trump administration, but they do not specify any initiatives set for December 2024[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden issued more than 2 executive orders in any month during 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information detailing the number of executive orders issued by President Joe Biden in any month of 2024. The sources discuss executive orders and actions taken in 2021 and earlier, as well as future potential actions, but they do not provide a monthly breakdown of executive orders for 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did President Joe Biden issue exactly 1 or 2 executive orders in December 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that President Joe Biden issued at least one executive order in December 2023.\n\n1. An executive order on December 22, 2023, related to the Russian Federationâ€™s harmful activities and extending the relief provided by the original proclamation on marijuana possession[1][4].\n\nThere is no mention of a second executive order specifically issued in December 2023 in the sources provided. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** if he issued exactly two, but it is confirmed that he issued at least one.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average number of executive orders issued per month by President Joe Biden in 2024 greater than 2?\nANSWER: To determine if the average number of executive orders issued per month by President Joe Biden in 2024 is greater than 2, we need to examine the available data on his executive orders for 2024.\n\nFrom the sources provided, here are some key points:\n\n- As of the latest updates, President Biden has issued several executive orders in 2024, but the exact total for the entire year is not provided in the sources.\n- However, we can look at the specific executive orders mentioned for 2024. For example, the source from the American Presidency Project lists several executive orders issued in 2024, but it does not provide a comprehensive total for the year[3].\n\nGiven the lack of a comprehensive total for 2024, we cannot accurately calculate the average number of executive orders per month for the entire year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden historically issued fewer executive orders in December compared to other months?\nANSWER: To determine if President Joe Biden has historically issued fewer executive orders in December compared to other months, we need to analyze the distribution of his executive orders over time.\n\nWhile the sources provided do not offer a detailed monthly breakdown of President Biden's executive orders, we can look at the cumulative list of his executive actions to make an educated inference.\n\n- The list of executive orders on Wikipedia[5] provides the dates for each executive order signed by President Biden, but it does not categorize them by month in a way that allows for a quick comparison.\n- However, given the extensive list of executive orders and their dates, one would need to manually count the orders issued in each month to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nWithout a detailed monthly breakdown or specific data on the number of executive orders issued in December versus other months, it is not possible to definitively answer whether President Biden has issued fewer executive orders in December.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of today's date, November 18, 2024, there are approximately 1.5 months until the outcome is determined. The executive orders for December 2024 will be listed in the Federal Register, typically within days of their issuance. The question will resolve shortly after December, likely by early January 2025.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf President Joe Biden continues his recent trend of issuing few executive orders, and no unexpected events occur, it is likely that he would issue zero executive orders in December 2024. Therefore, the Federal Register would list zero executive orders for that month, and the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only about two weeks left, the probability of President Biden issuing 1 or 2 executive orders would slightly decrease. The shortened timeframe reduces the likelihood of new policy initiatives or responses to emergent events that might prompt executive action. The forecast might lean toward a **45%** chance of issuing 1 or 2 executive orders.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were six months until December 2024, President Biden would have more time to potentially develop and implement policy initiatives requiring executive orders. However, since his term ends on January 20, 2025, and he is not seeking re-election, the additional time would not increase his likelihood of issuing executive orders in December. Thus, the forecast remains largely unchanged, maintaining around a **50%** chance.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nPresident Joe Biden is approaching the end of his term, with his presidency concluding on January 20, 2025. Since announcing his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race on July 21, 2024, his rate of issuing executive orders has decreased significantly, with only two executive orders signed since that date. This suggests a reduced propensity to use executive orders as a policy tool in his remaining time.\n\nHowever, it's common for outgoing presidents to issue executive orders during their final months in office, either to solidify their policy legacies or address last-minute priorities. While there are no specific policy initiatives announced for December 2024, unforeseen events or desires to enact last-minute changes could prompt executive action.\n\nUsing a Poisson distribution to model the issuance of executive orders, and based on President Biden's recent average rate of 0.5 executive orders per month, the probabilities are approximately:\n\n- **0 executive orders:** 60%\n- **1 executive order:** 30%\n- **2 executive orders:** 8%\n- **More than 2 executive orders:** 2%\n\nConsidering the potential for an uptick in executive activity during the final month of his presidency, the average rate might increase slightly. Adjusting the expected rate to 0.8 executive orders for December, the probabilities become:\n\n- **0 executive orders:** 45%\n- **1 executive order:** 36%\n- **2 executive orders:** 14%\n- **More than 2 executive orders:** 5%\n\nAdding the probabilities for exactly 1 or 2 executive orders gives us approximately a **50%** chance that the Federal Register will list 1 or 2 executive orders by President Biden for December 2024.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 50%**",
