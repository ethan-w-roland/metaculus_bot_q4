    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill China's youth unemployment rate be greater than 19.0 for October 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-07\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve based on the youth unemployment rate for October 2024, as reported by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/youth-unemployment-rate), using data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe youth unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force aged 16-24 without work but available for and seeking employment, based on the calculation method used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China as of August 2024.\r\n\r\nIf the National Bureau of Statistics of China revises its calculation method or age range for the youth unemployment rate before September 2024, the question will be resolved using the most up-to-date definition and methodology.\r\n\r\nIn the event that Trading Economics does not report the youth unemployment rate for August 2024 before October 7, 2024, or if the data is not available from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the question will resolve as \"Annulled\". The data can be found [directly from the NBS here](https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=A01) by selecting \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate\" under \"Indicators\" on the left side and observing the data in the row labeled \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate of the Population Aged from 16 to 24 Excluding Students(%)\".\n\nBACKGROUND:\nChina's youth unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people aged 16 to 24 who are not in school and are unemployed, has been a growing concern for the country's policymakers and economists. In July 2024, the rate [soared to 17.1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/chinas-youth-unemployment-soars-above-17percent-in-july.html), the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December 2023.\r\n\r\nThe new calculation method, introduced in late 2023, excludes those who are still in school, as more people in China are pursuing higher education amid a more competitive job market. Under the previous calculation method, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023.\r\n\r\nThe rising youth unemployment rate has been attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes in the labor market. As the issue continues to draw attention, this question aims to predict the youth unemployment rate for August 2024, providing insight into the short-term trajectory of this critical economic indicator.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of China's youth unemployment rate exceeding 19.0% in October 2024, here are some key points and context that can help inform the prediction:\n\n## Current Trends\n- The youth unemployment rate in China has been rising, with the rate for 16- to 24-year-olds not in school increasing to 18.8% in August 2024, up from 17.1% in July and 13.2% in June.\n\n## Historical Context\n- The youth unemployment rate had previously hit a record high of 21.3% in June 2023 before the government suspended and then revised the reporting methodology to exclude students.\n\n## Economic Conditions\n- China's economy is facing significant challenges, including a slowdown in key sectors such as real estate, finance, and IT, which are traditionally major employers of young graduates. This economic slowdown and restrictive hiring policies are contributing to the high youth unemployment rates.\n\n## Labor Market Dynamics\n- The labor market is highly competitive, with over 12 million university graduates entering the job market annually, far exceeding the available job opportunities. This surplus of graduates, many of whom lack the technical skills desired by employers, exacerbates the unemployment issue.\n\n## Policy and Government Response\n- Despite measures to support the economy, such as stimulus packages and calls for job creation, analysts believe that more needs to be done to address the unemployment issue effectively. The government has also encouraged young graduates to consider non-traditional jobs and return to rural areas.\n\n## Methodological Changes\n- The National Bureau of Statistics has changed its methodology to exclude students, which has affected the reported unemployment rates. However, this change does not necessarily reflect the true scale of unemployment among young people.\n\n## Social and Economic Implications\n- High youth unemployment rates can have long-term effects on individuals' lifetime earnings, skill accumulation, and career development. It also poses social stability risks due to potential discontent among young workers.\n\nGiven these factors, while the exact rate for October 2024 cannot be predicted with certainty, the following points suggest that the rate could potentially remain high or even increase:\n\n- The ongoing economic challenges and the large number of graduates entering the job market each year.\n- The recent trend of increasing youth unemployment rates.\n- The structural issues in the labor market, including the mismatch between the skills of graduates and the demands of employers.\n\nHowever, without specific data for October 2024, it is not possible to definitively say whether the rate will exceed 19.0%. The answer to this question is not immediately clear based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the National Bureau of Statistics of China changed its methodology for calculating youth unemployment in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics of China has changed its methodology for calculating youth unemployment. This change was made to exclude students from the calculation, which was implemented in January 2024 or effective from the data released in December 2023.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China's youth unemployment rate exceeded 19.0% at any time before October 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, China's youth unemployment rate has exceeded 19.0% at some points before October 2024.\n\n- The youth unemployment rate in China hit a record high of 21.3% in June 2023, which is well above 19.0%.\n- Additionally, the rate was 18.8% in August 2024, but the record high in June 2023 confirms that it has indeed exceeded 19.0%.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is China's youth unemployment rate on an upward trend according to the latest available data?\nANSWER: Based on the latest available data, the trend of China's youth unemployment rate is not consistently upward. Here are the key points:\n\n- The youth unemployment rate rose to 18.8% in August, which was the highest since the new record-keeping system was implemented.\n- However, in September 2024, the youth unemployment rate decreased to 17.6% from the August high of 18.8%.\n\nTherefore, the latest data indicates a slight decrease in the youth unemployment rate after it reached a peak in August.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as the trend is not consistently upward based on the latest data).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the number of university graduates entering the job market expected to increase in 2024?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not indicate an expectation of an increase in the number of university graduates entering the job market in 2024. Instead, they highlight various challenges and a decline in job prospects for new graduates.\n\n- The hiring rate for fresh graduates is predicted to decrease by 6% compared to the previous year.\n- Only 13% of entry-level job seekers successfully landed a job in the first six months of 2024, a significant decline from previous years.\n- The unemployment rate for recent college graduates has increased, and the overall job market for them is described as challenging and competitive.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are economic forecasts predicting a slowdown in China's economy leading up to October 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, economic forecasts are predicting a slowdown in China's economy leading up to October 2024.\n\n- The World Bank estimates that China's GDP growth rate will slow down to 4.3% in 2025 from a projected 4.8% in 2024, indicating a continued slowdown.\n- China's GDP growth in the third quarter of 2024 was 4.6%, which is the slowest pace since early last year and below the government's annual target of 5%.\n- The slowdown is attributed to various factors including weakness in the real estate market, low consumer and investor confidence, an aging population, and global tensions.\n\nThese indicators suggest that the economic forecasts do predict a slowdown in China's economy.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are international trade tensions affecting China's economy adversely in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, international trade tensions are affecting China's economy adversely in 2024. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The Biden administration's new tariffs on Chinese imports, announced in May 2024, are expected to raise costs and potentially disrupt supply chains, which could have adverse effects on China's economy.\n- Trade disputes, tariffs, and escalating tensions are identified as factors that raise geopolitical risks and harm China's economic growth. These tensions have led to decreased exports and weakened demand from key markets such as Europe.\n- China's economic recovery is described as uneven, with trade restrictions and overcapacity issues contributing to its economic slowdown. The country's reliance on external demand is shrinking due to increasing trade tensions.\n- The global economic forecasts indicate that China's growth is expected to be the slowest since 1990, excluding the COVID-19 era, partly due to trade tensions and other external pressures.\n\nThese points collectively suggest that international trade tensions are indeed having an adverse impact on China's economy in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the COVID-19 pandemic continued to negatively impact China's economy in 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had lasting impacts on China's economy that are still evident in 2024. Here are some key points:\n\n- The pandemic's severe public health policies, such as the \"zero-COVID\" policy, significantly disrupted the economy, and even after the policy was lifted, the economic recovery has been slow and uneven.\n- Despite the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, consumer confidence remains low, and consumption has not rebounded as anticipated, continuing to hamper economic growth in 2024.\n- The real estate market, which was heavily impacted by the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, remains in a downturn, affecting overall economic growth.\n- The pandemic exacerbated existing structural and cyclical challenges in the Chinese economy, including a slowdown in exports, investments, and a broader economic slowdown that persists in 2024.\n\nThese factors indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a negative impact on China's economy in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are key industries that employ young workers in China experiencing contraction or layoffs in 2024?\nANSWER: The information available suggests that while there are challenges in the job market for young workers in China, not all key industries are experiencing contraction or layoffs in 2024.\n\n### Positive Trends\n- There is a surge in demand for technology professionals and skilled workers, with industries like advanced manufacturing, digital economy, and high-tech sectors creating new job opportunities.\n- The services sector, including transportation, logistics, catering, and tourism, has seen increased recruitment.\n- Blue-collar jobs have also seen a significant surge in demand and wages.\n- New industries such as artificial intelligence, big data, smart manufacturing, and new energy are generating new job opportunities.\n\n### Challenges\n- Regulatory burdens are dampening growth in industries that typically employ young people, such as technology.\n- The general economic downturn and the collapse of the property and housing market have led to a hiring slowdown in some sectors.\n- Despite these challenges, the overall employment situation is described as \"largely stable\" with growth in certain sectors.\n\nGiven this mixed picture, it is not accurate to say that all key industries are experiencing contraction or layoffs. Instead, there are both positive and negative trends depending on the sector.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Chinese government implemented significant measures to reduce youth unemployment before October 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe Chinese government has implemented several significant measures to address youth unemployment before October 2024. Here are some of the key initiatives:\n\n- A 24-point plan was issued by the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to promote high-quality and full employment. This plan includes measures such as pushing universities to scrap programs with “low employment quality,” assessing new project bids based on job creation potential, and requiring companies to invest more in staff training.\n\n- Policies to encourage employers to hire fresh college graduates and registered unemployed youth, including a one-time allowance for employers who sign contracts with these individuals.\n\n- Streamlined administrative procedures and special employment allowances to incentivize hiring of young people. Additionally, campaigns were launched to find jobs for college graduates and job seekers, including career guidance sessions, job recommendations, and skill training courses or internships.\n\n- Subsidies for college graduates who have not found a job within two years of graduation to help them pay for social insurance, a policy continued from 2019.\n\n- Improvements in tax incentives for businesses to hire unpaid interns, expansion of recruitment quotas for the civil service, and elevated status and increased funding for vocational schools.\n\nThese measures indicate a comprehensive effort by the Chinese government to tackle the issue of youth unemployment.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of underreporting of unemployment figures by Chinese authorities in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there is evidence suggesting the potential underreporting or manipulation of unemployment figures by Chinese authorities in 2024.\n\n1. **Methodology Change**: The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) changed its methodology to exclude students from the unemployment calculation, which resulted in a significant drop in the reported youth unemployment rate. This change has been questioned by analysts, who argue that it does not accurately reflect the employment and unemployment situation of young people entering the workforce.\n\n2. **Expert Criticism**: Economists like Louise Loo from Oxford Economics have estimated that the actual jobless rate for the 16-24 age group could be higher than the reported figures, suggesting that the new statistic may grossly undermine the associated social and economic risks of youth unemployment.\n\n3. **Historical Context**: There is a history of concerns over the transparency and accuracy of China's economic data, including youth unemployment figures. The suspension of data release in the past and the reintroduction with a new methodology have raised suspicions about data manipulation.\n\n4. **General Data Reliability Issues**: The trustworthiness of China's economic data is a topic of ongoing debate among analysts and economists. There are concerns about deliberate data falsification by local governments and the smoothing out of data series to minimize dramatic drops and rises.\n\nThese points collectively indicate that there is evidence to suggest underreporting or manipulation of unemployment figures by Chinese authorities in 2024.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of **November 7, 2024**, the official youth unemployment rate for **October 2024** is expected to be released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) within this month or early next month. Therefore, the time left until the outcome is known is approximately **1 month or less**.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nBased on the latest data available up to my knowledge cutoff in **October 2023**, China's youth unemployment rate had reached **record highs** and was a significant concern. If the economic conditions, policy responses, and labor market trends remained unchanged from those known up to October 2023, it is likely that the youth unemployment rate for October 2024 would be **greater than 19.0%**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only **three months** remaining until October 2024 (i.e., it's currently July 2024), and considering the trends known up to October 2023, I would forecast a **high probability** that the youth unemployment rate would be **greater than 19.0%** in October 2024.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were **48 months** remaining until the outcome is known (extending the timeframe to October 2028), there would be more time for economic conditions to change significantly. In that scenario, I would forecast a **moderate probability** that the youth unemployment rate would be **greater than 19.0%** in October 2024, as long-term economic policies and recovery efforts could reduce unemployment.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Historical Trends up to October 2023:**\n   - The youth unemployment rate in China reached a record high of **21.3% in June 2023** under the previous calculation method.\n   - In response to rising unemployment figures, the **National Bureau of Statistics of China** changed its methodology to exclude students, resulting in a reported reduction in the unemployment rate. However, this did not necessarily reflect an actual improvement in employment conditions.\n\n2. **Economic Challenges:**\n   - **Economic Slowdown:** China's economy faced slow growth due to factors like the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, a weakening real estate sector, and global economic uncertainties.\n   - **Labor Market Mismatch:** An oversupply of university graduates relative to available skilled jobs contributed to high youth unemployment.\n   - **Structural Issues:** Key industries such as technology and real estate experienced regulatory crackdowns and financial difficulties, leading to reduced hiring.\n\n3. **Policy Responses:**\n   - The Chinese government implemented measures to address youth unemployment, including subsidies for employers hiring recent graduates, promoting vocational training, and encouraging entrepreneurship. However, the effectiveness of these measures remained uncertain up to October 2023.\n   - The change in unemployment calculation methodology suggested an attempt to manage public perception rather than address underlying issues.\n\n4. **Likelihood for October 2024:**\n   - Given the persistent economic challenges and structural issues in the labor market, it is plausible that youth unemployment remained elevated through October 2024.\n   - Without significant economic recovery or effective policy interventions known up to my knowledge cutoff, the unemployment rate likely exceeded **19.0%**.\n\n5. **Consideration of Uncertainties:**\n   - Since my knowledge is current up to **October 2023**, I cannot account for developments beyond that date, such as new policy measures, unexpected economic shifts, or global events that could impact China's economy and labor market.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**Probability: 70%**",
