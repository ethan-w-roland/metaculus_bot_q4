    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS exceed 3.0M for November 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which can be access through [this link](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view), shows greater than 3,000,000 background check initiated in November 2024. If the number is less than or equal to 3,000,000, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNumbers are expected to be reported in the month subsequent, so for example October numbers are expected to be reported in November. In case of reporting delays, resolution will wait, until the question will be annulled in early January 2025 if there are no numbers reported by then for the time in question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn the long term (since the turn of the 21st Century), firearms sales in the US have risen, surging in 2020, with numbers trending downward since. Starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers have again begun trending upward.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) will exceed 3.0 million for November 2024, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Historical Trends\n- The number of NICS background checks has been consistently high over the past few years. For example, September 2024 marked the 62nd consecutive month with over 1 million background checks[3][4].\n- In recent months, the adjusted NICS figures have shown year-over-year increases, although at a moderate pace. For instance, September 2024 saw a 1.3% increase over September 2023[3][4].\n\n## Monthly Averages\n- The third quarter of 2024 had an NSSF-adjusted NICS figure of 3,432,008, which averages to about 1.144 million checks per month[3][4].\n- Historically, monthly figures have often exceeded 1 million, but reaching 3 million in a single month is unusual. For example, in August 2024, the unadjusted FBI NICS figure was 2,163,540, and the adjusted figure was 1,210,995[2][4].\n\n## Seasonal and Event-Driven Factors\n- Background checks can surge during periods of social and political unrest or before significant events like presidential elections. However, the current trend does not indicate a surge to the level seen in 2020[2][3].\n\n## Adjusted vs. Unadjusted Figures\n- The NSSF-adjusted figures, which subtract out permit checks and rechecks, provide a more accurate reflection of firearm sales activity. These figures have been around 1-1.2 million per month in recent times[2][3][4].\n\nGiven these points, while the number of background checks has been consistently high, exceeding 3 million in a single month (November 2024) seems unlikely based on recent trends and historical data. However, this cannot be definitively ruled out without considering specific events or changes in the current environment that could drive an unusual increase.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe question of whether the number of FBI firearms background checks will exceed 3.0 million for November 2024 cannot be clearly answered as yes or no based on the available information. The historical and recent trends suggest it is unlikely, but there is no definitive evidence to rule it out entirely.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the FBI report more than 3.0 million NICS background checks in October 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nAccording to the sources, the FBI reported 2,298,383 unadjusted NICS background checks for October 2024, which is less than 3.0 million[1][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there any significant changes in firearm legislation enacted in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any significant changes in firearm legislation that were enacted specifically in November 2024. The sources discuss various changes and legislation that were enacted or proposed in different months and years, but none of them specify November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are all components of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System functioning normally in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information regarding the operational status of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) for November 2024. The sources provide historical data and general information about the NICS system, but they do not include real-time or current status updates.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether all components of the NICS are functioning normally in November 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is November historically a month with higher than average NICS background checks?\nANSWER: Yes, November is historically a month with higher than average NICS background checks.\n\nSeveral sources indicate that November tends to see an increase in NICS background checks. For example, the data from the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) shows that November is one of the stronger months for firearm sales, often driven by holiday sales and the approach of hunting seasons[2][5].\n\nAdditionally, the NSSF-adjusted NICS figures for November are often among the highest of the year, reflecting a strong appetite for lawful firearm ownership during this period[2][5]. This pattern suggests that November consistently sees higher than average NICS background checks.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any large-scale marketing campaigns promoting firearm sales in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of large-scale marketing campaigns exclusively targeting November 2024 to promote firearm sales.\n\n- The sources discuss general marketing strategies and trends in the firearm industry for 2024, including the use of promotional activities, e-commerce trends, and the impact of various factors such as election years and consumer behavior[1][3][4].\n- However, they do not specify any large-scale marketing campaigns focused on November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have NICS background checks shown a month-over-month increase since July 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the relevant information:\n\n- July 2024 saw a year-over-year increase in NICS background checks, with 1,064,790 checks, a 4% increase over July 2023[1][5].\n- For August 2024, the NSSF-adjusted NICS figure was 1,210,995, which is an 8.3% increase over August 2023 and also a sequential increase from July 2024[2][3].\n\nThis indicates that there was an increase from July 2024 to August 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there reports of social or political unrest in the United States during November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there were indications and anticipations of potential social or political unrest in the United States around the 2024 presidential election, but specific reports of unrest occurring in November 2024 are limited.\n\n- The sources highlight anticipations and preparations for potential unrest, particularly around the election and its aftermath, including the electoral vote certification and the presidential inauguration[1][3][4].\n- Despite these anticipations, there is an indication that the immediate period around the election on November 5, 2024, was relatively peaceful, with extremist activity remaining quiet and no significant violence reported on election night[2].\n\nHowever, there are no specific reports in the sources provided that confirm significant social or political unrest actually occurred in November 2024. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the adjusted NICS figures for the third quarter of 2024 exceed historical monthly averages?\nANSWER: The adjusted NICS figures for the third quarter of 2024 did show an increase, but whether they exceeded historical monthly averages is not explicitly clear from the provided sources.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- The third quarter 2024 NSSF-adjusted NICS figure was 3,432,008, which represents a 4.5% increase over the third quarter 2023 figure of 3,283,571[4][5].\n- The sources mention that this is part of a trend where monthly background checks have exceeded one million since July 2019, but they do not provide a long-term historical average to compare against[5].\n\nGiven this information, it is unclear whether the third quarter 2024 figures exceeded the historical monthly averages, as the sources do not provide a comprehensive historical context for monthly averages.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did any major political events occur in November 2024 that could influence firearm purchases?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, several major political events are scheduled to occur in November 2024 that could potentially influence various aspects of society, including firearm purchases, although the direct impact on firearm purchases is not explicitly stated.\n\n1. **2024 United States Presidential Election**: Scheduled for November 5, 2024. This election could significantly impact various policies, including those related to firearms, depending on the winner and their platform[2][4][5].\n\n2. **Legislative and Gubernatorial Elections**: Along with the presidential election, there will be elections for the House of Representatives, Senate, and gubernatorial positions in several states. These elections can also influence state and federal policies, potentially affecting firearm regulations[5].\n\nGiven the potential for policy changes following these elections, it is reasonable to infer that these events could influence firearm purchases, either through changes in legislation or public perception and behavior.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a sustained increase in firearm sales in the United States since July 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there has been an increase in firearm sales in the United States in the period leading up to and including July 2024, but the sustainability of this increase beyond July needs to be examined.\n\n- July 2024 marked the 60th consecutive month where over a million firearms were sold, with a 4% increase in total firearm sales compared to July 2023[1].\n- The third quarter of 2024 (which includes July, August, and September) saw a 4.5% increase in sales-related background checks compared to the same period in 2023[2][3].\n- September 2024 also saw over 1 million firearm purchases, continuing the trend of increased sales[2][3].\n\nThese sources indicate that the increase in firearm sales has continued through the third quarter of 2024, including the months of July, August, and September.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- Approximately 1 to 1.5 months remain until the outcome is known, as background checks for November 2024 are expected to be reported by early December 2024, with a possible extension to early January 2025 in case of delays.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- If current trends continue without significant changes, the number of NICS background checks for November 2024 is unlikely to exceed 3.0 million.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- With only a quarter of the time left (i.e., immediately), the forecast would remain consistent with the current trajectory, maintaining a low probability of exceeding 3.0 million background checks.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- If there were four times the time left (which is not directly applicable to a single month's data), the forecast would still consider the improbability of a sudden surge to 3.0 million without significant external factors. Thus, the probability remains low.\n\n**Rationale:**\nBased on historical data, adjusted NICS background checks have consistently ranged between 1.0 to 1.2 million per month in recent times. While November typically experiences a higher volume due to holiday sales and the hunting season, surpassing 3.0 million checks in a single month is atypical. The current adjusted figures indicate stability, and although there has been a year-over-year increase since July 2024, it remains insufficient to reach the 3.0 million threshold.\n\nUnadjusted figures have shown higher numbers (e.g., over 2.0 million in August 2024), but these include permit checks and rechecks, which are not as indicative of new firearm acquisitions. The lack of significant changes in firearm legislation or large-scale marketing campaigns in November 2024 further diminishes the likelihood of a spike to 3.0 million checks.\n\nWhile the presidential election and potential political events can influence firearm sales, there is no clear evidence suggesting an unprecedented surge that would push the numbers beyond 3.0 million. Additionally, considerations of system functionality and market conditions do not present factors that would drastically alter the expected outcomes.\n\nTaking into account calibration, base rates, and the mechanisms driving NICS background checks, the probability remains low for exceeding the 3.0 million mark in November 2024.\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
