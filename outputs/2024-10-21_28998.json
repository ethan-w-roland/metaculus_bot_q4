{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill a nuclear weapon be detonated as an act of war before January 1, 2025?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if there is any nuclear detonation as an act of war before January 1, 2025.  Resolution will be by credible media reports. The detonation must be deliberate; accidental, inadvertent, or testing/peaceful detonations will not qualify (see fine print). Attacks using [strategic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_nuclear_weapon) and [tactical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_nuclear_weapon) nuclear weapons are both sufficient to qualify.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n[Barrett et al. 2013](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs21barrett.pdf) defined terms to distinguish between causes of nuclear detonations:\n\n>In an accidental or unauthorized launch or detonation, system safeguards or procedures to maintain control over nuclear weapons fail in such a way that a nuclear weapon or missile launches or explodes without direction from leaders.\n\n>In an inadvertent detonation, the attacking nation mistakenly concludes that it is under nuclear attack and launches one or more nuclear weapons in what it believes is a counterattack.\n\n>In a deliberate detonation, the attacking nation decides to launch one or more nuclear weapons either in response to a genuine nuclear attack or without believing that it is under nuclear attack.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn the last 75 years, two nuclear weapons have been detonated as an act of war; the [bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki) in 1945, at the end of WWII. Despite tensions being high between the US and the USSR during the Cold War, and [several close calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_close_calls), there have been no additional nuclear weapons detonated as acts of war. \n\nCurrently, estimated nuclear weapon stockpiles are 15,000 warheads worldwide, mostly in the US and Russia, and there are eight or nine states that possess nuclear weapons (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, United States, India, North Korea, Pakistan, and [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Israel) which remains officially ambiguous). The use of these nuclear weapons [could be catastrophic](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1494/ragnar%25C3%25B6k-question-series-if-a-global-catastrophe-occurs-will-it-be-due-to-nuclear-war/).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of a nuclear weapon being detonated as an act of war before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points and background information:\n\n## Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)\nThe TPNW, which entered into force on January 22, 2021, prohibits the development, testing, production, acquisition, possession, stockpiling, use, or threat of use of nuclear weapons. However, it is important to note that none of the nuclear-armed states have signed or ratified this treaty, and many have expressed opposition to it.\n\n## Historical Context and Current State\nHistorically, there have been no nuclear detonations in acts of war since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 was a close call, but it did not result in any nuclear detonations. Recent years have seen increased tensions between nuclear-armed states, but no nuclear weapons have been used in conflict.\n\n## Geopolitical Tensions\nCurrent geopolitical tensions, particularly between nations like the United States, Russia, India, and Pakistan, remain high. However, despite these tensions, there has been no recent instance of a nuclear weapon being detonated in an act of war. The expansion of nuclear arsenals in countries like India and Pakistan increases the risk, but it does not guarantee an event.\n\n## Base Rates\nThe base rate for nuclear detonations in acts of war is extremely low. Since 1945, there have been no instances of nuclear weapons being used in conflict, despite several close calls and ongoing nuclear proliferation.\n\n## International Efforts\nInternational efforts, such as the TPNW and other disarmament initiatives, aim to reduce the risk of nuclear war. However, the effectiveness of these efforts is limited by the lack of participation from nuclear-armed states.\n\n## Community Predictions\nCommunity predictions on platforms like Metaculus indicate a low probability of a nuclear detonation in an act of war. For example, a question about whether there would be any non-test nuclear detonations by January 1, 2024, resolved as \"Yes\" (meaning no such detonations occurred), with a community prediction of 99%.\n\nGiven this information, while it is impossible to rule out the possibility entirely, the historical base rate and current international efforts suggest that the likelihood of a nuclear weapon being detonated as an act of war before January 1, 2025, is relatively low. However, this does not mean it is impossible, and ongoing geopolitical tensions and the expansion of nuclear arsenals are factors that need to be considered.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any nuclear-armed states signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons?\nANSWER: No, none of the nuclear-armed states have signed the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). The sources consistently indicate that nuclear-armed states did not participate in the negotiations and have not joined the treaty.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any reported failures in nuclear command and control systems in nuclear-armed states as of October 21, 2024?\nANSWER: As of October 21, 2024, there are no reported failures in nuclear command and control systems in nuclear-armed states mentioned in the provided sources. The sources discuss potential vulnerabilities, modernization efforts, and the need for hardening against various threats, but they do not report any actual failures of these systems.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an active international arms control treaty in effect that restricts the use of nuclear weapons as of October 21, 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nAs of October 21, 2024, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is in effect. It entered into force on January 22, 2021, after the 50th instrument of ratification was deposited, and it prohibits the use, possession, testing, and transfer of nuclear weapons among other activities.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any accidental or unauthorized launches of nuclear weapons systems since January 1, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any accidental or unauthorized launches of nuclear weapons systems since January 1, 2024. The sources discuss various aspects of nuclear disarmament, treaty implementations, and international concerns about nuclear weapons, but they do not report any incidents of accidental or unauthorized nuclear launches in 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any recent increase in nuclear weapon stockpiles by a nuclear-armed state since January 1, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there has been no reported increase in nuclear weapon stockpiles by any nuclear-armed state since January 1, 2024. The sources provide data up to January 2024, but do not mention any increases after that date.\n\n- The SIPRI reports and other sources discuss the state of nuclear arsenals as of January 2024, noting increases in the number of warheads and modernization efforts up to that point, but they do not provide information on changes after January 1, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any leader of a nuclear-armed state publicly declared an intention to use nuclear weapons before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there have been instances where leaders of nuclear-armed states have hinted at or threatened the use of nuclear weapons, but these do not constitute a direct public declaration of an intention to use them.\n\n- Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly hinted at Russia\u2019s willingness to use nuclear weapons, particularly during the conflict in Ukraine. However, he has not explicitly declared an intention to use them.\n- There have been no reports in the sources provided of any other leader of a nuclear-armed state making a public declaration of an intention to use nuclear weapons before January 1, 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any non-nuclear-armed states taken actions that could escalate to nuclear conflict in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence that non-nuclear-armed states have taken actions that could directly escalate to nuclear conflict in 2024.\n\nThe sources primarily discuss the actions and rhetoric of nuclear-armed states, particularly Russia, and the concerns raised by these actions. For example, Russia's revision of its nuclear doctrine and the threats made by President Putin are extensively discussed.\n\nThere is no mention of specific actions by non-nuclear-armed states that could lead to a nuclear conflict. The focus is on the nuclear-armed states and their interactions, as well as the broader international community's concerns about nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there ongoing military conflicts between any nuclear-armed states as of October 21, 2024?\nANSWER: As of October 21, 2024, there are no direct military conflicts between nuclear-armed states themselves, but there are conflicts involving states with nuclear capabilities and their allies or proxies.\n\n- The primary conflict mentioned is the ongoing war in Ukraine, which involves Russia (a nuclear-armed state) and Ukraine, with significant international implications and involvement from other countries, including the supply of weapons from North Korea and Iran to Russia.\n- There are also tensions and conflicts in other regions, such as the Middle East, involving Israel and various non-state actors supported by Iran, but these do not constitute direct conflicts between nuclear-armed states.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (since the conflicts do not directly involve nuclear-armed states fighting each other, but do involve nuclear-armed states in various capacities).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any nuclear-armed states issued credible threats to use nuclear weapons since January 1, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, nuclear-armed states, particularly Russia, have issued credible threats to use nuclear weapons since January 1, 2024.\n\n- President Vladimir Putin has made several statements and adjustments to Russia's nuclear policy, including threats to use nuclear weapons in response to conventional attacks that pose a \"critical threat to our sovereignty\" or if a non-nuclear state, backed by a nuclear power, attacks Russia.\n- In May 2024, Russia carried out tactical nuclear weapon drills close to the Ukrainian border, and Putin has repeatedly emphasized the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the context of Western support for Ukraine.\n- Putin's recent declarations have included specifying new conditions under which Russia might use nuclear weapons, such as attacks that pose an \"existential threat\" to Russia or if a nuclear power supports a non-nuclear state in conventional attacks inside Russia.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been significant geopolitical events in 2024 that increase tensions between nuclear-armed states?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been significant geopolitical events in 2024 that have increased tensions between nuclear-armed states.\n\n- Russia has continued to escalate its nuclear rhetoric and actions, including tactical nuclear weapon drills close to the Ukrainian border in May and stationing nuclear weapons in Belarus. Russia has also withdrawn from several arms control agreements, such as the New START treaty, and has threatened the use of strategic nuclear weapons against the West.\n\n- The conflict in Ukraine and the involvement of other nuclear-armed states have heightened the risk of nuclear use. Russia's cooperation with North Korea and other nations has added complexity to the geopolitical landscape and increased the potential for escalation.\n\n- The erosion of disarmament frameworks, such as the failure to reach consensus in recent Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conferences, and the lack of progress in reducing nuclear arsenals have contributed to rising tensions.\n\n- China's opaque nuclear buildup and North Korea's increasing nuclear and ballistic missile programs have also been highlighted as significant concerns, further straining international relations among nuclear-armed states.\n\nThese developments indicate a marked increase in geopolitical tensions involving nuclear-armed states in 2024.", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 72 days.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions persist without any significant changes, it is unlikely that a nuclear weapon will be detonated as an act of war before January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 18 days remaining, the probability of a nuclear detonation as an act of war would remain extremely low, possibly around 1%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith around 288 days until the resolution date, the probability might increase modestly due to the extended timeframe for geopolitical tensions to escalate, estimated at approximately 7%.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAssessing the probability of a nuclear weapon being detonated as an act of war before January 1, 2025, involves considering historical precedents, current geopolitical tensions, and the mechanisms that could lead to such an event.\n\n1. **Historical Context and Base Rates:**  \n   Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, there have been no nuclear detonations as acts of war. The base rate for such events is exceptionally low, spanning over 75 years with only two occurrences.\n\n2. **Current Geopolitical Tensions:**  \n   Recent developments indicate heightened tensions, particularly involving Russia's aggressive posturing and credible threats related to the conflict in Ukraine. Russia's nuclear rhetoric and tactical drills increase the risk, albeit marginally.\n\n3. **Nuclear-Armed States' Behavior:**  \n   While nuclear-armed states like Russia have issued credible threats, there is no direct conflict between nuclear-armed nations. Most tensions involve nuclear-armed states interacting with non-nuclear states or their proxies.\n\n4. **International Treaties and Efforts:**  \n   The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) is in effect, but none of the nuclear-armed states are signatories. Existing arms control agreements have seen erosion, such as Russia's withdrawal from the New START treaty, which diminishes collaborative restraint measures.\n\n5. **Command and Control Systems:**  \n   As of the current date, there have been no reported failures in nuclear command and control systems, reducing the likelihood of accidental detonations.\n\n6. **Community Predictions:**  \n   Platforms like Metaculus have historically predicted low probabilities for such events, reinforcing the assessment of a minimal but non-negligible risk given current tensions.\n\n7. **Timeframe Considerations:**  \n   - **Short-Term (18 days):** Limited time reduces the window for escalation, maintaining a very low probability.\n   - **Extended-Term (288 days):** A longer period allows for more developments and potential escalations, slightly increasing the risk but still keeping it relatively low.\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**Probability: 5%**", "probability": 5}
