    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Kamala Harris be president before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Kamala Harris is the US President for at least 30 consecutive days at any point before January 1, 2025. Kamala Harris becoming president by winning the 2024 election is not sufficient for positive resolution.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n*Related Questions on Metaculus:*\n\n* [Will Biden be impeached by the US House of Representatives?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3419/biden-impeachment-vote-by-house-of-reps/)\n* [Will Joe Biden no longer be US President before January 20, 2025?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/12217/biden-does-not-complete-first-term/)\n\n----\n\nKamala Harris is the running mate for Joe Biden for the 2020 US election. Many believe Biden's mental health is not good and may deteriorate fast ([see this question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4906/will-an-official-diagnosis-of-dementia-be-announced-for-joe-biden-before-2023/)). This opens the question of whether he will leave office due to mental health reasons before finishing his first term. In August 2020, there was a nation-wide poll on this: [59% Think Biden Unlikely to Finish A Four-Year Term in White House](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2020/59_think_biden_unlikely_to_finish_a_four_year_term_in_white_house).\n\n>Likely Democrat nominee Joe Biden is expected to announce his vice presidential running mate any day now, and most voters think it’s likely that person will be president within the next four years if Biden is elected in November.\n\n>The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 59% of Likely U.S. Voters believe it’s likely Biden’s running mate will be president before the end of Biden’s four-year term if he wins this fall, with 39% who say it’s Very Likely. Thirty-five percent (35%) consider it unlikely that Biden’s vice presidential choice will be president before his four-year term ends, but that includes only 14% who think it’s Not At All Likely.\n\n>Even 49% of Democrats think it’s likely Biden’s vice president will become president in the next four years, although that compares to 73% of Republicans and 57% of voters not affiliated with either major party.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Kamala Harris will be president before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Role and Election Status\nAs of the current date (November 4, 2024), Kamala Harris is the Vice President of the United States and the Democratic nominee for the 2024 presidential election.\n\n## Presidential Election Timeline\nThe 2024 presidential election is scheduled to take place on November 5, 2024. If Kamala Harris wins this election, she would not take office until the inauguration on January 20, 2025.\n\n## Scenario of Biden's Incapacity\nIf President Joe Biden were to die or step down before January 20, 2025, Kamala Harris would assume the presidency immediately. However, this scenario is speculative and not currently the case.\n\n## Conclusion\nBased on the current information and assuming no extraordinary events such as the incapacitation of President Biden, Kamala Harris would not become president before January 1, 2025, unless an unexpected event occurs that leads to her assuming the office earlier.\n\nThe answer to whether she will be president before January 1, 2025, is not clearly \"yes\" based on the current status, but it could potentially be \"yes\" if specific unforeseen circumstances arise.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any US president died in office in the last 50 years?\nANSWER: NO, no U.S. president has died in office in the last 50 years. The last president to die in office was John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated on November 22, 1963.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Joe Biden currently alive as of November 4, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Joe Biden has passed away as of November 4, 2024. All the sources discuss his recent activities, political decisions, and current status without mentioning his death.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **YES**, Joe Biden is currently alive as of November 4, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any US president resigned from office in the last 50 years?\nANSWER: NO, there has not been any U.S. president who has resigned from office in the last 50 years. The only U.S. president to have resigned from office is Richard Nixon, and he did so on August 9, 1974, which is more than 50 years ago.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Joe Biden currently facing impeachment proceedings in the US House of Representatives?\nANSWER: As of the current information, Joe Biden is not currently facing active impeachment proceedings in the US House of Representatives, although an impeachment inquiry has been conducted.\n\n- The House Republicans have released a report detailing their findings from the impeachment inquiry, but they have not yet brought any articles of impeachment to a vote.\n- The inquiry was authorized and has been ongoing, but no impeachment charges have been put up for a vote.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kamala Harris ever served as acting president under the 25th Amendment for at least 30 consecutive days before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources provided do not indicate that Kamala Harris has ever served as acting president under the 25th Amendment for at least 30 consecutive days. The only instance mentioned where she assumed presidential powers was for a brief period of 1 hour and 25 minutes while President Biden was under anesthesia for a routine colonoscopy, which is far shorter than 30 days. There is no mention of any other instance where she has assumed the role of acting president for an extended period.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any current news reports indicating that Joe Biden intends to step down before the end of his term?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are no current news reports indicating that Joe Biden intends to step down as President before the end of his term. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- Biden announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race but stated that he would serve out the remainder of his term as President.\n- There are calls from Republicans for Biden to resign immediately, but these are not indications of Biden's intentions, rather criticisms and demands from his opponents.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Joe Biden currently facing any significant legal scandals that could force him to resign?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no direct evidence that Joe Biden himself is currently facing significant legal scandals that could force him to resign. The sources primarily focus on the legal and political scrutiny surrounding his son, Hunter Biden, including Hunter's convictions and plea agreements related to gun charges and tax evasion.\n\nWhile there are investigations and allegations involving the Biden family's business dealings and potential influence peddling, these do not appear to directly implicate Joe Biden in a way that would necessitate his resignation due to legal scandals.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Joe Biden currently in good mental health?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided present a complex and nuanced picture of President Joe Biden's mental health, with various perspectives and concerns but no definitive conclusion.\n\n- There are reports of Biden's poor performance in a recent debate, descriptions of mental lapses, and concerns from staff and medical professionals about his cognitive fitness.\n- Some sources highlight that Biden has good days and bad days, and his decline appears to be gradual, making it hard to determine the exact state of his mental health.\n- The White House and Biden's team have defended his ability to perform his duties, attributing some issues to temporary factors like a grueling travel schedule and a cold.\n- Medical experts have expressed concerns that his symptoms might indicate more than just typical aging effects, but they also refrain from diagnosing from a distance and emphasize the need for thorough neurological assessments.\n- Special counsel Robert Hur’s report described Biden as a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,\" which has raised significant concerns among Democrats and the public.\n\nGiven these varied and sometimes conflicting reports, it is unclear whether Joe Biden is currently in good mental health without more definitive medical evaluations or direct assessments.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Joe Biden currently in good physical health?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the key points regarding Joe Biden's physical health:\n\n- Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O’Connor, has described him as a \"healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male\" who remains fit to execute the duties of the presidency.\n- His annual physical exams have found no new health concerns, and he has been managing several age-related conditions such as sleep apnea, hyperlipidemia, seasonal allergies, spinal arthritis, and peripheral neuropathy.\n- The neurological exams conducted as part of his annual physicals have not detected any signs of Parkinson’s disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or other similar neurological conditions.\n- Biden exercises regularly, working out five times a week, although he has experienced some hip discomfort and a stiff gait due to arthritic changes in his spine.\n\nGiven these points, it can be concluded that Joe Biden is generally in good physical health, despite some age-related issues.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a significant likelihood of a person aged 81 dying within the next two months due to age-related health risks?\nANSWER: To determine the likelihood of an 81-year-old person dying within the next two months due to age-related health risks, we need to consider the available mortality data.\n\n### Yearly Probability of Dying\nAccording to the Social Security Administration's actuarial life table for 2021, an 81-year-old person has a probability of dying within one year. For an 81-year-old male, the probability of dying within one year is approximately 7.43% (based on the life expectancy and mortality rates).\n\n### Monthly Probability\nTo estimate the probability of dying within two months, we can make a rough calculation. Assuming a uniform distribution of deaths throughout the year (which is a simplification, as mortality rates can vary by month), we can calculate the monthly probability as follows:\n\n- Annual probability of dying for an 81-year-old male: 7.43%\n- Monthly probability: \\( \\frac{7.43\\%}{12} \\approx 0.62\\% \\) per month\n- Probability of dying within two months: \\( 0.62\\% \\times 2 \\approx 1.24\\% \\)\n\nFor an 81-year-old female, the annual probability of dying is slightly lower, around 8.81%, which would translate to a monthly probability of approximately \\( \\frac{8.81\\%}{12} \\approx 0.73\\% \\) per month, and a two-month probability of \\( 0.73\\% \\times 2 \\approx 1.46\\% \\).\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile these calculations provide a rough estimate, they indicate that the likelihood of an 81-year-old person dying within the next two months due to age-related health risks is relatively low, around 1.24% to 1.46%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**, there is not a significant likelihood of a person aged 81 dying within the next two months due to age-related health risks.",
    "comment": "**(a)** Time left until the outcome is known: Approximately 57 days remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b)** If nothing changed, the outcome would be that Kamala Harris does **not** become president before January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c)** If there were only a quarter of the time left (about 14 days), I would forecast an even lower probability of the question resolving as true.\n\n**(d)** If there were 4 times the time left (approximately 8 months), the probability would increase slightly but still remain low.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 4, 2024, President Joe Biden is still in office, and there are no significant indications that he intends to resign or that he is facing imminent removal from office. Historical precedents show that no U.S. president has died in office or resigned in the past 50 years. The statistical likelihood of an 81-year-old individual passing away within the next two months is relatively low (around 1-2%).\n\nPresident Biden is reported to be in generally good physical health, and while there have been concerns about his mental acuity, there is no concrete evidence suggesting he is unfit to continue his duties or plans to step down. Additionally, there are no active impeachment proceedings against him that are likely to result in his removal from office before January 1, 2025.\n\nGiven the short time frame remaining and the lack of compelling reasons to anticipate a transition of presidential power to Kamala Harris, the probability of her becoming president before January 1, 2025, is low.\n\n**Probability: 2%**",
