    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the new Prime Minister of Iceland belong to the Independence Party after the 2024 parliamentary elections?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-11\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve **Yes** if the new prime minister belongs to the Independence Party at the time of receiving the mandate to form a government by the President.\n\nIf, for any reason, no one has received the mandate before 1 January 2025 (including that the election is postponed or the coalition talks are ongoing), this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe [2017 parliamentary elections in Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Icelandic_parliamentary_election) resulted in an unusual governing coalition of the left-wing [Left-Green Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-Green_Movement), the centre [Progressive Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Iceland)), and the centre-right [Independence Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Party_(Iceland)). Despite the Independence Party being the largest party in the coalition, the new prime minister was [Katrín Jakobsdóttir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katr%C3%ADn_Jakobsd%C3%B3ttir), the chairperson of the Left-Green Movement.\n\nIn [2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Icelandic_parliamentary_election), the three-party coalition maintained its majority and remained governmend under the lead of Katrín Jakobsdóttir. However, Jakobsdóttir resigned in April 2024 to contest the [presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Icelandic_presidential_election), which she lost. She was succeeded as prime minister by [Bjarni Benediktsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarni_Benediktsson_(born_1970)), the leader of the Independence Party, who had previously been the prime minister in 2017 and who was the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs of the current government.\n\nOn 13 October, Benediktsson [announced](https://apnews.com/article/iceland-snap-election-coalition-government-9d170f37de3228506de93444668c416a) that the government had collapsed due to disputes over foreign policy, asylum seekers, and energy, prompting him to call for new elections and ask President Halla Tómasdóttir the next day to dissolve the Althingi and set the elections for 30 November.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the new Prime Minister of Iceland will belong to the Independence Party after the 2024 parliamentary elections, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Current Political Situation\n- The current Prime Minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, who is the leader of the Independence Party, has dissolved the ruling three-party coalition due to internal disagreements. This has led to the announcement of fresh parliamentary elections scheduled for 30 November 2024[2].\n\n## Historical Context and Base Rates\n- Bjarni Benediktsson has been a member of the Icelandic parliament Althingi since 2003 and has led the Independence Party since 2009. He has held significant positions, including Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs and Minister for Foreign Affairs, indicating a strong presence of the Independence Party in Icelandic politics[1][3].\n\n## Coalition Dynamics\n- The dissolved coalition consisted of the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Greens. The decision to dissolve the coalition was driven by policy disagreements, particularly on issues like asylum seekers and energy efficiency[2].\n\n## Upcoming Elections\n- The outcome of the parliamentary elections on 30 November 2024 will determine the composition of the new government. The elections are expected to be influenced by various factors, including the current economic challenges, such as high inflation and rising interest rates, and recent natural disasters like volcanic eruptions[2].\n\nGiven these points, it is not immediately clear whether the new Prime Minister will belong to the Independence Party, as the outcome of the elections will depend on several factors including voter sentiment, campaign performance, and potential coalition formations.\n\n### Key Considerations for Superforecasters:\n- **Base Rates**: The historical performance and popularity of the Independence Party.\n- **Current State**: The impact of recent political and economic events on voter preferences.\n- **Coalition Dynamics**: The potential for new coalition formations and alliances.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The elections are scheduled for 30 November 2024, providing a clear timeline for resolution.\n- **Reference Classes**: Similar political scenarios in Iceland or other countries where coalition governments have been dissolved and new elections were held.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Bjarni Benediktsson still the leader of the Independence Party as of today?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of the current information, Bjarni Benediktsson is still the leader of the Independence Party. This is confirmed in the sources, where it is mentioned that he will remain the leader of the Independence Party and run again in the November elections[2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it customary in Iceland for the leader of the largest party in a coalition to become the prime minister?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not explicitly address the custom or tradition in Iceland regarding whether the leader of the largest party in a coalition automatically becomes the prime minister. They focus on the dissolution of the current coalition and the upcoming elections, but do not provide information on the customary practices for selecting the prime minister.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Independence Party's handling of recent events (e.g., economic issues, natural disasters) been viewed favorably by the public?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not mention the Independence Party or its handling of recent events such as economic issues or natural disasters. The discussions focus on the perceptions and trust in the Democratic and Republican parties regarding various issues, but there is no information about the Independence Party.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Left-Green Movement significantly increased its popularity in recent opinion polls?\nANSWER: No, the Left-Green Movement has not significantly increased its popularity in recent opinion polls. According to the information provided, the Left-Green Movement in Iceland has actually been losing popularity. Since 2022 and the start of the inflation crisis, the party has lost 8.6% of its support[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Independence Party currently leading in national polls ahead of the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary elections?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe Independence Party is not leading in the national polls ahead of the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary elections. According to the latest polling data, the Social Democratic Alliance is currently leading with around 22-25% of the vote, while the Independence Party is polling at around 13-14%[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any other political party overtaken the Independence Party in recent polls leading up to the 2024 elections?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information comparing the polling performance of the Independence Party to other third-party or independent candidates in the context of overtaking them. However, the sources do discuss the performance of various third-party and independent candidates in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nFor example, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an independent candidate, is mentioned as polling in the mid-single digits nationally, but there is no comparison to the Independence Party specifically[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether any other political party has overtaken the Independence Party in recent polls leading up to the 2024 elections is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current President of Iceland likely to offer the mandate to form a government to the leader of the Independence Party after the elections?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether the current President of Iceland will offer the mandate to form a government to the leader of the Independence Party after the elections.\n\nThe sources indicate that the current government coalition has been terminated, and new elections are scheduled for November 2024[2][4]. However, they do not provide information on the specific procedures or decisions the President might make regarding the formation of a new government after these elections.\n\nIn Icelandic politics, the President typically grants the mandate to form a government based on the election results and coalition negotiations. However, without specific details on the outcome of the upcoming elections and the subsequent coalition negotiations, it is impossible to determine with certainty whether the leader of the Independence Party will be offered the mandate to form a government. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Progressive Party likely to form a coalition with the Independence Party after the 2024 elections?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears unlikely that the Progressive Party will form a coalition with the Independence Party after the 2024 elections in Iceland. Here are the key points:\n\n- The current coalition government, which includes the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Left-Green Movement, has collapsed due to inability to find common ground on several issues, including immigration and energy[2][5].\n- There is significant mistrust and disagreement among the coalition partners, which led to the dissolution of the government and the call for snap elections[2][5].\n- The latest polls indicate that the popularity of the current coalition parties, including the Independence Party and the Progressive Party, has been declining since 2022, partly due to their handling of economic and social issues[5].\n\nGiven these points, it seems that the conditions for forming a new coalition between these parties are not favorable. Therefore, the likelihood of the Progressive Party forming a coalition with the Independence Party after the 2024 elections is low.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major scandals or controversies involving the Independence Party that could affect its election performance?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several major scandals and controversies involving different Independence Parties that could affect their election performance:\n\n## Independence Party of Iceland\n- The conservative-led center-right coalition, which included the Independence Party, collapsed due to the \"pardon-gate\" scandal, leading to early elections[1].\n\n## Independence Party of New York\n- The party was involved in a controversy over antisemitic and racist statements by Lenora Fulani and Fred Newman, leading to internal power struggles and attempts to dis-enroll members associated with these individuals[3].\n- The party's assets were frozen due to an investigation into the theft of $1.2 million from Michael Bloomberg's campaign, which ended up in the Independence Party's accounts[3].\n\n## UK Independence Party (UKIP)\n- The party faced allegations of data theft from party databases and internal conflicts, including accusations of racist and far-right elements infiltrating the party[4].\n\n## Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP)\n- While the PIP itself is not highlighted for scandals, the broader political context in Puerto Rico involves corruption scandals at the highest echelons of other parties, which could indirectly affect the PIP's strategy and public perception. However, the PIP is noted for its clean financial record and anti-corruption stances[5].\n\nThese scandals and controversies could potentially impact the public's trust and support for these parties in future elections.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Independence Party historically produced more prime ministers in Iceland than any other party?\nANSWER: To determine if the Independence Party has historically produced more prime ministers in Iceland than any other party, we need to examine the historical data on the prime ministers of Iceland.\n\nFrom the sources provided, particularly the Wikipedia article on the Prime Minister of Iceland, it is clear that the Independence Party has had a significant number of prime ministers. For example, several notable prime ministers have been from the Independence Party, including Ólafur Thors, who served multiple terms, and Bjarni Benediktsson, who is the current prime minister and has served previously as well[3].\n\nHowever, to conclusively state that the Independence Party has produced more prime ministers than any other party, we would need to compare the total number of prime ministers from each party. Here are some key points:\n\n- The Independence Party has had several prime ministers, including Ólafur Thors and Bjarni Benediktsson.\n- Other parties, such as the Social Democratic Party and the Left-Green Movement, have also had prime ministers, but the frequency and duration of their terms need to be compared.\n\nGiven the detailed list of prime ministers in the Wikipedia article, it appears that the Independence Party has indeed had a substantial number of prime ministers. Here is a summary from the article:\n\n- The Independence Party has had multiple prime ministers, including long-serving ones like Ólafur Thors.\n- Other parties, while having prime ministers, do not seem to match the number and duration of terms held by the Independence Party.\n\nTherefore, based on the historical data provided, it can be concluded that the Independence Party has historically produced more prime ministers in Iceland than any other party.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately 50 days. The elections are scheduled for 30 November 2024, and the mandate to form a government must be granted before 1 January 2025 for a \"Yes\" resolution.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n**No.** Current polling data indicates that the Independence Party is trailing behind the Social Democratic Alliance and is unlikely to lead the next government or secure the prime ministership under current circumstances.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nI would forecast a probability of **20%** that the new prime minister will belong to the Independence Party.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nI would forecast a probability of **30%**, allowing more time for potential shifts in public opinion and coalition negotiations favoring the Independence Party.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe Independence Party is currently polling at **13-14%**, while the Social Democratic Alliance leads with **22-25%** of the vote. The Independence Party is not the front-runner, and significant shifts in voter sentiment are unlikely in the short time before the elections.\n\nCoalition dynamics are crucial in Icelandic politics. The previous coalition between the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Left-Green Movement has collapsed due to policy disagreements. It's **unlikely** that the Progressive Party will form a coalition with the Independence Party again soon after the fallout.\n\nWhile the Independence Party has historically produced more prime ministers than any other party, current trends and polling data suggest that they are **less likely** to do so in the upcoming election. Additionally, there are no indications of major scandals affecting their competitors that could dramatically improve their chances.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that the new Prime Minister of Iceland will belong to the Independence Party after the 2024 parliamentary elections is **20%**.\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
