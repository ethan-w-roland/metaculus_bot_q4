    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Donald Trump Lose in New York State by under 6.0 points in the 2024 election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald Trump loses the popular vote in New York State in the 2024 presidential race by less than 6.0 points. If he loses by greater than or equal to 6.0 points, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn the 2022 gubernatorial election, the Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, won by 6.39 points over her Republican opponent. In 2020, Joe Biden won the presidential popular vote in NYS by 23.1 points. On October 27, 2024, Donald Trump held a rally in Madison Square Garden.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Donald Trump will lose in New York State by under 6.0 points in the 2024 presidential election, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context and Voting Patterns\nNew York has consistently voted Democratic in presidential elections since 1988, often by significant margins. In recent elections, the Democratic candidate has won the state by at least 15% since 1992.\n\n## Current Polling Data\nRecent polls indicate that Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump in New York. For example:\n- An average of two polls shows Harris leading Trump by around 13-14 percentage points (54.5% for Harris vs. 41% for Trump).\n- Another set of polls, including those from Siena College, also show Harris leading by margins ranging from 11% to 15%.\n\n## Campaign Dynamics\nWhile Trump has held rallies in New York, including a high-profile event at Madison Square Garden, the state's historical voting patterns and current polling data suggest that these efforts may not significantly alter the outcome. Trump's campaign has acknowledged the personal and symbolic importance of the rally but also faces the reality of New York's strong Democratic leanings.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\nGiven New York's consistent voting history and the current polling margins, it is unlikely that Trump would lose by less than 6.0 points. The state's electoral behavior over the past few decades and the current polling data do not support such a narrow margin.\n\nIn summary, based on historical voting patterns, current polling data, and the state's strong Democratic leanings, it is highly unlikely that Donald Trump will lose in New York State by under 6.0 points in the 2024 election. The answer to the question is likely \"no,\" but this conclusion is based on the available data and historical context rather than speculation.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant increase in Republican voter registration in New York State since the 2020 election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information regarding a significant increase in Republican voter registration in New York State since the 2020 election. The sources focus on other states and general national trends, but do not provide detailed voter registration data for New York State.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major endorsements in New York State shifted in favor of Donald Trump?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that major endorsements in New York State have shifted in favor of Donald Trump for the 2024 presidential election.\n\n- The sources discuss the decisions of major newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post not to endorse any candidate, but they do not mention any significant endorsements in New York State shifting to Donald Trump.\n- The endorsements mentioned are either in favor of Kamala Harris or discuss the absence of endorsements rather than a shift towards Trump.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Democratic candidate campaigned less in New York State compared to previous elections?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether the Democratic candidate has campaigned less in New York State compared to previous elections.\n\n- The sources do indicate that the New York State Democratic Committee is making significant efforts to elect Democrats in the 2024 elections, including opening 30 field offices and increasing fundraising activities, which suggests an active campaign effort.\n- However, there is no direct comparison to the campaign efforts in previous elections that would definitively answer whether the current campaign is less intense.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are third-party candidates expected to receive a significant share of the vote in New York State in the 2024 presidential election?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unlikely that third-party candidates are expected to receive a significant share of the vote in the 2024 presidential election, including in New York State.\n\n- The sources indicate that third-party candidates are generally expected to perform poorly in terms of popular vote share. For example, polls suggest that the two biggest third-party candidates, from the Green Party and the Libertarian Party, are projected to get around one percent of the popular vote, which is significantly lower than their performance in 2016.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout expected to be significantly higher in Republican-leaning areas of New York State?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific indication that voter turnout is expected to be significantly higher in Republican-leaning areas of New York State compared to other areas.\n\n- The sources discuss overall high turnout in early voting across New York State, but they do not differentiate between Republican-leaning and Democratic-leaning areas in terms of turnout expectations.\n- The focus is on the general increase in early voting participation state-wide, without breaking down the data by political leaning of the areas.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major Democratic scandals influencing voters in New York State in 2024?\nANSWER: YES, there are major Democratic scandals that are influencing voters in New York State in 2024.\n\nOne of the most significant scandals involves New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has been indicted on federal corruption charges. These charges include allegations of bribery, wire fraud, conspiracy, and soliciting campaign contributions from foreign entities, particularly from Turkish business leaders.\n\nThis scandal has created significant political fallout, with many Democrats calling for Adams to resign and expressing concerns that the scandal could hurt Democratic candidates in the upcoming elections, including Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign and Democratic bids for control of the House of Representatives.\n\nAdditionally, the scandal is affecting local and national political dynamics, particularly in competitive congressional districts in New York State.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do recent polls in New York State show Donald Trump trailing the Democratic candidate by less than 6 percentage points?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the recent polls specifically for New York State show that Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate, is leading Donald Trump by a significant margin, far exceeding 6 percentage points.\n\nFor example, a poll from Siena College on September 19, 2024, shows Harris leading Trump by 13 percentage points (55% to 42%).\n\nAnother poll from September 23-25, 2024, conducted by The Hill and WPIX, shows Harris leading Trump by 14 percentage points (56% to 42%).\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether recent polls in New York State show Donald Trump trailing the Democratic candidate by less than 6 percentage points is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump's favorability rating significantly improved among New York State voters since 2020?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication that Donald Trump's favorability rating has significantly improved among New York State voters since 2020.\n\nWhile the sources do show that Trump's favorability rating in New York is currently 39% favorable and 57% unfavorable, which is slightly better than Governor Kathy Hochul's ratings, they do not provide a direct comparison to his favorability ratings in 2020.\n\nThe sources mention that Trump made slight gains from 2016 to 2020, capturing 37% of the vote in 2020, but they do not specify how his favorability ratings have changed since then.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant shift towards Republican candidates in recent New York State elections?\nANSWER: Yes, there has been a significant shift towards Republican candidates in recent New York State elections, particularly in certain regions.\n\n- In the 2023 elections, Republicans made notable gains in traditionally Democratic areas, such as Long Island and the Bronx. They secured all four House seats on Long Island and won various local positions in counties like Nassau and Suffolk, indicating a growing influence in suburban areas surrounding New York City.\n\n- The 2022 elections also saw Republicans flip four Democratic seats in New York, which contributed to the GOP's thin majority in the House of Representatives. This was a significant departure from national trends where Democrats generally held their ground.\n\n- These shifts suggest that while New York remains a predominantly Democratic state, there is a noticeable trend of Republican gains in key areas, setting the stage for a more competitive political landscape in the 2024 elections.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are economic conditions in New York State favoring Republican messages in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether economic conditions in New York State are specifically favoring Republican messages in 2024.\n\n- The sources do indicate that economic issues are important to voters, but they do not provide a clear picture of how these issues are swaying voters in New York State towards Republican messages. For example, the Gallup poll highlights the economy as a critical issue nationally, but it does not break down the specifics for New York State.\n- The NY1 article discusses economic concerns in the context of the 2022 New York gubernatorial election, not the 2024 presidential election, and shows that both candidates had different approaches to economic issues, but it does not provide insights into the 2024 presidential election.\n- The Politico and Siena College poll articles mention Trump's campaign activities and polling numbers in New York, but they do not indicate that economic conditions are favoring Republican messages. Instead, they suggest that Kamala Harris is leading in the state and that Trump's visit might be seen as a misstep by some Democratic leaders.\n\nTherefore, the information provided does not clearly indicate whether economic conditions in New York State are favoring Republican messages in 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThe U.S. presidential election is scheduled for **November 5, 2024**, and results for New York State are typically reported on election night or within a day or two. Therefore, the outcome will be known in approximately **1-2 days**.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and the election, Donald Trump would lose New York State by **more than 6.0 percentage points**. Current polling data shows the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, leading by margins ranging from 11% to 15%.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only a few hours left until the election (a quarter of the remaining time), the forecast remains that Donald Trump will lose New York State by more than 6.0 points. The probability of the margin narrowing to under 6.0 points is low.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately four more days until the election, it is unlikely that significant changes would occur to alter the current dynamics. The forecast would still be that Donald Trump will lose New York State by more than 6.0 points.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Voting Patterns:** New York State has consistently voted for Democratic presidential candidates since 1988, often by substantial margins. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden won New York by 23.1 points. While the 2022 gubernatorial election was closer, with the Democratic candidate winning by 6.39 points, presidential elections typically see higher Democratic margins.\n\n- **Current Polling Data:** Recent polls indicate that Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump by margins between 11% and 15% in New York State. For example:\n  - A Siena College poll from September 19, 2024, shows Harris ahead by 13 points (55% to 42%).\n  - The Hill and WPIX poll from late September reports Harris leading by 14 points (56% to 42%).\n  - There are no polls showing Trump trailing by less than 6 percentage points.\n\n- **Campaign Dynamics:** Although Donald Trump has campaigned in New York, including a rally at Madison Square Garden, there is little evidence to suggest a significant shift in voter sentiment. New York's strong Democratic leanings and urban demographics make it challenging for a Republican candidate to close such a substantial gap.\n\n- **Major Democratic Scandals:** The indictment of New York City Mayor Eric Adams on federal corruption charges could impact voter perceptions and turnout. However, while this scandal may slightly affect Democratic enthusiasm, it is unlikely to shift the statewide margin by the 5-9 percentage points needed to bring Trump's loss under 6.0 points.\n\n- **Republican Gains in Recent Elections:** Republicans have made gains in certain areas, flipping congressional seats and winning local offices, particularly in suburban regions like Long Island. Despite these gains, they do not reflect a statewide shift sufficient to overcome the Democratic advantage in a presidential election.\n\n- **Third-Party Candidates and Voter Turnout:** There is no significant third-party presence expected to alter the vote share dramatically. Voter turnout trends do not indicate an unusually high surge in Republican-leaning areas that would drastically change the expected outcome.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** Combining historical trends, current polling, campaign activities, and recent political developments, the probability that Donald Trump will lose New York State by under 6.0 points remains low. While unforeseen events can occur, the data suggests that a substantial change in the election outcome is unlikely within the remaining time frame.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
