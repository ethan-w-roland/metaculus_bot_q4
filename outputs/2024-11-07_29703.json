    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill West Virginia have 1.4 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-07\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/west-virginia) lists greater than or equal to 1.4 million West Virginia residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after December 31, 2024. If the number is below 1.4 million, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[West Virginia facing worst drought in at least two decades](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/west-virginia-facing-worst-drought-least-two-decades)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether West Virginia will have 1.4 million or more residents living in drought conditions by December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Drought Conditions\n- West Virginia, particularly areas like Wetzel County, is experiencing extreme drought conditions. The National Weather Service has categorized Wetzel County as being in an extreme drought category, which is expected to continue for several months.\n\n## Impact and Extent\n- The drought has severely affected water supplies, with areas like Pine Grove running out of water and schools transitioning to remote status due to the lack of water.\n- The state as a whole has seen significant drought expansion, with severe and extreme drought conditions affecting various regions.\n\n## Rainfall Deficits\n- The area is significantly behind in normal rainfall, with Wetzel County needing as much as a foot of rain to recover from the current drought conditions. The average rainfall for the area is 3 inches per month, but current forecasts do not anticipate sufficient rainfall to alleviate the drought in the near future.\n\n## Historical Context\n- Droughts in West Virginia are not uncommon, with significant droughts occurring in various years since 2000. However, the current drought is part of a broader pattern affecting the region in 2023-2024.\n\n## Population Affected\n- While the exact number of residents currently living in drought-affected areas is not specified, the widespread nature of the drought suggests a significant portion of the state's population is impacted. West Virginia's total population is approximately 1.7 million people, so if a substantial part of the state remains in drought, it is plausible that over 1.4 million residents could be affected.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to infer that a large portion of West Virginia's population could still be living in drought conditions by December 31, 2024, especially if the current forecasts and drought trends continue. However, without precise data on the population affected by the drought, it is not possible to definitively answer the question as a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the U.S. Drought Monitor ever recorded over 1.4 million West Virginia residents living in drought conditions on December 31 in previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or mention of the exact number of West Virginia residents living in drought conditions on December 31 of previous years. The sources discuss current and recent drought conditions, but they do not provide historical data for specific dates like December 31.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has West Virginia's population remained above 1.4 million according to recent estimates?\nANSWER: No, West Virginia's population has not remained above 1.4 million according to recent estimates. As of the 2020 census, the population of West Virginia was 1,793,716, and it has continued to decline since then. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that West Virginia lost an additional 27,609 people since the 2020 census, bringing the population below 1.8 million.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has West Virginia experienced drought conditions affecting over 1.4 million residents at any point in the past three years?\nANSWER: Yes, West Virginia has experienced drought conditions affecting a significant portion of its population in the past year. Here are the key points:\n\n- By mid-August 2024, 99% of West Virginia was in drought, which implies that nearly the entire state, and thus its population, was affected by drought conditions.\n- Given that West Virginia's population is approximately 1.79 million people, 99% of the state being in drought would indeed affect over 1.4 million residents.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current drought in West Virginia projected to worsen over the next year?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no clear projection that the current drought in West Virginia will worsen over the next year. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The sources provide detailed information about the current drought conditions in West Virginia, including the severity and impact of the drought.\n- However, none of the sources provide a specific projection for the next year regarding whether the drought will worsen.\n- The only mention of future predictions is from NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, which states that there is no prediction of drought development, but this does not address whether the current drought will worsen.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is more than 80% of West Virginia currently experiencing drought conditions according to the U.S. Drought Monitor?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the most recent and specific information about West Virginia's drought conditions can be found in the article from September 2024. However, this article does not provide the current status as of November 2024.\n\nAs of the last update in September 2024, it was reported that \"by mid-August, 99% of the state was in drought\".\n\nSince the sources do not provide an update for November 2024 specifically, we cannot determine the current drought conditions accurately. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are water restrictions currently in place for a majority of West Virginia's counties due to drought conditions?\nANSWER: Yes, water restrictions are currently in place for a majority of West Virginia's counties due to drought conditions. Here are the key points:\n\n- Governor Justice extended a State of Emergency for all 55 counties in West Virginia due to ongoing drought conditions, indicating widespread impact.\n- The U.S. Drought Monitor shows extreme, severe, and moderate drought conditions affecting the entire state, which would likely necessitate water restrictions.\n- The Western Virginia Water Authority has implemented drought contingency plans, including mandatory conservation and emergency restrictions, in response to drought conditions.\n\nThese sources collectively indicate that water restrictions are indeed in place to address the drought conditions affecting a majority of West Virginia's counties.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do current long-term weather forecasts predict continued drought conditions in West Virginia through December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the forecasts suggest that drought conditions are likely to persist in the region that includes West Virginia through the end of 2024.\n\n- The U.S. climate outlook for November 2024 indicates that drought persistence and development are forecast for parts of the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, which includes West Virginia.\n- The special drought webinar and other climate outlooks mention that drought conditions have worsened in the region and are expected to continue, especially given the dry conditions observed in October and the anticipated below-normal precipitation in the East Coast region through November and potentially beyond.\n\nTherefore, the current long-term weather forecasts do predict continued drought conditions in West Virginia through December 31, 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the area of West Virginia experiencing severe or extreme drought increased over the past six months?\nANSWER: Yes, the area of West Virginia experiencing severe or extreme drought has increased over the past six months.\n\n- By mid-August, 99% of the state was in drought, with extreme drought present in the state for the first time in over a decade.\n- As of September 12, 53.2% of West Virginia was in an extreme drought, which is the second highest classification on the scale.\n- West Virginia set a new maximum drought intensity record on September 24 when exceptional drought affected 16.6% of the state.\n- Despite some recent rainfall, drought conditions have persisted, although the area in exceptional drought has decreased slightly from the summer months.\n\nThese sources indicate a significant expansion and intensification of drought conditions in West Virginia over the past six months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any planned weather modification efforts or significant infrastructure projects expected to relieve drought conditions in West Virginia before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any planned weather modification efforts or significant infrastructure projects specifically aimed at relieving drought conditions in West Virginia before December 31, 2024.\n\n- The sources from NOAA discuss the reporting and regulation of weather modification activities, but they do not indicate any ongoing or planned weather modification efforts in West Virginia.\n- The FEMA sources focus on disaster recovery and assistance following severe storms, floods, and tornadoes in West Virginia, but they do not mention any projects related to drought relief or weather modification.\n- The Nature Conservancy source discusses natural climate solutions and forest management in West Virginia, but it does not address weather modification or infrastructure projects for drought relief.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are climate models predicting below-average precipitation for West Virginia for the remainder of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the relevant points for West Virginia's precipitation outlook for the remainder of 2024:\n\n- For September, there is a prediction of above-normal precipitation favored for the southern half of West Virginia, as indicated in the Northeast climate outlook.\n- For October, the precipitation outlook favors below-average rainfall across large parts of the country, but there is no specific mention of West Virginia being in the below-average category. Instead, the focus is on other regions such as the southern and central Plains.\n- The fall precipitation outlook (October to December) suggests equal chances of below, near, or above normal precipitation for many regions, but it does not specify West Virginia explicitly. However, it does mention that the Southeast, which includes parts of West Virginia, has equal chances due to potential tropical activity and other factors.\n\nGiven this information, it is not clear that climate models are predicting below-average precipitation specifically for West Virginia for the remainder of 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 54 days remain until December 31, 2024.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If current drought conditions persist, the outcome would likely be **Yes**, as over 1.4 million residents would be living in drought.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With less time for conditions to change, I would assign a higher probability, perhaps around **95%**, that the outcome is **Yes**.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** With more time for potential changes in weather patterns, I would assign a lower probability, perhaps around **75%**, that the outcome is **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nCurrently, West Virginia is experiencing significant drought conditions. As of mid-August 2024, reports indicate that 99% of the state was in drought, with severe and extreme drought affecting various regions. Given West Virginia's population of approximately 1.79 million people, this means that well over 1.4 million residents are currently living in areas experiencing drought.\n\nClimate forecasts and long-term weather outlooks suggest that drought conditions in West Virginia are likely to persist through the end of 2024. The U.S. Climate Outlook for November 2024 indicates that drought persistence is expected in parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, which include West Virginia. Additionally, there are no indications of significant rainfall that would alleviate the drought conditions before the resolution date.\n\nThere are no reports of planned weather modification efforts or major infrastructure projects that could mitigate the drought conditions in the near term. With approximately 54 days remaining until December 31, 2024, it is unlikely that substantial changes in weather patterns will occur to dramatically reduce the number of residents living in drought.\n\nGiven the current extent of the drought, the lack of forecasted relief, and the short time frame until the resolution date, it is highly probable that West Virginia will have 1.4 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024.\n\n**Probability: 90%**",
