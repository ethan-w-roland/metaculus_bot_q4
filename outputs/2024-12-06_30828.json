    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Joe Biden sign 4 or more executive orders after Election Day and before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves **Yes** if the number of executive orders signed by President Joe Biden after November 5, 2024, and before January 1, 2025, is 4 or more according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) such as the [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders) and the White House's [Presidential Actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/) portal.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nOnly official [executive orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order) count. Other actions such as memoranda, notices and proclamations do not.\r\n\r\nExecutive orders are counted according to the date they are signed; date published is immaterial.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order): \r\n\r\n>In the United States, an executive order is a directive by the president of the United States that manages operations of the federal government.The legal or constitutional basis for executive orders has multiple sources. Article Two of the United States Constitution gives presidents broad executive and enforcement authority to use their discretion to determine how to enforce the law or to otherwise manage the resources and staff of the executive branch. The ability to make such orders is also based on expressed or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the president some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation)\r\n\r\nIn his final months in office, Joe Biden has signed executive orders on [gun violence](https://baystatebanner.com/2024/10/02/biden-signs-executive-orders-on-gun-violence/) and [labor standards](https://natlawreview.com/article/president-biden-signs-executive-order-directing-agencies-prioritize-pro-union-and).\r\n\r\nSince becoming President, Biden has issued executive orders at the follow count per month:\r\n\r\n| Month            | 2021 | Month            | 2023 |\r\n|-------------------|------|------------------|------|\r\n| January 2021     | 25   | January 2023     | 0    |\r\n| February 2021    | 9    | February 2023    | 1    |\r\n| March 2021       | 3    | March 2023       | 2    |\r\n| April 2021       | 5    | April 2023       | 4    |\r\n| May 2021         | 5    | May 2023         | 2    |\r\n| June 2021        | 5    | June 2023        | 2    |\r\n| July 2021        | 1    | July 2023        | 3    |\r\n| August 2021      | 3    | August 2023      | 2    |\r\n| September 2021   | 9    | September 2023   | 3    |\r\n| October 2021     | 3    | October 2023     | 1    |\r\n| November 2021    | 4    | November 2023    | 1    |\r\n| December 2021    | 6    | December 2023    | 3    |\r\n\r\n| Month            | 2022 | Month            | 2024 |\r\n|-------------------|------|------------------|------|\r\n| January 2022     | 1    | January 2024     | 0    |\r\n| February 2022    | 3    | February 2024    | 3    |\r\n| March 2022       | 4    | March 2024       | 4    |\r\n| April 2022       | 3    | April 2024       | 1    |\r\n| May 2022         | 2    | May 2024         | 0    |\r\n| June 2022        | 1    | June 2024        | 1    |\r\n| July 2022        | 3    | July 2024        | 2    |\r\n| August 2022      | 2    | August 2024      | 0    |\r\n| September 2022   | 4    | September 2024   | 1    |\r\n| October 2022     | 4    | October 2024     | 0    |\r\n| November 2022    | 0    | November 2024    | 1    |\r\n| December 2022    | 2    | December 2024    | ?    |\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Joe Biden signing 4 or more executive orders after Election Day and before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Historical Context and Recent Actions\n- President Biden has been active in using executive orders to advance his administration's agenda. For example, he signed 24 executive orders in his first eight days in office in 2021, which is a higher pace than most of his predecessors[3][4].\n- Recently, Biden announced a new Executive Order focusing on combating emerging firearms threats and improving school-based active shooter drills, indicating ongoing use of executive orders to address pressing issues[1].\n\n## Current Political Climate\n- With the upcoming transition of power to President-elect Donald Trump in January 2025, Biden's window for signing new executive orders is limited. However, this does not necessarily mean he will slow down, as presidents often use the remainder of their term to solidify their legacy and implement last-minute policies[3][5].\n\n## Forecasting Considerations\n- The question on Metaculus about the number of executive orders Biden will sign after Election Day and before January 1, 2025, suggests that forecasters are considering various scenarios. However, there is no clear historical precedent or recent indication that would definitively answer whether he will sign 4 or more executive orders in this period[2].\n\n## Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- Given the short timeframe (from Election Day to January 1, 2025), the number of executive orders signed would depend on the urgency and priority of the issues Biden's administration aims to address. Historically, presidents have used executive orders more frequently in the final months of their term to ensure their policies are implemented before the transition[4].\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is possible for Biden to sign 4 or more executive orders in the remaining time, there is no clear evidence to definitively answer this question as yes or no. The decision would depend on various factors, including the administration's priorities, the urgency of the issues, and the political climate. Therefore, this question cannot be clearly answered with a yes or no based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden signed any executive orders in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that Joe Biden has signed any executive orders in December 2024. The sources discuss various executive actions and orders signed by Biden, but they do not provide a timeline that includes December 2024 specifically.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden signed an executive order related to gun violence since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that President Joe Biden signed executive orders related to gun violence in late September 2024, specifically on September 26, 2024[2][3][5], which is before November 5, 2024. There is no mention of any executive orders signed after November 5, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden signed at least one executive order since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order on November 21, 2024, which is after November 5, 2024. This executive order was for establishing a second emergency board to investigate a dispute between New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and its locomotive engineers[3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there four or more executive orders pending for Joe Biden to sign before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about the number of executive orders that are pending for Joe Biden to sign before January 1, 2025. The sources list various executive orders that have already been issued by President Biden, but they do not mention any pending orders.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden signed an executive order related to labor standards since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed the “Good Jobs Executive Order” on September 6, 2024, which is well before November 5, 2024. This executive order directs federal agencies to prioritize and incentivize companies that adhere to a list of labor standards[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the White House announced plans to increase the signing of executive orders in the final months of Joe Biden’s term?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not mention any specific plans or announcements from the White House regarding an increase in the signing of executive orders in the final months of Joe Biden’s term. They discuss various executive actions and their impacts, but do not address future plans for the frequency or number of executive orders[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden signed three or more executive orders since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Joe Biden signed one executive order in November 2024, which was on November 21, 2024, to establish a second emergency board to investigate a dispute between New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and its locomotive engineers[3].\n\nThere is no indication in the sources that he signed any additional executive orders after November 5, 2024, beyond the one mentioned on November 21, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden signed two or more executive orders since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nSince November 5, 2024, President Joe Biden has signed at least one executive order, and there is evidence to suggest he signed more than one in the relevant timeframe.\n\n- On November 21, 2024, Biden issued an executive order establishing a second emergency board to investigate a dispute between New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and its locomotive engineers[3].\n- Additionally, Biden signed two executive orders since dropping out of the 2024 race, one of which was after November 5, 2024. One of these orders was signed in November, and the other was signed earlier but still within the context of his recent activities[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major policy initiatives announced by Joe Biden in late 2024 that would require executive orders?\nANSWER: Yes, there are major policy initiatives announced by Joe Biden in late 2024 that involve or require executive orders.\n\nOne example is the Executive Order announced on September 26, 2024, which directs federal agencies to combat emerging firearms threats and improve school-based active shooter drills. This order includes several actions such as establishing an Emerging Firearms Threats Task Force and directing various federal departments to develop and publish information on school-based active shooter drills[2].\n\nAnother example is the \"Good Jobs\" executive order signed in late summer 2024, which ensures that large federal construction projects are built with project labor agreements[5].\n\nThese initiatives demonstrate that Biden has indeed issued executive orders for significant policy changes in late 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do historical precedents show that outgoing presidents typically sign four or more executive orders in their final months in office?\nANSWER: Historical precedents indicate that outgoing presidents often increase their use of executive orders in their final months in office, particularly when the incoming president is from a different political party.\n\n- President Obama issued 17 executive orders during the 73 days of his outgoing transition period, which is a significant increase from his average[1].\n- President George W. Bush issued 11 executive orders during the 77 days of his outgoing transition period, also an increase from his average[1].\n- The practice of issuing executive orders in the final months is noted as a way for outgoing presidents to establish or change policy and secure their legacy, especially when the incoming president is expected to have different policy preferences[3][4].\n\nGiven these examples, it is clear that outgoing presidents have historically signed more than four executive orders in their final months in office, especially in transition periods involving a change in party.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately **25 days** remain from December 6, 2024, until January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf trends continue as they are, Joe Biden has signed **1 executive order** since November 5, 2024. Without any changes, it's likely he would sign **fewer than 4 executive orders**, resulting in a **\"No\"** outcome.\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about **6 days** remaining, the window for signing executive orders is extremely limited. In such a short timeframe, it's improbable for Biden to sign **4 or more executive orders**, suggesting a **low probability** of the outcome being \"Yes.\"\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith **100 days** instead of 25, there would be ample opportunity for Biden to issue executive orders. Historically, outgoing presidents have signed numerous executive orders in their final months. In this extended period, the probability of signing **4 or more executive orders** would be **high**.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAnalyzing the historical behavior of outgoing presidents provides valuable insight. Presidents often increase their use of executive orders in their final months to solidify their legacy and implement key policies before a transition of power. For instance:\n\n- **President Obama** issued **17 executive orders** in his last 73 days.\n- **President George W. Bush** signed **11 executive orders** in his final 77 days.\n\nGiven that Biden has already signed **1 executive order** since November 5, 2024, and considering the historical rate of executive orders in the concluding period of a presidency, signing **4 or more executive orders** within the remaining **25 days** is plausible. However, the shorter timeframe compared to previous presidents' final months slightly moderates the probability.\n\nTaking into account Biden's current activity, the urgency often associated with finalizing executive actions, and historical precedents, the likelihood of signing **4 or more executive orders** by January 1, 2025, is significant but not certain.\n\n**Probability:** **65%**",
