    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill November 2024 have a global temperature increase of >1.31 degrees?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Global Land and Ocean Average Temperature Anomaly for November 2024 is greater than 1.31 degrees according to NOAA at [this page](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series). Region is \"Global\" and surface is \"Land and Ocean.\"\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/global-temperature-anomalies), \"The term temperature anomaly means a departure from a reference value or long-term average. A positive anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was warmer than the reference value, while a negative anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was cooler than the reference value.\" \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether November 2024 will have a global temperature increase of more than 1.31°C above pre-industrial levels, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends and Projections\n- The year 2024 is on track to be the warmest year on record, with the January-September global mean surface air temperature already at 1.54°C (±0.13°C) above the pre-industrial average[1][4][5].\n- The first ten months of 2024 have seen an average global temperature anomaly of 0.71°C above the 1991-2020 average, and an estimated 1.62°C above the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average[5].\n\n## Monthly and Annual Averages\n- October 2024 was the second-warmest October on record globally, with a temperature anomaly of 1.32°C above the 1901-2000 average[3].\n- The year-to-date (January-October) global surface temperature has been the warmest in the 175-year record, with an anomaly of 1.28°C above the 1901-2000 average[3].\n\n## Natural Variability and Climate Events\n- A strong El Niño event earlier in the year contributed to the exceptionally high global temperatures, although temperatures have remained high even after the El Niño event faded[2][4].\n- ENSO-neutral conditions are expected to continue for the next several months, with a potential transition to La Niña conditions later in the year[3].\n\n## Predictions and Certainties\n- It is virtually certain that 2024 will be the warmest year on record, and there is a high likelihood that the annual temperature will exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels according to several datasets[2][5].\n\nGiven these points, while the exact temperature anomaly for November 2024 is not yet known, the overall trend and projections suggest that it is highly likely to continue the pattern of significant warming. However, whether the specific threshold of >1.31°C will be exceeded in November alone cannot be definitively determined from the available data, as monthly variations can occur due to natural climate variability.\n\nTherefore, while the year as a whole is expected to exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, the precise November temperature anomaly remains to be confirmed. The answer to whether November 2024 will have a global temperature increase of >1.31 degrees is not immediately clear based on the current information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has NOAA provided the Global Land and Ocean Average Temperature Anomaly data for November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information available for the global land and ocean average temperature anomaly data specifically for November 2024. The sources provide data up to October 2024, but do not include November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has NOAA reported that the year-to-date (January-October) global surface temperature for 2024 is above 1.28 degrees above the 1901-2000 average?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nNOAA has reported that the year-to-date (January–October) global surface temperature for 2024 was 1.28°C (2.30°F) above the 1901-2000 average, making it the warmest such period on record[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the global land and ocean average temperature anomaly for October 2024 greater than 1.31 degrees according to NOAA?\nANSWER: According to the NOAA reports, the global surface temperature anomaly for October 2024 was 1.32°C (2.38°F) above the 20th-century average[2][4].\n\nTherefore, the global land and ocean average temperature anomaly for October 2024 is indeed greater than 1.31°C.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did NOAA report that October 2024 was the second-warmest October on record globally?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nNOAA reported that October 2024 was the second-warmest October on record globally, as stated in multiple sources[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the global mean surface air temperature for January-September 2024 above 1.54 degrees compared to the pre-industrial average?\nANSWER: YES, the global mean surface air temperature for January-September 2024 is above 1.54 degrees compared to the pre-industrial average. This is confirmed by multiple sources, including the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and Copernicus Climate Change Service reports, which state that the January-September 2024 global mean surface air temperature was 1.54°C above the pre-industrial level[4][5][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Was there a strong El Niño event in 2024 that contributed to global temperatures?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nA strong El Niño event did occur and contributed significantly to global temperatures in 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The El Niño event began in mid-2023, strengthened into December 2023, and faded by mid-May 2024[1][3][5].\n- This El Niño event was associated with record-high global temperatures, with 2023 being one of the warmest years on record and 2024 continuing to see exceptionally high temperatures despite the El Niño fading[1][3][4].\n- The event contributed to global warming spikes, with 2024 seeing record or near-record temperatures for several months of the year[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did NOAA confirm that 2024 will be the warmest year on record?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, NOAA has not definitively confirmed that 2024 will be the warmest year on record, although they have indicated a high likelihood of this outcome.\n\n- The NOAA report for June 2024 mentions that there is a \"59% chance that 2024 will rank as the warmest year on record\" and notes it will \"rank in the top five\" with certainty[1].\n- By October 2024, NOAA's statistical analysis suggests it is \"practically certain that 2024 will rank as the warmest year on record\"[3].\n\nWhile the language in the October report is strong, it does not use the phrase \"confirmed\" but rather \"practically certain,\" which implies a very high probability but not absolute certainty.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has NOAA projected that the annual temperature for 2024 will exceed 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, NOAA has indicated that the year 2024 is likely to be the warmest on record, but the specific comparison to pre-industrial levels is not directly addressed in these sources.\n\nHowever, the sources do mention that the global surface temperature for January–October 2024 was 1.28°C (2.30°F) above the 1901-2000 average[1].\n\nSince pre-industrial levels are generally considered to be around the late 19th century, and the 1901-2000 average is slightly warmer than pre-industrial levels, a temperature anomaly of 1.28°C above this average suggests that the temperature could be close to or exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. However, this is not explicitly stated in the sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are ENSO-neutral conditions present in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, as of the latest updates, ENSO-neutral conditions are still present and likely to continue through November 2024.\n\n- The WMO update from September 2024 indicates that ENSO-neutral conditions were observed over the past three months and are expected to continue, with a 45% chance of persistence through September-November and 40% thereafter[1][3].\n- The Climate Prediction Center's (CPC) ENSO Diagnostic Discussion also notes that ENSO-neutral conditions are present, and while La Niña is favored to emerge during September-November, the current conditions as of late August and early November still reflect ENSO-neutral status[4][5].\n- Additionally, the November 2024 outlook suggests that the window for La Niña development is eroding, and neutral ENSO may extend through the upcoming northern hemisphere winter[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a high likelihood that the November 2024 temperature anomaly will follow the existing warming trend?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is not a high likelihood that the November 2024 temperature anomaly will follow a general warming trend globally, especially in regions influenced by the anticipated La Niña event.\n\n- For the global perspective, the predictions indicate that the emergence of a weak La Niña event is expected, which typically leads to cooler-than-average temperatures in certain regions. For example, in coastal areas of southern South America and extending north along the west coast into the eastern Pacific, below- or near-normal temperatures are expected[1][5].\n\n- In the United States, while the temperature outlook for November favors well above average temperatures across the central and eastern parts of the nation, this is more specific to those regions and does not indicate a global warming trend. The influence of La Niña is also noted, particularly in southern Alaska, where cooler-than-average temperatures are favored[4].\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of a global warming trend in temperature anomalies for November 2024 is not high, given the regional variations and the expected impacts of La Niña.\n\n**NO**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nApproximately 3 days until NOAA releases the November 2024 global temperature anomaly data, assuming no delays.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends continue without any significant changes, it is likely that the November 2024 global temperature anomaly would exceed 1.31°C, considering that October 2024 already surpassed this threshold and the year 2024 is on track to be the warmest on record.\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only a quarter of the time left until data release, uncertainty increases due to potential fluctuations. In this scenario, I would forecast a 70% probability that November 2024 surpasses the 1.31°C anomaly.\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nIf there were four times the time left until data release, allowing for more climate variability and potential moderating factors, I would forecast a 85% probability that the November 2024 anomaly exceeds 1.31°C.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nConsidering the data up to October 2024 shows a consistent warming trend with October's anomaly at 1.32°C, it suggests that November is also likely to maintain or exceed this level. While the potential onset of La Niña conditions may exert a cooling influence, the overall global trend for 2024 remains strongly positive. The probability accounts for the high baseline trend, the possibility of moderate cooling, and the minimal time left for significant deviations before the outcome is determined.\n\n**Probability:** 80%",
