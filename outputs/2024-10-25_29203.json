{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill China officially announce export restrictions on any additional metals before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as \"Yes\" if, before January 1, 2025, the Chinese government or any of its official agencies (e.g., Ministry of Commerce, General Administration of Customs) publicly announces (according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions)) new export restrictions or controls on any metals not previously subject to such measures as of September 29, 2024.\n\nThe question will resolve as \"No\" if no such announcement is made by the Chinese government or its agencies before January 1, 2025, according to any credible source reporting that can be found.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- The announcement must be an official statement from the Chinese government or its agencies and must clearly indicate the imposition of new export restrictions or controls on specific metals.\n- If China announces the intention to impose new export restrictions or controls on a metal but does not provide a specific implementation date, the question will resolve as \"Yes\" if the announcement is made before January 1, 2025.\n- Amendments or extensions of existing export restrictions on metals will not count towards a \"Yes\" resolution unless they substantially expand the scope or severity of the controls. In case of any ambiguity in such cases, a panel of Metaculus Admins will make a ruling.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nChina's [recent announcement](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/chinas-antimony-export-controls-rattle-the-tungsten-industry.html) of export controls on antimony, effective September 15, 2024, has raised concerns among industry insiders about the country's willingness to leverage its dominance in the global supply chain of critical metals. Antimony, used in bullets, nuclear weapons production, and lead-acid batteries, is just one of many metals that China has a significant share of global production.\n\nThe announcement follows China's previous export controls [on graphite](https://www.csis.org/analysis/chinas-use-graphite-export-restrictions-encourages-diversification) in 2023 and restrictions on germanium and gallium, two metals used in chipmaking, in response to U.S. efforts to limit China's access to high-end semiconductors. These moves have led some industry experts to speculate that China may soon impose export controls on other critical metals, such as tungsten, which is nearly as hard as a diamond and used in weapons, semiconductors, and industrial cutting machines.\n\nChina's actions are seen by some as retaliatory measures against what it perceives as intrusions into its national interests. As a result, companies in the U.S. and elsewhere are exploring alternatives to reduce their reliance on China for critical metals. However, it remains to be seen whether China will follow through with a blanket implementation of the latest export controls or announce restrictions on additional metals in the near future.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of China announcing export restrictions on additional metals before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Recent Actions and Trends\n- China has recently imposed export restrictions on several critical minerals, including antimony, gallium, germanium, and rare earth materials, citing national security concerns.\n- These restrictions are part of a broader strategy to control the export of critical minerals and technologies, as seen in the revised Catalogue for Prohibited and Restricted Export Technologies.\n\n## Current Export Control Environment\n- The Chinese government has been actively refining its export control measures, with recent amendments to the Catalogue for Prohibited and Restricted Export Technologies. This includes adding new items for restricted export and adjusting control points for various technologies.\n\n## Global Context and Trade Tensions\n- The ongoing trade tensions between China and the US, including the imposition of tariffs by the US on Chinese imports, have led China to strengthen its export control measures as a strategic response.\n\n## Timing and Precedents\n- The recent announcement of export restrictions on antimony, effective from September 15, 2024, indicates that China is willing to act swiftly in response to perceived national security and economic interests.\n\nGiven these points, while there is no definitive information available on specific upcoming announcements, the trend suggests that China is actively and continuously reviewing and adjusting its export control policies. Therefore, it is plausible that additional metals could be subject to export restrictions before January 1, 2025, especially in the context of ongoing strategic competition and trade tensions.\n\nHowever, without explicit announcements or leaks from Chinese authorities, it is not possible to confirm this with certainty. The decision to impose new restrictions would depend on various factors, including national security considerations, economic strategies, and diplomatic relations.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming Chinese policy meetings or events where export restrictions on metals could be announced?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of upcoming Chinese policy meetings or events where new export restrictions on metals are to be announced. The sources discuss recent and existing export controls on various minerals such as gallium, germanium, graphite, and antimony, but they do not provide information about future meetings or events where additional restrictions might be announced.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China recently amended its export control laws or regulations to include additional metals?\nANSWER: Yes, China has recently amended its export control laws or regulations to include additional metals and materials.\n\n- On August 15, 2024, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced export control measures on antimony and related items, which include metal antimony, antimony hydride, and antimony ore, effective from September 15, 2024.\n\nThis indicates that China has indeed included additional metals, specifically antimony and related items, under its export control regulations.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China announced export restrictions on metals within the past year?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nChina has announced export restrictions on several metals within the past year. Here are some examples:\n\n- China has imposed export controls on antimony, effective from September 15, 2024, citing national security and non-proliferation reasons.\n- Last year, China restricted the export of gallium and germanium, which are used in computer chips and solar cells, also for national security reasons.\n- Additionally, China has implemented export controls on graphite to support its dominant EV battery manufacturers.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Chinese state media outlets recently discussed the possibility of new export controls on metals?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically mention discussions by Chinese state media outlets regarding the possibility of new export controls on metals. However, they do detail recent announcements and implementations of export controls by China's Ministry of Commerce on various critical minerals such as gallium, germanium, graphite, and antimony, as well as speculation about potential future controls on other minerals like tungsten, bismuth, rubidium, and tantalum.\n\nGiven that the question specifically asks about discussions by Chinese state media outlets, and the sources provided do not address this aspect, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the United States or other countries recently imposed new trade restrictions or sanctions on China that could provoke retaliatory measures?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThe United States has recently imposed new trade restrictions on China. On September 13, 2024, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced final modifications to the Section 301 tariff actions, including significant increases in tariff rates on various Chinese imports. These increases affect products such as electric vehicles, electric vehicle batteries, medical goods, semiconductors, steel and aluminum products, and other critical materials, with some tariffs ranging from 25% to 100% and phased implementations through 2025 and 2026.\n\nAdditionally, the U.S. Treasury has added Chinese entities to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, subjecting them to sanctions and restricting their access to the U.S. financial system. These actions could potentially provoke retaliatory measures from China.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any official announcement or leak indicating that China is considering export restrictions on tungsten or any other metal?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been indications and discussions suggesting that China might consider or is likely to impose export restrictions on other metals, including tungsten.\n\n- China has recently announced export controls on antimony, which has sent tremors through the global supply chain for other critical minerals, including tungsten. Experts predict that China could impose export controls on tungsten by the end of the year or sooner, given its dominant position in the global tungsten market and the strategic importance of the metal.\n\n- The context of ongoing trade tensions and China's previous actions on other critical minerals, such as graphite, gallium, and germanium, further supports the likelihood of future restrictions on other metals like tungsten.\n\nTherefore, while there is no official announcement specifically on tungsten at the moment, there are strong indications and predictions from experts that such restrictions could be imminent.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does China currently dominate the global production of any critical metals that are not currently under export restrictions?\nANSWER: Yes, China currently dominates the global production and processing of several critical metals that are not necessarily under export restrictions at the moment.\n\n- China accounts for around two-thirds of the world's processing and refining capacity for critical minerals, including more than half of the world's refining of aluminum, lithium, and cobalt, and nearly 90% of the refining of rare earth metals and manganese.\n- Specifically, China has a significant dominance in the processing of rare earth elements, controlling over 85% of the processing capacity for both heavy and light rare earths.\n- Additionally, China is the global lead producer of 29 commodities, including 22 metals and seven industrial minerals, and it refines and exports large volumes of these critical minerals.\n\nWhile there have been instances of China imposing export restrictions on certain critical minerals in the past, the current dominance in production and processing is not contingent on these restrictions being in place at the moment.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any indications from Chinese government sources suggesting they might impose new export restrictions on additional metals?\nANSWER: Yes, there are indications from Chinese government sources and analyses suggesting that China might impose new export restrictions on additional metals beyond antimony.\n\n- The announcement of export controls on antimony is part of a broader trend of China restricting critical mineral exports. Previous restrictions were imposed on graphite, germanium, gallium, and rare earth processing technologies, which suggests a pattern of expanding control over critical minerals.\n\n- Analysts and industry experts speculate that China could extend these restrictions to other minerals such as bismuth, rubidium, and tantalum, given the U.S. reliance on Chinese imports of these materials.\n\n- The context provided by the recent export control measures on aerospace and special organic materials, effective from July 1, 2024, indicates China's ongoing efforts to manage its minerals value chain and protect national security interests, which could be extended to other critical minerals.\n\nThese points suggest that China is likely to consider imposing export restrictions on additional metals in the future.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there ongoing trade tensions between China and other countries that might prompt China to impose new export restrictions on metals?\nANSWER: YES, there are ongoing trade tensions between China and other countries, particularly the United States, that have prompted China to impose new export restrictions on metals.\n\n- China's recent export controls on antimony, as well as other critical minerals like gallium, germanium, and graphite, are seen as a response to US export curbs on advanced semiconductor chips and other technologies.\n- These restrictions are part of a broader strategy by China to protect its national security and interests, and to counter US sanctions and tech restrictions.\n- The escalating tensions and geopolitical strains, including those related to the semiconductor sector and military applications, have led to these export controls.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a trend of increasing Chinese export restrictions on critical materials over the past few years?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a trend of increasing Chinese export restrictions on critical materials over the past few years.\n\n- China has recently announced export restrictions on antimony, which will commence on September 15, 2024, to safeguard national security and interests.\n- In 2023, China imposed export controls on other critical metals such as graphite, germanium, gallium, and rare earth processing technologies.\n- Last year, China also enacted export restrictions on gallium and germanium, citing the need to protect national security.\n- Additionally, China has restricted the export of technology related to rare earth magnets and the extraction and separation of critical materials.\n- There are also anticipations and concerns about potential future restrictions on other critical materials like tungsten.\n\nThese actions indicate a pattern of increasing export controls by China on various critical minerals and technologies.", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately 67 days remaining until January 1, 2025. This equates to about two months and one week.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changes between now and January 1, 2025\u2014that is, if China does not announce any new export restrictions on additional metals\u2014the outcome of the question would be **\"No.\"**\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only a quarter of the time left (approximately 17 days remaining), I would forecast a lower probability of a \"Yes\" outcome, estimating it at around **15%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were four times the remaining time (approximately 268 days, extending the deadline to around July 2025), I would forecast a higher probability of a \"Yes\" outcome, estimating it at around **60%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nChina has demonstrated a pattern of imposing export restrictions on critical metals over the past few years. Notable recent actions include:\n\n- **August 15, 2024:** Announcement of export controls on antimony, effective September 15, 2024.\n- **Earlier in 2024 and 2023:** Export restrictions on gallium, germanium, and graphite.\n  \nThese measures are often seen as strategic responses to geopolitical tensions, particularly with the United States. The U.S. has recently imposed new trade restrictions on China, including significant tariff increases announced on September 13, 2024. Such actions could provoke retaliatory measures from China, potentially in the form of additional export controls.\n\n**Factors increasing the probability:**\n\n- **Trend of Increasing Restrictions:** China has been progressively expanding its export controls on critical materials, aligning with its national security and economic strategies.\n  \n- **Ongoing Trade Tensions:** The recent U.S. tariffs and sanctions increase the likelihood of China responding with further export restrictions.\n  \n- **Strategic Use of Resources:** China's dominance in the production and processing of critical metals positions it to leverage export controls as a diplomatic tool.\n  \n- **Speculation on Tungsten and Other Metals:** Industry experts predict that metals like tungsten could be targeted next, given their strategic importance and China's significant control over their global supply.\n\n**Factors decreasing the probability:**\n\n- **Limited Time Frame:** With only about two months remaining, the window for China to announce new export restrictions is relatively short.\n  \n- **Lack of Specific Announcements or Leaks:** There are no concrete indications or official statements from Chinese authorities suggesting imminent new restrictions within this time frame.\n  \n- **Potential Strategic Timing:** China may choose to pace its export restrictions to maximize strategic impact, possibly delaying further announcements until after the new year.\n\n**Balancing these factors:**\n\nGiven the pattern of China's past actions and the current geopolitical climate, there is a meaningful chance that China could announce new export restrictions before January 1, 2025. However, the limited time frame and absence of specific indicators reduce the likelihood.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 35%**", "probability": 35}
