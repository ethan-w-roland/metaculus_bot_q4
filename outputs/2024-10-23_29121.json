{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill BigBear.AI file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-23\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before January 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBigBear.ai, which provides AI decision solutions to government and private clients, has run at operating losses since 2020 and in Q1 2024 raised capital by issuing $53.9 million in net new stock. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of BigBear.ai filing for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, here are some key points from the provided sources:\n\n## Financial Performance\n- As of March 31, 2024, BigBear.ai reported a significant net loss of $125,147,000, which is a substantial increase from the net loss of $26,214,000 in the same period of 2023. This includes a goodwill impairment of $85,000,000, which is a major contributor to the net loss.\n\n## Liquidity and Cash Flow\n- Despite the significant net loss, the company believes that its current cash balance of $81,412,000 as of March 31, 2024, along with cash generated from operating activities, will be adequate to meet its anticipated uses of cash flow for the next 12 months. This includes payroll obligations, working capital, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures, and debt service costs.\n\n## Debt and Financing\n- BigBear.ai has a Credit Agreement with Bank of America, but as of March 31, 2024, the company had not drawn on the Senior Revolver. The company also has 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026, which could impact its financial obligations in the future.\n\n## Recent Acquisitions and Transactions\n- The company has recently acquired Pangiam, which has added to its transaction expenses and has been factored into the pro forma financial results. However, this acquisition does not seem to have immediately improved the company's financial health.\n\nGiven these points:\n\n- **Financial Struggles**: The company is experiencing significant financial difficulties, including a large net loss and goodwill impairment.\n- **Liquidity**: Despite these challenges, the company currently believes it has sufficient cash and projected cash flow to meet its obligations for the next 12 months.\n- **Debt Obligations**: The presence of convertible notes and other debt obligations could add pressure, but there is no indication that these obligations are immediately unmanageable.\n\nBased on the available information, it is not clear whether BigBear.ai will file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025. The company's current liquidity position and projected cash flow suggest it may avoid immediate bankruptcy, but ongoing financial struggles and potential future challenges could still pose significant risks. Therefore, the answer to whether BigBear.ai will file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, cannot be definitively determined as yes or no with the provided information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major clients terminated their contracts with BigBear.ai in the past six months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any major clients terminating their contracts with BigBear.ai in the past six months. The sources discuss various aspects of BigBear.ai's business, including financial results, new agreements, and acquisitions, but do not indicate any contract terminations by major clients.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has BigBear.ai publicly announced plans to file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThere is no indication in the provided sources that BigBear.ai has announced plans to file for bankruptcy. The sources discuss financial results, mergers, and other business activities, but there is no mention of bankruptcy plans.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has BigBear.ai's cash reserves significantly decreased since March 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, there is no indication that BigBear.ai's cash reserves have significantly decreased since March 31, 2024. The sources only provide financial data up to March 31, 2024, and do not include any information on the company's cash reserves after that date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has BigBear.ai secured new financing or investments since April 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of BigBear.ai securing new financing or investments since April 2024. The sources discuss various financial and operational aspects of the company, including its acquisition of Pangiam, its financial performance, and a recent contract award from the U.S. Army, but they do not specify any new financing or investments after April 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has BigBear.ai's credit rating been downgraded to a level suggesting a high risk of default?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no direct information indicating that BigBear.ai's credit rating has been downgraded to a level suggesting a high risk of default. The sources discuss various financial and operational aspects of BigBear.ai, including goodwill impairment, debt structures, and compliance with credit agreements, but they do not mention a specific credit rating downgrade for the company.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has BigBear.ai failed to meet any of its financial obligations, such as payroll or supplier payments, in the past six months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that BigBear.ai has failed to meet its financial obligations such as payroll or supplier payments in the past six months. The financial reports and press releases discuss various financial metrics, including revenue, net loss, cash balance, and operating expenses, but they do not mention any defaults on payroll or supplier payments.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is BigBear.ai currently in default on any of its debt obligations?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that BigBear.ai is currently in default on any of its debt obligations.\n\n- The SEC filing from BigBear.ai Holdings, Inc. mentions that as of June 30, 2024, the company was compliant with the covenant requirements of its debt agreements.\n- There is no mention of any default in the other sources, which discuss the company's debt levels and financial health but do not indicate a default.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the AI industry experienced a significant downturn impacting companies similar to BigBear.ai since April 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication of a significant downturn specifically impacting the AI industry as a whole since April 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- Despite general market volatility and challenges faced by some tech companies, AI-focused start-ups have continued to attract substantial funding. From April to June 2024, AI start-ups in the U.S. received $27.1 billion in investments, which is nearly half of all U.S. start-up funding during that period.\n\n- The tech sector, including companies involved in AI, has faced various challenges such as market corrections, layoffs, and regulatory issues. However, these challenges are not exclusively or specifically targeting the AI industry.\n\n- There is concern about an AI-fueled stock market bubble and potential future corrections, but these predictions are for later periods, such as 2026, and not indicative of a current downturn specific to the AI industry.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has BigBear.ai been involved in any significant lawsuits or legal actions that could impact its financial stability?\nANSWER: Yes, BigBear.ai has been involved in significant lawsuits and legal actions that could impact its financial stability.\n\n1. **Investigation by Johnson Fistel**: There is an ongoing investigation by Johnson Fistel, LLP, a shareholder rights law firm, to determine if BigBear.ai or its executives violated federal securities laws by misrepresenting or failing to disclose material, adverse information to investors. This investigation is related to significant losses in stock value following the company's fourth-quarter 2021 earnings report.\n\n2. **Weiss v. BigBear.AI Holdings, Inc.**: A case filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which indicates ongoing legal proceedings. While the details of the case are not extensively outlined in the provided source, the existence of the lawsuit itself suggests potential legal and financial implications.\n\nThese legal actions and investigations could have financial implications for the company, including potential settlements, legal fees, and damage to investor confidence.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has BigBear.ai's stock price declined by more than 50% in the past six months?\nANSWER: To determine if BigBear.ai's stock price has declined by more than 50% in the past six months, we need to look at the stock price changes over this period.\n\nAs of June 27, 2024, the stock price of BigBear.ai was $1.49.\nAs of October 22, 2024, the stock price was $1.71, but it had fluctuated significantly in the recent period.\n\nHowever, to assess the decline over the past six months, we need to compare the current price to the price around April or May 2024. Here are some key points:\n\n- In the first half of 2024, BigBear.ai's stock had fallen by around 26% from its 2023 highs, with the stock price being significantly higher earlier in the year.\n- Specifically, as of April 2024, the stock was mentioned to have fallen by around 26% from its 2023 highs, but the exact price at that time is not provided in the sources. However, given that the stock was around $1.49 in June and has fluctuated since then, it suggests that the decline from the peak in 2023 to the current price is substantial.\n\nGiven the information that the stock fell by around 26% in the first half of 2024 and considering the fluctuations and overall trend, it is clear that the stock has experienced a significant decline. However, the exact percentage decline from the peak six months ago to the current price is not explicitly stated in the sources.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is **UNCLEAR** whether the stock price has declined by more than 50% in the past six months, as we do not have the precise starting price for the six-month period.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: Approximately 70 days (from October 23, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed**: If current conditions remain the same, BigBear.ai would likely **not** file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: With about 17 days remaining, the probability of bankruptcy would be lower due to the short time frame. I would forecast a probability of around **5%**.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left**: Extending the time frame to approximately 280 days (up to July 2025), the probability of bankruptcy would increase. I would forecast a probability of around **25%**.\n\n**Rationale**:\n\nBigBear.ai is facing financial challenges, including significant net losses and goodwill impairment. The company reported a substantial net loss of $125 million for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, largely due to an $85 million goodwill impairment. However, as of that date, BigBear.ai had a cash balance of $81.4 million and stated that it believes this, along with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet its obligations for the next 12 months.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n- **Liquidity Position**: Despite losses, the company maintains a significant cash reserve, suggesting it can meet short-term obligations.\n\n- **No Immediate Defaults**: There is no evidence that BigBear.ai has defaulted on any debt or financial obligations recently.\n\n- **Industry Context**: The AI industry continues to attract investment, and BigBear.ai has secured contracts, such as the $14.8 million U.S. Army Global Force Information Management system award in August 2024.\n\n- **Legal Actions**: The company faces legal investigations, which could pose financial risks, but there is no indication of immediate impact severe enough to trigger bankruptcy within the short time frame.\n\nGiven these factors and the relatively short period until January 1, 2025, the probability of BigBear.ai filing for bankruptcy before that date is low but not negligible. Unexpected events could occur, but based on current information, the company appears to have sufficient resources to avoid bankruptcy in the next 70 days.\n\n**Probability: 10%**", "probability": 10}
