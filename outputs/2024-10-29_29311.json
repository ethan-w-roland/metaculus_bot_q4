    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill a European Union ban into non-commercial internal combustion engines take effect before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the sale of internal combustion engines to individual, non-commercial customers is no longer allowed in any country of the European Union before January 1, 2025. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- The ban must cover all combustion engines that rely on fuels that emit CO2 on combustion, including carbon-neutral diesel. Combustion engines relying on fuels that do not produce CO2 when burned, such as hyrdogen combustion engines, do not need to be banned.\n\n- If exceptions to this ban exist, they must permit vehicles that constituted less than 5% of the total non-commercial vehicle sales in the EU during the previous calendar year.\n\n- If more than half of the European Union member countries leave the EU, or countries representing more than half the EU population in January 2024 leave the EU, the question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nCurrently, the European Union plans on [banning new petrol and diesel cars from 2035](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20221019STO44572/eu-ban-on-sale-of-new-petrol-and-diesel-cars-from-2035-explained).\nHowever, the last EU election resulted in [record seats for far-right parties and collapse of green parties](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/06/10/european-election-results-a-more-conservative-parliament-under-pressure-from-far-right_6674360_4.html); and [the current biggest EU lawmaker group](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/biggest-eu-lawmaker-group-wants-2035-combustion-car-ban-revised-draft-shows-2024-07-02/) and [some countries and carmakers](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/09/25/italy-germany-join-carmakers-in-call-to-rethink-internal-combustion-engine-ban) are trying to allow carbon-neutral fuel and petrol cars, with technical measures to not work with normal petrol and gas, to continue to be sold after the ban.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information available, the European Union ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine cars is not scheduled to take effect before January 1, 2025.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n- The EU has set a ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine cars to take effect on January 1, 2035. This ban is part of the EU's efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and achieve zero-emission targets.\n- There are no indications or plans to implement this ban earlier than 2035. Instead, there have been discussions and efforts by some EU member states, such as Germany and Italy, to relax or modify the targets, including allowing the use of synthetic 'e-fuels' in internal combustion engines after the 2035 deadline.\n- The current emissions regulations and targets, including the Euro 7 standard set to come into effect in 2025, impose stricter emission limits but do not constitute a ban on the sale of internal combustion engines before 2035.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the ban on non-commercial internal combustion engines will not take effect before January 1, 2025.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the European Union officially advanced the implementation date of the internal combustion engine ban to before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe European Union has not advanced the implementation date of the internal combustion engine ban to before January 1, 2025. The ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine cars is still set for 2035, with an allowance for vehicles that run on carbon-neutral fuels (e-fuels) to be sold beyond that date.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any influential EU policymakers or political parties publicly called for advancing the internal combustion engine ban to before 2025?\nANSWER: No, there is no indication in the provided sources that any influential EU policymakers or political parties have publicly called for advancing the internal combustion engine ban to before 2025. Instead, the sources discuss efforts to delay or modify the existing targets and bans, such as allowing the use of e-fuels beyond 2035 or reconsidering the 2035 ban due to industry challenges.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any EU member state enacted a ban on the sale of new non-commercial internal combustion engine vehicles effective before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: No EU member state has enacted a ban on the sale of new non-commercial internal combustion engine vehicles that is effective before January 1, 2025.\n\nThe sources indicate that the EU as a whole has set a target to ban the sale of new internal combustion engine cars by 2035, with some exceptions for vehicles running on CO2-neutral fuels (e-fuels).\n\nWhile some cities and regions within EU member states have implemented or planned bans on certain types of vehicles, none of these bans at the national level for non-commercial vehicles are set to take effect before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any current legislative proposals within the EU to ban the sale of non-commercial internal combustion engine vehicles before 2025?\nANSWER: No, there are no current legislative proposals within the EU to ban the sale of non-commercial internal combustion engine vehicles before 2025.\n\nThe EU legislation, as part of the \"Fit for 55\" package, sets a target for zero CO2 emissions for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 2035, with intermediate emissions reduction targets for 2030, but it does not include a ban before 2025.\n\nAdditionally, recent discussions and agreements have focused on the 2035 deadline, including exceptions for vehicles running on carbon-neutral fuels (e-fuels), but there is no mention of a ban before 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major EU automobile manufacturers pledged to cease production of internal combustion engine vehicles before 2025?\nANSWER: No major EU automobile manufacturers have pledged to cease production of internal combustion engine vehicles before 2025, although some have set earlier targets for significant transitions to electric vehicles.\n\n- Volkswagen and Audi plan to sell the last vehicle with an internal-combustion engine in Europe by 2033, not before 2025.\n- Stellantis is investing heavily in electrification and aims to offer 100% battery electric passenger car sales in Europe by 2030, but there is no mention of ceasing internal combustion engine production before 2025.\n- BMW and other manufacturers are transitioning to electric vehicles, but there is no indication that they will stop producing internal combustion engines before 2025.\n\nThus, while there is a significant shift towards electrification, no major EU automobile manufacturer has committed to stopping the production of internal combustion engine vehicles before 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does EU law permit member states to impose stricter environmental regulations than those mandated by the EU?\nANSWER: Yes, EU law does permit member states to impose stricter environmental regulations than those mandated by the EU. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The Environmental Crime Directive, while setting EU-wide minimum rules, allows member states to provide additional criminal sanctions for other laws with the objective of environmental protection. This implies that member states have the authority to go beyond the minimum requirements set by the EU.\n\n- The directive does not have direct effect, and member states are required to transpose it into their national laws, which gives them the flexibility to implement stricter measures if they choose to do so.\n\nThis flexibility aligns with the general principles of EU environmental policy, which encourage member states to take more stringent measures to protect the environment.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there substantial public support in the EU for an immediate ban on non-commercial internal combustion engine vehicles?\nANSWER: The information available does not indicate substantial public support specifically for an immediate ban on non-commercial internal combustion engine vehicles in the EU. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Political and Industrial Views**: The debate on the ban is largely driven by political and industrial stakeholders. While some companies and environmental groups support the ban, others, including significant EU member states like Germany and Italy, have pushed for exemptions or revisions to the policy.\n\n2. **Public Opinion**: There is no clear data or mention of widespread public opinion or surveys that indicate substantial public support for an immediate ban on non-commercial internal combustion engine vehicles.\n\n3. **Criticism and Support**: The discussions highlight criticism from climate groups and some car manufacturers against allowing exemptions, but also show resistance from other groups, including some EU member states and industry lobbies.\n\nGiven the lack of specific information on public opinion, the answer to whether there is substantial public support for an immediate ban is unclear.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there legal barriers that would prevent the EU from enacting a ban on internal combustion engines before 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, there are no legal barriers mentioned that would prevent the EU from enacting a ban on internal combustion engines before 2025, but there are several factors and agreements that make such a ban unlikely or complicated:\n\n1. **Existing Legislation**: The EU has already set a ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine cars for 2035, not before 2025. This legislation has been agreed upon and is in the process of being implemented.\n\n2. **Recent Agreements**: Germany and other EU countries have negotiated an exception to allow the sale of internal combustion engine cars beyond 2035 if they run on carbon-neutral fuels. This indicates that any changes to the existing timeline would require significant negotiations and agreements among EU member states.\n\n3. **Current Targets and Regulations**: The EU's current targets and regulations, including the Euro 7 vehicle-emissions regulations, are set to come into effect by 2025 but do not include a ban on internal combustion engines before that date. Instead, they focus on reducing emissions and transitioning to zero-emission vehicles by 2035.\n\nGiven these points, while there are no explicit legal barriers mentioned, the existing legislative framework and agreements make it unlikely that the EU would enact a ban on internal combustion engines before 2025.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as there are no explicit legal barriers mentioned, but the current legislative and agreement framework makes such a ban unlikely).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant technological advancements making it feasible for the majority of EU citizens to transition to non-internal combustion vehicles before 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are indeed significant technological advancements and policy changes that are making the transition to non-internal combustion vehicles more feasible, although the majority of EU citizens transitioning to these vehicles before 2025 is still a challenging target.\n\nHere are some key points:\n\n- The EU has set stringent emission standards, with intermediate targets for 2025 and a goal of 100% zero-emission vehicles by 2035. This has driven a significant increase in the sales of electric and hybrid vehicles, with electric vehicles already representing over 14.6% of new car sales in the EU as of 2023.\n\n- There has been a rapid expansion in charging infrastructure, with the number of publicly accessible recharging points more than doubling between 2021 and 2023, and plans to ensure that charging infrastructure continues to grow in line with the electric vehicle fleet.\n\n- Technological advancements have improved the efficiency and range of electric vehicles, with average recharging speeds more than tripling since 2011 and the availability of fast chargers increasing.\n\n- Despite these advancements, achieving a majority transition to non-internal combustion vehicles before 2025 remains ambitious. The targets for 2025 involve significant increases in the share of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), with manufacturers needing to raise their BEV sales share from about 16% in 2023 to approximately 28% by 2025.\n\nGiven these points, while there are substantial technological and infrastructural advancements, the transition for the majority of EU citizens to non-internal combustion vehicles before 2025 is still a stretch.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent EU policy changes in response to environmental emergencies that accelerated previously set timelines?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent EU policy changes in response to environmental emergencies that have accelerated or introduced new timelines and flexibilities.\n\n1. **EU Civil Protection Mechanism and Emergency Responses**: The EU has been actively preparing for and responding to extreme weather events, such as floods and wildfires, which have become more frequent due to climate change. This includes immediate responses and lessons learned from recent deployments to improve future preparedness.\n\n2. **Nature Restoration Law**: The Regulation on Nature Restoration, which came into force in August 2024, sets binding targets for restoring degraded ecosystems by specific deadlines, such as restoring at least 20% of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030 and all ecosystems needing restoration by 2050. This law accelerates the timeline for nature restoration and biodiversity recovery.\n\n3. **Amendments to EU Funds for Climate-Related Disasters**: The European Commission has proposed amendments to several EU regulations (including the European Regional Development Fund, Cohesion Fund, and European Social Fund Plus) to allow for quicker mobilization of funds in response to climate-related disasters. These changes provide additional flexibility and immediate liquidity to affected Member States, effectively accelerating the response and recovery processes.\n\nThese changes indicate that the EU has indeed accelerated and introduced new timelines in response to environmental emergencies.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately **2 months and 3 days** remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf the current situation remains unchanged, **the ban will not take effect before January 1, 2025**, and the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith about **15 days left**, the probability of the ban taking effect would be even lower due to the limited time for any legislative changes to occur. I would forecast a probability of **less than 1%**.\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nWith approximately **8 months** until the deadline, there would still be insufficient time given the legislative processes and current political climate. I would forecast a probability of around **2%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Current Legislative Timeline:**\n   - The **EU has set a ban** on the sale of new internal combustion engine (ICE) cars to take effect **from 2035**, not before January 1, 2025.\n   - There are **no official proposals or indications** of advancing this ban to an earlier date.\n\n2. **Political Climate:**\n   - Recent EU elections have seen **increased representation of conservative and far-right parties**, which are generally **less supportive** of accelerated environmental regulations.\n   - **Key member states** like **Germany and Italy** have expressed **reservations** about the 2035 ban, pushing for exemptions or revisions rather than accelerations.\n\n3. **Legislative Process:**\n   - Enacting an EU-wide ban requires a **complex and time-consuming legislative process**, including proposals, negotiations, and approvals from multiple EU bodies and member states.\n   - With **only 2 months remaining**, there is **insufficient time** for such a process to result in a ban taking effect before January 1, 2025.\n\n4. **Lack of Precedent:**\n   - No EU member state has independently enacted a ban on the sale of new non-commercial ICE vehicles effective before January 1, 2025.\n   - **Automobile manufacturers** have not announced plans to cease production of ICE vehicles before 2025.\n\n5. **Technological and Infrastructural Constraints:**\n   - While there is progress in electric vehicle (EV) technology and infrastructure, a **full transition** for the majority of EU citizens by January 2025 is **not feasible**.\n   - The **market share** of EVs, though growing, is **not sufficient** to support such a sudden ban.\n\n6. **Public Support and Economic Considerations:**\n   - There is **no substantial public support** or demand for an immediate ban on ICE vehicles.\n   - Economic factors, such as the impact on the automotive industry and consumers, make an abrupt ban unlikely.\n\n7. **Potential for Unexpected Events:**\n   - While unexpected environmental emergencies can prompt policy changes, there is **no indication of imminent legislative action** that would result in a ban before 2025.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the current information, legislative timelines, political climate, and practical constraints, the probability of the European Union implementing a ban on the sale of non-commercial internal combustion engine vehicles before January 1, 2025, is **extremely low**.\n\n**Probability: 1%**",
