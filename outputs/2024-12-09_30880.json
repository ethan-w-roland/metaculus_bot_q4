    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Nikola Corporation file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-09\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Nikola Corporation files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before January 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nNikola Corp (formerly Nikola Motor Company) has been on many analysts' and investors' lists of being near bankruptcy for several months. ([Example 1](https://investorplace.com/2024/05/3-ev-stocks-nearing-bankruptcy-time-to-cut-your-losses/).) ([Example 2](https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2023/12/15/with-81-bankruptcy-chance-per-macroaxis-nikola-stock-is-not-cheap/).) However, others [say](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nikola-stock-2025-forecast:-will-nkla-go-bankrupt-or-become-a-multibagger) Nikola might hold on for at least a few more quarters.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Nikola Corporation filing for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Financial Health and Bankruptcy Probability\n- Nikola Corporation's probability of bankruptcy is estimated to be very high, with one source indicating it is over 85% within the next 24 months[1][2].\n- The calculations are based on various financial metrics, including the Altman Z-Score, Beneish M-Score, financial position, and macroeconomic environments[2].\n\n## Cash Burn and Funding Issues\n- Nikola Corporation has been experiencing significant cash burn, with an increase of 10% in cash usage sequentially to $162.9 million in the last reported quarter. Management has warned that funds may run out in Q1/2025, which could necessitate additional dilution through the issuance of new shares[4].\n\n## Reverse Stock Split\n- The company recently underwent a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-30, effective June 25, 2024, which was intended to increase the stock price per share but does not address the underlying financial issues[3].\n\n## Risk Factors\n- Nikola faces numerous risk factors, including debt and financing risks, legal and regulatory risks, production costs, and competition, all of which can exacerbate its financial distress[5].\n\nGiven these points, while the exact timing of a potential bankruptcy filing is uncertain, the indicators suggest a high likelihood of financial distress for Nikola Corporation in the near future. However, whether this will result in a formal bankruptcy filing before January 1, 2025, cannot be definitively determined from the available information.\n\n### Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- The high probability of bankruptcy and the company's current cash burn rate suggest that financial distress is imminent, but the exact timing of a bankruptcy filing depends on various factors, including any potential last-minute financing or restructuring efforts.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The current economic and market conditions, as well as the specific financial health of Nikola Corporation, are critical in assessing this risk.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Other companies in similar financial straits have historically had a high likelihood of filing for bankruptcy protection, but each case is unique.\n\nIn summary, while the likelihood of Nikola Corporation facing financial distress is very high, the precise timing of a potential bankruptcy filing before January 1, 2025, remains uncertain and cannot be conclusively determined from the provided information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nikola Corporation missed any debt payment deadlines in the past year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of Nikola Corporation missing any debt payment deadlines in the past year. The sources discuss various financial activities, earnings reports, and debt obligations, but they do not indicate any missed debt payments.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nikola Corporation announced any significant cost-cutting measures in the last quarter?\nANSWER: YES\n\nNikola Corporation has announced significant cost-cutting measures. In October, the company cut 135 jobs as part of its efforts to control costs and ensure long-term viability. This decision was described by CEO Steve Girsky as a necessary step to adjust and rescale the company's staffing needs[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nikola Corporation's credit rating been downgraded by any major rating agency in 2024?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not include information about Nikola Corporation's credit rating being downgraded by any major rating agency in 2024. The sources discuss various financial challenges, stock performance, and other aspects of Nikola Corporation, but they do not mention a credit rating downgrade by a major rating agency such as Moody's or Fitch.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nikola Corporation's stock price declined by more than 50% in 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, Nikola Corporation's stock price has declined by more than 50% in 2023.\n\nAccording to the sources, Nikola's stock price had dropped significantly, with one article mentioning that the stock was \"down more than 90% from its pandemic peaks\" and another stating that by early June 2023, the stock had losses reaching 75%[3][4]. This indicates a decline of more than 50% in 2023.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nikola Corporation reported a net operating loss in its latest quarterly earnings?\nANSWER: YES, Nikola Corporation has reported a net operating loss in its latest quarterly earnings. For the third quarter of 2024, the company reported a net loss of $199.78 million and an operating loss, as indicated by the operating expenses and net income figures[2][3][5]. Specifically, the operating income for Q3 2024 was negative, reflecting an operating loss[2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nikola Corporation issued new shares to raise capital in the last six months?\nANSWER: Yes, Nikola Corporation has issued new shares to raise capital in the last six months.\n\n- On December 6, 2023, Nikola announced its intention to offer $100 million of common stock and other financial instruments to raise capital[3][4].\n- In October 2024, Nikola updated its equity distribution agreement with Citigroup, allowing it to sell common stock shares totaling up to $237.6 million[1].\n- Additionally, Nikola managed to secure $65 million by selling stock to holders of its convertible notes in the recent period[4].\n\nThese actions indicate that Nikola has indeed issued new shares to raise capital within the last six months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nikola Corporation secured additional financing or funding since June 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are indications that Nikola Corporation has taken steps to secure additional financing, although the specifics of successful funding securing are not explicitly stated.\n\n- In June 2024, Nikola filed a prospectus supplement for the sale of up to $237.6 million in newly issued common shares into the open market, which is a clear attempt to raise additional capital[1].\n- The company also proposed a reverse stock split to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and to secure future capital, which was part of their efforts to sustain the business financially[3].\n\nWhile these actions indicate efforts to secure financing, they do not confirm whether the funding has been successfully secured. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the CEO or CFO of Nikola Corporation publicly indicated that bankruptcy is a possibility?\nANSWER: Yes, the leadership of Nikola Corporation has indicated that bankruptcy or financial distress is a possibility.\n\nIn a report, Nikola Corporation warned that it may have to \"terminate our operations\" in the next 12 months due to \"continuing losses for the foreseeable future,\" which suggests a substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue its operations[4].\n\nAdditionally, the company's financial disclosures and analyses highlight a high probability of financial distress, with probabilities of bankruptcy ranging from 76.76% to over 85% in the next 24 months[1][3]. While these specific percentages are from financial analyses rather than direct statements from the CEO or CFO, the overall context of significant financial challenges and the need to raise additional funds implies that bankruptcy is a considered risk.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any major creditor of Nikola Corporation initiated legal action for repayment in the past six months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence of legal actions involving Nikola Corporation and its former CEO, Trevor Milton, but these do not necessarily involve a major creditor initiating action for repayment in the past six months.\n\n- The sources discuss various legal actions, including a court denying a motion to dismiss claims against Nikola and its officers, SEC proceedings, and arbitration awards against Milton. However, these actions are primarily related to securities fraud, breach of fiduciary duties, and other issues rather than repayment by a major creditor[1][2][4].\n\n- There is no specific mention of a major creditor initiating legal action for repayment within the past six months in the provided sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nikola Corporation's cash reserves decreased by more than 20% in the past six months?\nANSWER: To determine if Nikola Corporation's cash reserves have decreased by more than 20% in the past six months, we need to compare the cash reserves from the second quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2024.\n\nAs of the end of the second quarter of 2024, Nikola had approximately $256 million in unrestricted cash reserves[2].\n\nBy the end of the third quarter of 2024, Nikola's cash reserves had decreased to $198 million[1][3][4].\n\nTo calculate the percentage decrease:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage decrease} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Initial amount} - \\text{Final amount}}{\\text{Initial amount}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage decrease} = \\left( \\frac{256 - 198}{256} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage decrease} = \\left( \\frac{58}{256} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 22.66\\%\n\\]\n\nSince the decrease is approximately 22.66%, which is more than 20%, the answer is:\n\nYES",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 22 days (from December 9, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changes:**  \nIf current conditions persist without any significant changes, Nikola Corporation is highly likely to file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025. The company's ongoing financial struggles, including substantial cash burn, declining stock prices, reported net operating losses, and leadership acknowledgment of potential operational termination, indicate an imminent bankruptcy filing.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 5-6 days):**  \n**Probability:** 60%  \nWith a significantly shorter time frame, the window for Nikola to secure unexpected financing or implement last-minute restructuring efforts narrows. However, there's still some possibility, albeit slim, that the company might find an urgent solution to stave off bankruptcy within such a tight deadline.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was four times the time left (approximately 88 days):**  \n**Probability:** 95%  \nExtending the time frame would provide Nikola with additional opportunities to secure financing, restructure debts, or find strategic partnerships to improve its financial standing. However, given the already critical state of the company's finances, the likelihood of bankruptcy remains exceptionally high even with more time.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nNikola Corporation is exhibiting numerous red flags that indicate financial distress, including high cash burn rates, significant stock price declines, reported net operating losses, and public acknowledgments of potential operational termination. While the window until January 1, 2025, is relatively short (22 days), the accumulation of negative financial indicators strongly suggests an impending bankruptcy filing. Alternative scenarios with drastically reduced or increased time frames adjust the probability accordingly, reflecting the influence of available time on potential recovery or failure efforts.\n\n**Probability:** 85%",
