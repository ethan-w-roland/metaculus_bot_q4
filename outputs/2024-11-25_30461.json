    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the year-over-year increase in prices of homes in Baltimore, MD in November 2024 be greater than or equal to 2.0%, according to Zillow?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Zillow reports in its [Housing Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) resource page that its Zillow Home Value Index, Raw  for Baltimore, MD has risen by ≥2.0% for November 2024. If this does not occur, then this resolves as **No**. The figure can be accessed either through observing the Zillow Zillow Home Value Index, Raw (ZHVI) chart or through the CSV file. To download the CSV, under HOME VALUES, make sure Data Type is set to \"ZHVI All Homes (SFR, Condo/Co-op) Time Series, Raw, Mid-Tier ($)\" and Geography is set to \"Metro & U.S.\" The RegionName \"Baltimore, MD\" in the CSV will be used, specifically by looking at the year-over-year increase from November 2023 to November 2024. (First divide current value by prior value, then subtract one, then multiply by 100%.)\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that the instructions on how to access the CSV are provided for convenience only; according to Zillow, \"We make frequent changes to the download paths for CSVs.\" In the event the location of the data has changed, the question resolves based on the new location. The question will resolve as soon as the data is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date and the data has been reported. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. In the event the chart and CSV report different figures, the CSV will take precedence.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Zillow, housing data is updated on the 12th of each month.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if the year-over-year increase in home prices in Baltimore, MD in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 2.0% based on Zillow's data, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Data\nAs of the data available up to June 30, 2024, the average home value in Baltimore, MD had increased by 5.1% over the past year[5].\n\n## Recent Trends\nOther sources indicate that home prices in Baltimore have been increasing, though at varying rates. For example, the median home sold price in October 2024 was up 3.2% from the previous year[1], and another source reported a 7.8% increase in median home prices compared to the previous year as of October 2024[3].\n\n## Forecast and Trends\nWhile there is no specific data from Zillow for November 2024, the general trend suggests that home prices in Baltimore have been rising. However, the exact year-over-year increase for November 2024 is not provided in the available sources.\n\nGiven the consistent increases reported across different sources, it is plausible that the year-over-year increase could remain above 2.0%, but without the exact November 2024 data from Zillow, this cannot be confirmed with certainty.\n\nTherefore, while the trend suggests a likely increase above 2.0%, the answer cannot be definitively stated as yes or no based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Zillow's Housing Data for Baltimore, MD updated for November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the Zillow data for Baltimore, MD is updated only up to June 30, 2024. There is no indication in the sources that the data has been updated to November 2024.\n\n- The Zillow data mentioned in the sources is as of June 30, 2024[1][2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Zillow report any discrepancies between the Zillow Home Value Index chart and the CSV data for Baltimore, MD in recent months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any discrepancies between the Zillow Home Value Index chart and the CSV data specifically for Baltimore, MD in recent months. The sources provide various data points and trends regarding home values in Baltimore, but they do not address any discrepancies between different data formats or sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Zillow make any changes to its data collection or reporting methodology for the Zillow Home Value Index in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Zillow made changes to its data collection and reporting methodology for the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI), but these changes were implemented starting with the January 2023 data release, not specifically in 2024.\n\nAccording to the source, starting with the January 2023 data release, the full ZHVI time series was upgraded to harness the power of the neural Zestimate[5]. This indicates that the methodology change occurred prior to 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the median home price in Baltimore, MD increase by at least 2.0% in October 2024 compared to October 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, the median home price in Baltimore, MD increased by more than 2.0% in October 2024 compared to October 2023.\n\n- According to the Rocket Homes report, the median home sold price in Baltimore was $224,997 in October 2024, up 3.2% from last year[1].\n- Redfin reports a similar increase, with the median sale price of a home in Baltimore up 7.8% compared to last year[2][3].\n\nBoth sources indicate an increase greater than 2.0%.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the overall national trend for home price increases consistent with a 2.0% year-over-year rise in Baltimore, MD?\nANSWER: The overall national trend for home price increases is not consistent with a 2.0% year-over-year rise in the context of the current data.\n\n- Nationally, home prices have increased by 3.4% to 5.1% year-over-year in recent months, as reported by various sources[2][4][5].\n- Specifically, in September 2024, home prices nationwide increased by 3.4% year-over-year[4], and in October 2024, they were up 5.1% year-over-year[5].\n- This national trend indicates a higher rate of increase than a 2.0% year-over-year rise.\n\nTherefore, a 2.0% year-over-year rise in Baltimore, MD, would be lower than the national average and not consistent with the overall national trend.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Zillow Home Value Index for Baltimore, MD increased by at least 2.0% year-over-year in October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the Zillow Home Value Index for Baltimore, MD has seen an increase, but the specific year-over-year change in October 2024 needs to be clarified from the relevant data.\n\nFrom the source about Baltimore, MD housing market trends, it is mentioned that the average Baltimore, MD home value is $188,706, up 5.1% over the past year as of June 30, 2024[2].\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the year-over-year change in October 2024. While the sources do not provide the exact October 2024 data, they do indicate that home values have been increasing. Given that the June data shows a 5.1% increase, it is reasonable to infer that the year-over-year change in October would likely still be above 2.0%, although the exact figure for October is not provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant change in the housing market inventory in Baltimore, MD in 2024?\nANSWER: There have been notable changes and trends in the housing market inventory in Baltimore, MD in 2024, as indicated by the sources:\n\n1. **Increase in Inventory**: As of June 2024, the number of homes for sale in Baltimore increased by 1.9% from May to June, with 4,866 homes on the market[1].\n   - In October 2024, the number of homes for sale increased by 12.0% compared to September, with 3,600 homes available[2].\n\n2. **New Listings and Active Listings**: There was a 12% drop in new home listings in June 2024, but the overall inventory saw a slight increase[1].\n   - Despite the drop in new listings, the total inventory has shown increases in certain periods, such as the 12% increase from September to October 2024[2].\n\n3. **Supply and Demand Dynamics**: The market faces a tight inventory, but there has been a slight increase in supply. For example, the supply saw an 8% increase compared to the previous year[1].\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that there have been significant changes in the housing market inventory in Baltimore, MD in 2024, including both increases and decreases in different periods.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the average home value in Baltimore, MD shown consistent growth in the months leading up to November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the key points regarding the growth of home values in Baltimore, MD leading up to November 2024:\n\n- The median home sold price in Baltimore increased by 3.2% from October 2023 to October 2024, with a median sold price of $224,997 in October 2024[1].\n- Home prices in Baltimore were up 7.8% compared to the previous year, with a median sale price of $221K in October 2024[3].\n- The average home value in the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson region showed a 3.7% increase over the past year, with an average home value of $388,365 as of recent data[2].\n- The Zillow Home Value Index indicated a 5.1% increase in home values over the past year, with an average home value of $188,706 as of June 30, 2024[4].\n- The median home value was reported to be around $205,016, with newer data suggesting an upward trend, and average values in the Baltimore-Columbia-Towson region at $367,861 as of January 31, 2024[5].\n\nThese sources consistently indicate that home values in Baltimore have been increasing over the past year, showing a trend of growth in the months leading up to November 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent policy changes in Baltimore, MD that impact the real estate market in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent policy changes in Baltimore, MD, and the state of Maryland more broadly, that impact the real estate market in 2024.\n\n1. **Maryland State Legislation**: Governor Wes Moore signed several housing bills in 2024, including the Housing Expansion and Affordability Act, the Housing and Community Development Financing Act, and the Renters’ Rights and Stabilization Act. These laws aim to address housing affordability, protect renters, and incentivize the development of new housing units[1][4].\n\n2. **Baltimore County Legislation**: Baltimore County announced plans to introduce legislation to penalize vacant and blighted properties, aiming to incentivize their rehabilitation and redevelopment. This includes establishing a penalty on vacant structures and directing revenue to funds that support affordable housing and community development[2].\n\n3. **Baltimore City Programs**: The BuyIntoBmore Fixed Pricing Program was implemented in Baltimore City, which prioritizes the sale of city-owned vacant buildings and lots to residents, community land trusts, and developers. This program aims to streamline the disposition process and encourage the restoration and use of vacant properties[3].\n\n4. **Executive Order - Reinvest Baltimore**: Governor Wes Moore issued an executive order establishing the Reinvest Baltimore Program, a collaborative effort between the state, Baltimore City, and local organizations to eliminate concentrations of vacant properties, revitalize neighborhoods, and enhance the quality of life for residents in Baltimore City[5].\n\nThese initiatives collectively impact the real estate market by addressing vacant properties, incentivizing development, protecting renters, and promoting affordable housing.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did any major economic events occur in Baltimore, MD between November 2023 and November 2024 that could affect home prices?\nANSWER: Yes, several major economic events and developments in Baltimore, MD, between November 2023 and November 2024 could potentially affect home prices:\n\n1. **Baltimore Region Investment Summit**: Scheduled for June 27, 2024, this summit highlights significant investments in the region, including tech, real estate, and community redevelopment. Such investments can drive economic growth and potentially impact home prices by increasing demand and improving the local economy[1][2][3].\n\n2. **Tech Hub Designation**: The Baltimore Region was designated as one of 31 federal Tech Hubs in the United States in October 2023, positioning it for a share of $10 billion in US CHIPS act federal funding. This designation can attract more businesses, jobs, and investment, which could influence home prices[1][2].\n\n3. **Real Estate and Early-Stage Capital Funding**: In 2023, the Baltimore Region saw $3.4 billion in real estate deals and nearly $1 billion in new early-stage capital funding. These significant economic activities can drive up demand for housing and impact home prices[1][2].\n\n4. **Economic Development Week in Maryland**: Although this event is more statewide, it includes various activities in Baltimore and surrounding counties that focus on economic development, job growth, and business climate improvements. These initiatives can contribute to a stronger local economy, which may affect home prices[5].\n\n5. **Vacant Housing Initiative**: In December 2023, there was a joint agreement to address vacant and abandoned properties in Baltimore City, involving more than $3 billion in public and private financing. This initiative could improve neighborhood conditions and potentially increase property values[3].\n\nThese events and developments suggest a positive economic trajectory for the Baltimore Region, which could have a favorable impact on home prices.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nThe outcome is known today, 2024-11-25, as Zillow typically updates its Housing Data on the 12th of each month.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends continue without any significant market or economic disruptions, the year-over-year increase in home prices in Baltimore, MD, would remain above 2.0%.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only a quarter of the time left (approximately one month before November data), the forecast would still lean towards a high probability of a ≥2.0% increase, given the consistent upward trends in recent months.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith four times the time left (several months before November), assuming no major economic or market shifts occur, the forecast would maintain a strong likelihood of meeting or exceeding the 2.0% threshold based on ongoing growth patterns.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe historical data up to June 30, 2024, shows a robust 5.1% increase in Baltimore home values year-over-year. Recent monthly reports for October 2024 indicate significant growth rates of 3.2% and 7.8%, both well above the 2.0% benchmark. National trends also support this upward trajectory, with national increases ranging from 3.4% to 5.1% year-over-year. Additionally, recent policy changes and economic developments in Baltimore, such as investments from the Baltimore Region Investment Summit and the designation as a federal Tech Hub, are likely to sustain demand and support continued price growth. Given that Zillow updates its data on the 12th of each month, the November 2024 data should be available by the resolution date, reflecting these positive trends. Unless there are unforeseen negative economic events or significant market shifts between now and the data release, the probability remains high that the year-over-year increase will meet or exceed 2.0%.\n\n**Probability:** 95%",
