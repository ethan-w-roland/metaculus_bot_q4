    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Oregon voters approve Measure 118, which would initiate a universal basic income in the state, funded by corporate tax?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Oregon Measure 118 is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reporting. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Oregon Measure 118, Corporate Tax Revenue Rebate for Residents Initiative (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_118,_Corporate_Tax_Revenue_Rebate_for_Residents_Initiative_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nWhether Oregon voters will approve Measure 118, which proposes a universal basic income (UBI) funded by a corporate tax increase, is uncertain and depends on several factors. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Bipartisan Opposition\nMeasure 118 faces significant bipartisan opposition from both Democratic and Republican leaders in Oregon. They argue that the measure could harm the state budget, essential services, and small businesses. This unified opposition could influence voter decisions.\n\n## Economic Concerns\nCritics of the measure point out potential economic drawbacks, such as increased prices for goods and services, harm to low-income households due to a hidden sales tax effect, and the possibility of businesses relocating to tax-friendly states. These concerns are highlighted by the Oregon Legislative Revenue Office, which estimates a significant reduction in the state's general fund.\n\n## Funding and Distribution\nThe measure would impose a 3% tax on corporate sales above $25 million and distribute the revenue equally among all Oregon residents, including minors and dependents, who have lived in the state for at least 200 days. The estimated annual rebate is $1,600 per resident, funded by approximately $7 billion in new tax revenue.\n\n## Support and Endorsements\nDespite the opposition, Measure 118 has garnered support from some progressive groups and individuals, including significant funding from out-of-state donors. However, some progressive groups have also rescinded their endorsements due to concerns about the measure's potential impact on community resources and economic well-being.\n\n## Public Perception\nThe measure's proponents argue that it would help reduce poverty, stimulate the economy, and promote human dignity by providing a universal basic income. However, the divisive nature of the measure, with both sides presenting strong arguments, makes it difficult to predict the outcome based solely on public perception.\n\n## Historical Context\nMeasure 118 is not the first attempt at increasing corporate taxes in Oregon; a similar measure (Measure 97) was rejected by voters in 2016. This history could influence voter decisions, especially if voters are cautious about the economic implications of such measures.\n\nGiven these factors, the outcome of the vote on Measure 118 is not clear and will depend on how Oregon voters weigh the potential benefits against the potential drawbacks. The answer to whether Oregon voters will approve Measure 118 cannot be determined with certainty based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent polls indicated that a majority of Oregon voters support Measure 118 to implement a universal basic income?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not include recent poll data or specific information on the current level of voter support for Measure 118. Therefore, it is unclear from the available sources whether a majority of Oregon voters support Measure 118.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any prominent progressive organizations in Oregon withdrawn their endorsements of Measure 118?\nANSWER: YES, several prominent progressive organizations in Oregon have withdrawn their endorsements of Measure 118.\n\n- At least four groups that initially backed the measure have since withdrawn their support and are now either neutral or urging voters to oppose it.\n- Progressive organizations such as the Oregon Working Families Party and the Farmworkers Union have withdrawn their endorsements.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do recent surveys show strong public support for universal basic income among Oregon residents?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not include specific data or results from recent surveys that measure public support for universal basic income among Oregon residents. While the articles discuss the proposal, its potential impacts, and the arguments for and against it, they do not present survey results indicating the level of public support.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any similar measure to increase corporate taxes for funding state programs been rejected by Oregon voters in the past, such as Measure 97 in 2016?\nANSWER: Yes, a similar measure to increase corporate taxes for funding state programs was rejected by Oregon voters in the past. Measure 97, which proposed a 2.5 percent tax on the gross annual sales of C corporations in Oregon above $25 million, was defeated by voters in the November 8, 2016, general election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the campaign supporting Measure 118 received less funding than the campaign opposing it?\nANSWER: Yes, the campaign supporting Measure 118 has received less funding than the campaign opposing it.\n\nThe campaign in support of Measure 118, led by \"Oregon People's Rebate,\" reported total contributions of $830,237.19.\n\nIn contrast, the campaign opposing Measure 118, led by \"Defeat the Costly Tax on Sales,\" reported total contributions of over $12.3 million. This significant difference in funding indicates that the opposition campaign has received substantially more funding than the support campaign.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major media outlets in Oregon published editorials opposing Measure 118?\nANSWER: Yes, major media outlets in Oregon have published editorials opposing Measure 118.\n\n- The Oregonian Editorial Board has expressed strong opposition to Measure 118, highlighting its potential to harm the state budget and make Oregon businesses less competitive.\n- The News-Register Editorial Board has also come out against Measure 118, citing its complexities and the potential for it to cut millions from the corporate income tax flow to the state general fund.\n- The East Oregonian Editorial Board and The Source Weekly Editorial Board have similarly expressed concerns and opposition to the measure, focusing on its unintended consequences.\n- Additionally, other editorial boards such as those from The Wall Street Journal and local newspapers have joined in the opposition, emphasizing the measure's flaws and potential negative impacts.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are both the Democratic and Republican parties in Oregon publicly opposing Measure 118?\nANSWER: No, both the Democratic and Republican parties in Oregon are not uniformly opposing Measure 118, although there is significant opposition from individuals and groups within both parties.\n\n- Several Democratic officials, including Gov. Tina Kotek, U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle, State Senate Majority Leader Kathleen Taylor, State Senate President Rob Wagner, State House Majority Leader Ben Bowman, and State House Speaker Julie Fahey, have publicly opposed Measure 118.\n- However, there is no indication that the Democratic Party as a whole has taken an official stance against the measure.\n- On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer has opposed the measure, but again, there is no evidence that the Republican Party in Oregon has issued a unified opposition to Measure 118.\n\nThus, while there is significant opposition from individuals within both parties, it is not a unified party stance. Therefore, the answer is \"NO\".\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Oregon voters generally supportive of measures that increase corporate taxes to fund social programs?\nANSWER: The support for measures that increase corporate taxes to fund social programs among Oregon voters is not uniformly clear from the available sources. Here are some points to consider:\n\n## Support and Opposition\n- Measure 118, which proposes to increase corporate taxes to fund a rebate program for Oregon residents, has both strong supporters and opponents. Supporters argue that it will help reduce poverty and make large corporations pay their fair share, while opponents argue it could lead to higher prices, reduced employment, and a less attractive business environment.\n\n## Public Opinion and Debate\n- The debate around Measure 118 indicates a divided public opinion. Proponents highlight the potential benefits in reducing poverty and providing financial relief to residents, while opponents raise concerns about the economic impacts and the potential strain on state resources.\n\n## Financial Backing and Endorsements\n- The measure has received endorsements from several progressive parties and organizations, but it also faces significant opposition from business groups, labor unions, and some politicians from both parties.\n\nGiven the mixed reactions and the lack of a clear consensus in the sources, it is difficult to determine whether Oregon voters are generally supportive of such measures.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are concerns about negative economic impacts from Measure 118 widely reported in Oregon media?\nANSWER: YES,\n\nConcerns about the negative economic impacts of Measure 118 are widely reported in Oregon media. Here are some key points from various sources:\n\n- The measure is expected to increase prices by 1.3% by 2030 and potentially slow employment growth, as noted by state revenue officials and reported by multiple sources.\n- There are concerns that the tax could be passed on to consumers, leading to higher prices, and that it could burden businesses not directly subject to the tax, particularly small businesses that rely on larger businesses for supplies.\n- The tax could distort supply chains and have a negative impact on industries such as healthcare, where doctors might struggle to pass on the increased costs to insurers or Medicare programs.\n- The measure could reduce funding for essential services like education, healthcare, and public safety by diverting revenue from the Oregon General Fund.\n- There are also concerns about the impact on vulnerable Oregonians, who might lose access to federal benefits like SNAP due to the taxable nature of the rebates.\n\nThese concerns are highlighted in reports from Oregon Public Broadcasting, KLCC, and other media outlets, indicating widespread coverage of the potential negative economic impacts of Measure 118.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Oregon currently facing economic challenges that might increase voter support for a universal basic income program?\nANSWER: While the sources provide a detailed overview of Oregon's economic situation, they highlight several challenges that could potentially influence voter support for a universal basic income program:\n\n1. **High Inflation and Interest Rates**: The economic forecasts mention the impact of high inflation and interest rates, which are affecting household incomes and increasing the cost of living. This could make voters more receptive to programs that provide financial stability.\n\n2. **Economic Uncertainty**: There is a noted uncertainty about the national economy and the potential for a recession, which could exacerbate economic hardships for many Oregonians. This uncertainty might increase support for safety net programs like a universal basic income.\n\n3. **Workforce and Population Challenges**: Oregon is facing challenges related to workforce availability, population stagnation, and an aging population, which could lead to economic instability for some segments of the population. These issues might make voters more inclined to support programs that ensure a basic level of economic security.\n\n4. **High Tax Burden and Regulatory Environment**: The state's high tax burden and regulatory environment are cited as factors that could discourage businesses and individuals, potentially leading to economic hardship for some. This could make voters more open to alternative economic support mechanisms.\n\nGiven these economic challenges, it is reasonable to conclude that Oregon is facing conditions that might increase voter support for a universal basic income program.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\n- Today's date is **November 4, 2024**.\n- The general election, including the vote on Measure 118, is scheduled for **November 5, 2024**.\n- Therefore, there is **1 day** left until the outcome is known.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\n- If nothing changes between now and the election, Measure 118 would most likely **not be approved** by Oregon voters.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\n- A quarter of the remaining time (1 day) is approximately **6 hours**.\n- With only 6 hours left, and considering current trends and opposition, the forecast remains that Measure 118 is **unlikely to pass**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\n- Four times the remaining time (1 day) is **4 days**.\n- Even with 4 additional days, unless there is a significant shift in public opinion or campaigning, Measure 118 would still be **unlikely to pass**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the low probability of Measure 118 being approved:\n\n1. **Bipartisan Opposition:**\n   - Significant opposition from both Democratic and Republican leaders in Oregon, including high-profile officials such as the Governor and legislative leaders.\n   - Bipartisan opposition can heavily influence voter decisions and suggests widespread political concern about the measure.\n\n2. **Economic Concerns:**\n   - Reports from the Oregon Legislative Revenue Office and other analysts highlight potential negative impacts, such as:\n     - Increased prices for goods and services (estimated 1.3% increase by 2030).\n     - Potential job losses or slowed employment growth.\n     - Risk of businesses relocating to states with more favorable tax environments.\n     - Reduction in the state's general fund, affecting essential services like education, healthcare, and public safety.\n\n3. **Withdrawal of Support from Progressive Organizations:**\n   - Several prominent progressive groups have withdrawn their endorsements, including the Oregon Working Families Party and the Farmworkers Union.\n   - Withdrawal of support indicates internal divisions and concerns within groups that might have been expected to back the measure.\n\n4. **Lack of Strong Public Support:**\n   - No recent polls indicate majority support among Oregon voters for Measure 118 or universal basic income funded through corporate taxes.\n   - Without clear public support, the measure faces an uphill battle.\n\n5. **Historical Precedent:**\n   - In 2016, Oregon voters rejected Measure 97, a similar proposal to increase corporate taxes for funding state programs.\n   - Previous rejection suggests voter hesitancy toward such tax increases.\n\n6. **Campaign Funding Disparity:**\n   - The opposition campaign has significantly outfunded the support campaign:\n     - Opposition: Over $12.3 million in contributions.\n     - Support: Approximately $830,237 in contributions.\n   - Funding impacts the ability to reach voters through advertising and grassroots efforts.\n\n7. **Media Opposition:**\n   - Major Oregon media outlets have published editorials opposing Measure 118.\n   - Negative media coverage can sway public opinion against the measure.\n\n8. **Economic Climate:**\n   - While Oregon faces economic challenges that might make a universal basic income appealing, the significant concerns about the measure's funding mechanism and potential economic fallout likely overshadow this appeal.\n\n9. **Uncertainty and Lack of Recent Supportive Data:**\n   - The absence of recent surveys or polls showing strong support for Measure 118 adds to the uncertainty.\n   - Without data indicating a shift in voter sentiment, it's reasonable to infer that opposition remains strong.\n\n10. **Timing:**\n    - With only 1 day left until the election, there is insufficient time for proponents to overcome the substantial opposition and change public opinion.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
