    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill a country change its official name before Jan 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-15\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nFor a name change to be recognized, it must be confirmed by an official declaration from the state but does not need to be validated by major international organizations.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- Only full UN members will be considered. A country has to be a member of the UN during its name change to resolve this question.\n- If an existing country splits into two or more new countries, this question will not resolve if one of them keeps the official name of the original country and remains in the UN.\n- Any change in the official name of the country would resolve this question. For example Greece changing its official name from Hellenic Republic to Republic of Hellas would count.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nChanging a country’s name is relatively rare, typically motivated by political, historical, or national reconciliation reasons. The United Kingdom maintains [a list of such changes it has recognized](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country-names/timeline-of-country-name-changes-in-hmg-use-1919-to-present) for its official communications since 1922.\n\nFor instance, Macedonia changed its name to North Macedonia in 2019 for [diplomatic purposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute). \n\n[This Wikipedia article has a non-exhaustive list of such changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_renaming#Countries).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of a country changing its official name before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Precedents\nSeveral countries have changed their names in recent years for various reasons, including political, cultural, and historical motivations. Examples include Turkey to Türkiye, Czech Republic to Czechia, Swaziland to eSwatini, and the Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia[1][3][5].\n\n## Current Speculations and Processes\n- India is currently speculated to be considering a name change to Bharat, but this would require a constitutional amendment with a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament, which is a significant hurdle[1][4][5].\n- Other countries may be discussing name changes, but none have been officially announced or are in the final stages of implementation as of the latest information.\n\n## Practical and Financial Considerations\nChanging a country's name involves significant practical and financial costs, including updating official documents, signage, and international recognition. This process can be gradual and may take time to implement fully[2][4].\n\n## Base Rates and Time to Resolution\nGiven the complexity and the time required for such changes, the base rate for successful name changes within a short timeframe (less than a year) is relatively low. Most name changes take considerable time and involve extensive political and administrative processes.\n\n## Current State of the World\nAs of now, there is no clear indication that any country is on the verge of officially changing its name before January 1, 2025. The process of changing a country's name is typically lengthy and involves various stakeholders and approvals.\n\nIn summary, while there are ongoing discussions and speculations about potential name changes, the likelihood of a country officially changing its name before January 1, 2025, appears to be low due to the complexity and time required for such changes. Therefore, the answer to whether a country will change its official name before January 1, 2025, is not immediately clear and leans towards \"no\" based on current information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any full UN member state officially declared an intention to change its official name before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any full UN member state officially declaring an intention to change its official name before January 1, 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any government officials in any UN member state announced a planned official name change to occur before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nGovernment officials in the United States, a UN member state, have announced a planned official name change to occur before January 1, 2025. Specifically, the Department of Defense has directed the renaming of nine Army installations by January 1, 2024, as part of the Department of Defense Naming Commission recommendations[2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any country's government passed legislation to change its official name, pending only formal declaration before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any country's government passing legislation to change its official name that is pending only a formal declaration before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss past name changes of various countries, but they do not mention any upcoming name changes that fit the specified criteria.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any full UN member states currently undergoing the legal process required to change their official name?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of any full UN member states currently undergoing the legal process to change their official name. The sources discuss various topics such as UN resolutions, conventions, and organizational changes within the UN, but they do not mention any ongoing name change processes for member states.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any country's parliament scheduled a vote on changing the country's official name before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any country's parliament scheduling a vote on changing the country's official name before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss various elections and parliamentary activities, but they do not address any planned votes on changing a country's official name.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant political movements in any UN member state pushing for an imminent official name change?\nANSWER: There is no information in the provided sources indicating any significant political movements in any UN member state pushing for an imminent official name change. The sources discuss various international and regional political issues, elections, and UN activities, but do not mention any movements or discussions about changing the official name of a UN member state.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a history of countries changing their official names within a short time frame (e.g., less than two months)?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no clear instance of a country changing its official name within a short time frame of less than two months.\n\nThe sources detail various name changes, but all of these changes were implemented over a period that typically involved more than two months, often involving diplomatic notifications, official announcements, and sometimes even international recognition. For example:\n\n- The change from Swaziland to Eswatini was announced in April 2018, but the process and recognition would have taken longer than two months[1][2][4].\n- The change from Macedonia to North Macedonia was finalized in 2019 after the Prespa Accord in 2018, which also involved a longer process[1][3][4].\n- Other name changes mentioned also followed a similar pattern, involving periods of negotiation, announcement, and international recognition that exceeded two months.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as there is no documented instance of a name change within less than two months in the provided sources).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it legally and practically feasible for a full UN member state to change its official name in less than two months?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, changing the official name of a full UN member state involves several steps and approvals, which make it highly unlikely to be completed in less than two months.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n1. **Notification and Approval**: Any change in the name of a UN member state would need to be reflected in various UN records and documents. This would require formal notification and approval from relevant UN bodies, such as the General Assembly or the Security Council[3].\n\n2. **Procedural Timeframe**: The process of changing the name of an NGO, which is a less complex entity compared to a member state, already involves a significant amount of time. For example, requests for name changes by NGOs received before 1 December are reviewed during the Regular Session of the following year, and those received before 1 April are considered during the Resumed Session of the same year[1].\n\nGiven these procedural requirements and the complexity involved in updating official records and obtaining necessary approvals, it is practically and legally infeasible for a full UN member state to change its official name in less than two months.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is India expected to officially change its name to Bharat by January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no clear indication that India will officially change its name to Bharat by January 1, 2025. Here are the key points:\n\n- There have been speculations and discussions about changing the name from India to Bharat, particularly highlighted during the G20 summit and through various official communications[1][3][4].\n- A plea was filed in 2020 to amend the Constitution to replace the word \"India\" with \"Bharat\" or \"Hindustan,\" but there has been no confirmation of such a change being implemented[2].\n- The government has used \"Bharat\" in some official communications, but this does not necessarily mean a formal name change is imminent. Any such change would require a constitutional amendment, which is a complex process involving a super majority and ratification by at least half of the states[3][5].\n\nGiven this information, the answer to whether India is expected to officially change its name to Bharat by January 1, 2025, is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any countries recently resolved disputes that could lead to an official name change before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, several countries have recently resolved disputes or made changes that led to official name changes, some of which occurred before January 1, 2025.\n\n- **Turkey to Türkiye**: In 2022, Turkey officially changed its name to Türkiye, a change announced by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to better represent the country's culture, civilization, and values[3][4][5].\n- **The Republic of Macedonia to North Macedonia**: In 2019, the Republic of Macedonia changed its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, resolving a long-standing dispute with Greece[2][3][4].\n- **Swaziland to Eswatini**: In 2018, Swaziland was renamed Eswatini, a change made to avoid confusion with Switzerland and to reflect the country's cultural identity[2][3][4].\n- **Holland to The Netherlands**: Although not a complete country name change, the Dutch government decided to use \"The Netherlands\" instead of \"Holland\" to avoid associations with recreational drug use and legal prostitution in Amsterdam[3][4].\n\nThese changes were all made to resolve various disputes or to better reflect the countries' identities.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nThere are 46 days remaining from November 15, 2024, to January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changes between now and January 1, 2025, no country will have changed its official name, and the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately 11.5 days remaining (a quarter of the current time), the probability of a country changing its official name would be extremely low, approaching 0%.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith approximately 184 days remaining (four times the current time), there would be slightly more opportunity for a country to change its official name. However, given the rarity of such events and the lack of known impending changes, the probability would still be low, perhaps marginally higher than with 46 days remaining.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Historical Prevalence:**\n   - Country name changes are rare events. Historically, such changes occur infrequently and are often driven by significant political shifts, resolutions of disputes, or changes in governance.\n   - Examples in recent decades include:\n     - **Swaziland** changing to **Eswatini** in 2018.\n     - **Macedonia** becoming **North Macedonia** in 2019.\n     - **Turkey** rebranding internationally to **Türkiye** in 2022.\n\n2. **Time Constraints:**\n   - With only 46 days remaining until the deadline, the time is insufficient for the complex processes required to officially change a country's name.\n   - These processes typically involve:\n     - **Legal Procedures:** Constitutional amendments or legislative acts.\n     - **Administrative Actions:** Updating official documents, signage, and communication.\n     - **International Coordination:** Notifying international organizations (like the UN) and other nations.\n\n3. **Current Indicators:**\n   - **India:** There have been discussions and speculations about India potentially changing its official name to **Bharat**. However:\n     - As of October 2023, there has been no official declaration or initiation of the legal processes required for such a change.\n     - A constitutional amendment would be necessary, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament and ratification by at least half of the state legislatures.\n     - The legislative calendar and political climate make it unlikely for this process to be completed before January 1, 2025.\n\n   - **Other Countries:**\n     - No other UN member states have publicly announced intentions or are known to be in the process of changing their official names within the given timeframe.\n\n4. **Procedural Challenges:**\n   - **Legal Hurdles:** Passing necessary legislation can be time-consuming, often taking months or years.\n   - **Political Consensus:** Such changes usually require broad political agreement, which can be difficult to achieve quickly.\n   - **International Recognition:** While the resolution criteria do not require validation by international organizations, the country itself must complete its internal processes.\n\n5. **Lack of Precedent for Rapid Changes:**\n   - Historically, there are no instances of countries changing their official names within a very short period (e.g., less than two months).\n   - The shortest timelines have still involved several months of preparation and execution.\n\n6. **Adjusted Timeframes:**\n   - **Quarter of the Time Left (11.5 days):**\n     - The probability becomes negligible due to the impracticality of completing necessary steps.\n   - **Four Times the Time Left (184 days):**\n     - While six months provides more time, without current indications of impending changes, the probability increases only slightly.\n     - Any ongoing processes would likely have been publicly announced or reported by now.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - Considering the lack of current announcements, the procedural complexities, and the short timeframe, the probability of a country changing its official name before January 1, 2025, is very low.\n   - Even with more time, unless new information arises indicating an active name change process, the probability remains limited.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 2%**",
