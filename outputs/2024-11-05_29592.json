    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Sadiq Khan cease to be mayor of London before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sadiq Kahn ceases to be mayor of London, England, at any point before January 1, 2025, according to the City of London's [official website](https://www.london.gov.uk/) or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions). Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n\"Ceases to be mayor\" is defined as vacating the office and having a permanent successor. Please note that an announcement alone, such as an announcement of not seeking re-election or an intention to vacate the office at a future date, will not count as ceasing to be mayor. Temporarily being unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office of mayor (due to illness or other reasons causing it to be temporary) will also not count for purposes of this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nMayor Kahn faces periodic calls to resign, such as from foreign policy analyst and former aide to Margaret Thatcher [Nile Gardner](https://x.com/NileGardiner/status/1834588669149110754) in September 2024. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information available, it is highly unlikely that Sadiq Khan will cease to be the mayor of London before January 1, 2025.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n- Sadiq Khan was re-elected as the Mayor of London for a third term on May 2, 2024.\n- The term of the mayor of London is typically four years, and there is no limit to the number of terms served.\n- Since Khan was re-elected in May 2024, his current term will extend beyond January 1, 2025.\n\nTherefore, based on the current information, it can be concluded that Sadiq Khan will not cease to be the mayor of London before January 1, 2025. The answer to the question is likely \"no.\"\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any scheduled elections for the Mayor of London before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO, there are no scheduled elections for the Mayor of London before January 1, 2025. The next election for the Mayor of London was held on May 2, 2024, and the subsequent election will be after this date, following the four-year cycle.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Sadiq Khan currently serving a term that extends beyond January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES, Sadiq Khan is currently serving a term that extends beyond January 1, 2025. He was re-elected as the Mayor of London in the 2024 London mayoral election, which means his new term will continue beyond January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Can the Mayor of London be removed from office by a vote of no confidence or other political process?\nANSWER: No, the Mayor of London cannot be removed from office by a vote of no confidence. According to the sources, the London Assembly does not have the power to remove the Mayor through a no-confidence vote. The Mayor can only be dismissed if they fail to attend six consecutive London Assembly meetings or break the law.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any major political party called for Sadiq Khan's removal before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that any major political party has called for Sadiq Khan's removal before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss his re-election, his policies, and the election campaign, but they do not mention any calls for his removal from office.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Sadiq Khan experienced any health issues that might cause him to step down before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: There is no information in the provided sources indicating that Sadiq Khan has experienced any health issues that might cause him to step down before January 1, 2025.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Sadiq Khan announced any plans to resign as Mayor of London before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Sadiq Khan has announced any plans to resign as Mayor of London before January 1, 2025. In fact, the sources mention his re-election for a third term and his ongoing commitments and plans for the city.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming events or circumstances that might lead to Sadiq Khan ceasing to be Mayor of London before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of any upcoming events or circumstances that would lead to Sadiq Khan ceasing to be the Mayor of London before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss his recent re-election for a third term in 2024 and his ongoing plans and challenges as mayor, but they do not mention any potential reasons for him to leave the office prematurely.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any known legal action or investigation that could force Sadiq Khan to leave office before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any ongoing or pending legal action or investigation that could force Sadiq Khan to leave office before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss his policies, election campaigns, and past controversies, but none indicate any current legal issues that would necessitate his removal from office.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as there is no specific information provided that suggests any imminent legal action or investigation that could force him to leave office.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant political pressure or public demand for Sadiq Khan's resignation?\nANSWER: There is significant political pressure and public demand for Sadiq Khan's resignation in certain contexts.\n\n- Recently, Sadiq Khan has faced criticism and calls for his resignation due to his handling of the Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez) expansion, with some demanding he step down if an independent investigator upholds complaints about his statements on the matter.\n- Additionally, there have been general criticisms and frustrations from various groups and individuals regarding his policies and decisions, such as the council tax increases and his handling of the COVID-19 crisis, although these may not necessarily translate into widespread calls for resignation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has a Mayor of London ever resigned before completing their term?\nANSWER: Yes, a Mayor of London has resigned before completing their term. Boris Johnson, who served as the Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016, did not resign in the classical sense but did step down at the end of his second term to pursue other political roles. However, the more relevant example is not Boris Johnson but rather the context of another politician.\n\nAlthough the sources provided do not explicitly mention a Mayor of London resigning mid-term, it is worth noting that the question can be answered by considering the broader context of political resignations. However, in the specific case of the Mayors of London mentioned in the sources, none have resigned mid-term.\n\nHowever, if we consider the broader political landscape and other offices, the principle of resignation before completing a term is well-established in British politics, even if not specifically within the mayoralty of London as described in the sources.\n\nTo directly answer the question based on the provided sources: there is no clear example of a Mayor of London resigning before completing their term mentioned in these sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nThere are 56 days remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, Sadiq Khan would remain the Mayor of London beyond January 1, 2025. Therefore, the outcome would be **No** (he does not cease to be mayor before January 1, 2025).\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only 14 days remaining, the probability of Sadiq Khan ceasing to be mayor before January 1, 2025 would be even lower than the current estimate, approaching zero.\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith 224 days remaining (extending the deadline to mid-June 2025), there would be a slightly higher probability of unforeseen events leading to Sadiq Khan ceasing to be mayor, but it would still be low.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSadiq Khan was re-elected for a third term as Mayor of London on May 2, 2024. His term extends beyond January 1, 2025. There are no scheduled elections or mechanisms in place that would result in him leaving office before that date.\n\nThe Mayor of London cannot be removed from office by a vote of no confidence. He can only be dismissed if he fails to attend six consecutive London Assembly meetings or if he breaks the law. There are no indications that either of these scenarios is likely to occur within the next 56 days.\n\nWhile there have been periodic calls for his resignation and some political pressure—such as criticisms over policies like the Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez) expansion—there are no substantial movements or official proceedings aiming to remove him from office before January 1, 2025.\n\nThere are no reports of health issues or legal actions that might compel him to resign in the given time frame. Historically, no Mayor of London has resigned or been removed from office mid-term.\n\nGiven the short time remaining until January 1, 2025, and the lack of any concrete factors that could lead to his departure from office, the probability of Sadiq Khan ceasing to be mayor before the specified date is extremely low.\n\n**Probability: 1%**",
