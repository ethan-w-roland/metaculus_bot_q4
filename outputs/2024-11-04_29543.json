    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill BirdCast report 1 billion birds flying over the United States at any point before December 1, 2025?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after October 7, 2024, and before December 1, 2025, BirdCast's [Live bird migration maps](https://birdcast.info/migration-tools/live-migration-maps/) tool reports ≥1000.0 million birds in flight simultaneously over the United States. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe time zone for this question is Eastern Time (ET), as that is the one used by BirdCast.\n\nIn case of the resolution source being unavailable or no longer timely updated before the question can resolve, resolution will wait until January 7, 2025 for the bird migration traffic numbers up to November 30, 2024, 23:50 ET to be shown, at which point this question will be **annulled** if the numbers are still not shown.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBirdCast is a [consortium](https://birdcast.info/about/collaborators/) of interdisciplinary researchers, with the three primary institutions being the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Colorado State University's Aeroeco Lab, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, with funding from the National Science Foundation, the Leon Levy Foundation, and Amazon Web Services, among others. Its mission is, according to the [Audubon Society](https://www.audubon.org/news/how-get-most-out-birdcasts-migration-forecasts), to forecast \"the intensity of overnight bird migration across the continental United States, displaying waves of migratory birds on a series of easy-to-read forecast maps.\"\n\nOn the night of October 6-7, 2023, the United States experienced the first billion bird night reported by BirdCast, with Dr. Andrew Farnsworth of The Cornell Lab [posting](https://birdcast.info/news/the-first-billion-bird-night-6-7-october-2023/): \n\n>We will keep this simple – welcome to the billion bird club!\n\n>There is not much more that we can say beyond – in the recorded history of BirdCast, here is the first billion bird night! BILLION! And, as you can see, this epic and grand occasion did not stop at a billion, growing to nearly 1.2 billion!\n\n<img src=\"https://is-birdcast-wordpress-prod-s3.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/mosaic_202310070220.jpg\" />\n\nHowever, as Watt Poultry, a trade journal for the poultry industry, wrote on September 25, 2024, \"[Beware of another billion-bird migration night](https://www.wattagnet.com/poultry-meat/diseases-health/avian-influenza/article/15704378/beware-of-another-billionbird-migration-night)\": \n\n>Now that fall is upon us and wild birds will soon begin their migrations in North America, it is especially important for poultry producers to make sure all biosecurity precautions are being carried out on their farms to prevent infections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\n\n>Emily Pittman, veterinary director, Georgia Poultry Laboratory Network, reminded attendees of the 2024 Georgia Layer Conference on September 23 what day it was, and that in 2023, October 6 was a billion-bird migration night.\n\n>“If you remember last year, this was about when we started having issues (with HPAI) again,” she said.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of BirdCast reporting 1 billion birds flying over the United States before December 1, 2025, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Historical Precedent\n- BirdCast has already reported a night with over 1 billion birds flying, specifically on October 6-7, 2023, when nearly 1.2 billion birds were recorded. This sets a precedent that such high numbers are possible.\n\n## Migration Patterns and Seasons\n- Nocturnal bird migration peaks in the contiguous US from mid-August to mid-November in the fall and from mid-March to mid-June in the spring. These periods are when the highest numbers of birds are typically observed.\n\n## Data Collection and Reporting\n- BirdCast uses radar technology to estimate the total number of birds migrating, and their data feed is live during the migration seasons (March 1 to June 15 in spring and August 1 to November 15 in fall). This ensures that any significant migration events during these periods would be captured and reported.\n\n## Base Rates and Previous Events\n- Given that BirdCast has already reported a billion bird night, the base rate for such an event occurring again is not zero. The fact that it has happened once suggests it could happen again, especially during peak migration seasons.\n\n## Time to Resolution\n- The question spans a period up to December 1, 2025, which includes multiple migration seasons. This extended timeframe increases the likelihood of observing another night with over 1 billion birds flying.\n\nWhile it is impossible to predict with certainty, the historical precedent, the ongoing nature of bird migration, and the capabilities of BirdCast's reporting system all suggest that it is plausible for BirdCast to report another night with 1 billion birds flying over the United States before December 1, 2025. However, the answer is not immediately clear as a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" without real-time data from future migration seasons.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has BirdCast continued regular operation and data reporting up to November 4, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, BirdCast has continued regular operation and data reporting up to November 4, 2024. The sources provide live data feeds and updates for November 4, 2024, indicating that the system is active and reporting data during the fall migration season, which runs from August 1 to November 15.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have technological advancements improved BirdCast's ability to detect higher numbers of migrating birds since October 2023?\nANSWER: The information provided does not specify any technological advancements or updates to BirdCast's capabilities that have occurred since October 2023. The sources discuss the evolution and improvements of BirdCast up to 2022 and early 2023, but they do not mention any changes or enhancements made after October 2023.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are experts predicting another peak migration event exceeding one billion birds before December 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific prediction or mention of an upcoming peak migration event exceeding one billion birds before December 1, 2025. The sources discuss general migration patterns, the timing of peak migrations in different regions, and the importance of reducing light pollution to protect migrating birds, but they do not provide a specific forecast for the number of birds in a future peak migration event.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are nocturnal bird migration numbers during the fall migration season (mid-August to mid-November) typically increasing year over year?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not indicate that nocturnal bird migration numbers during the fall migration season are typically increasing year over year. The information given focuses on the patterns, timing, and factors influencing bird migration, such as weather conditions, geography, and the use of migration dashboards to track and forecast migration. However, there is no data or statement that suggests a year-over-year increase in the numbers of nocturnal bird migrations during the fall season.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any indication that BirdCast will cease operations or reduce data reporting before December 1, 2025?\nANSWER: There is no indication in the provided sources that BirdCast will cease operations or reduce data reporting before December 1, 2025. The sources discuss the ongoing and future operations of BirdCast, including the return of migration tools for the Fall 2023 season and the continuation of live migration data feeds during specific seasonal windows, without any mention of planned cessation or reduction of services.\n\n### NO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has BirdCast reported more than one billion birds in flight over the United States more than once before November 4, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, BirdCast has reported more than one billion birds in flight over the United States multiple times in the past.\n\n- The fall migration alone involves over 4 billion birds moving across the United States, with peak periods in September and October.\n- In the spring, 3.5 billion birds cross back into the U.S. from points south, indicating large-scale migrations that exceed one billion birds on multiple occasions.\n\nThese figures are based on historical data and annual migration patterns tracked by BirdCast.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any environmental factors or climate patterns predicted to increase bird migration numbers before December 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication of environmental factors or climate patterns that are predicted to increase bird migration numbers before December 1, 2025. Instead, the sources highlight various threats and challenges faced by migratory birds due to climate change, habitat degradation, and other human activities, which are expected to continue or worsen.\n\n- Climate change is projected to disrupt migration patterns, reduce bird populations, and increase the risks faced by migratory birds.\n- There is no mention of any factors that would lead to an increase in bird migration numbers; rather, the focus is on the declining trends and increased risks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent instances of extreme weather events that concentrated bird migration routes over the United States?\nANSWER: While the sources provided do not specifically detail recent instances of extreme weather events concentrating bird migration routes, they do discuss how weather and climate changes are impacting bird migration patterns.\n\n- There is mention of how warmer temperatures and changing weather patterns are altering the timing and routes of bird migrations. For example, warmer springs are causing earlier migrations, and some birds are struggling to keep up with these changes.\n- Extreme weather events such as droughts and storms are noted to further disrupt the availability of resources for migratory birds, making their journeys more challenging.\n\nHowever, there is no specific instance mentioned in these sources about extreme weather events concentrating bird migration routes in recent times. Therefore, the answer to whether there have been recent instances of such events is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant declines in North American bird populations reported between October 2023 and November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been significant declines in North American bird populations reported between October 2023 and November 2024, as indicated by the sources provided.\n\n- A study analyzed between 1980 and 2015 and projecting to 2099 shows a modest but significant dip in the number and diversity of birds overall, with larger drops for specialist and migratory groups.\n- Recent data highlights that bird populations in North America have declined by approximately 2.9 billion birds since 1970, which is a loss of more than one in four birds. This decline is ongoing and expected to continue unless changes are made.\n- Specific declines include a 34% loss in grassland birds since 1970, and significant declines in other habitats such as forests and deserts, with only waterbirds showing an increase due to conservation efforts.\n\nThese reports and studies indicate ongoing and significant declines in North American bird populations.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is BirdCast's methodology for estimating bird numbers consistent and unchanged since the last recorded billion-bird night?\nANSWER: The methodology for estimating bird numbers in BirdCast has undergone refinements and improvements, but the core principles have remained consistent. Here are the key points:\n\n- The basic method of using radar data, specifically the reflectivity factor (dBZ), to estimate bird numbers has been consistent since the inception of BirdCast.\n- The team has continued to refine their models and data interpretation, including the use of numerical estimates of bird numbers, which was introduced in 2021.\n- The models combine radar data with meteorological forecasts and have been updated to provide more accurate and detailed information, such as real-time and historical data, and estimates of bird flight directions, speeds, and altitudes.\n\nWhile the core methodology has not changed dramatically, the team has made significant improvements and additions to the tool, particularly in how the data is visualized and interpreted. Therefore, the methodology is not entirely unchanged but has been consistently refined.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as to whether it is completely unchanged, but it is consistent in its core principles).",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 392 days remain until December 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If no additional billion-bird nights are reported by BirdCast before December 1, 2025, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** If only about 98 days remained, the probability would decrease to around **5%**, given the limited time and fewer migration opportunities.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was four times the time left:** With approximately 1,568 days (about 4.3 years) remaining, the probability would increase to around **30%**, due to more migration seasons offering additional opportunities.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Base Rate and Historical Data:**\n  - The first and only billion-bird night reported by BirdCast occurred on **October 6-7, 2023**, when nearly 1.2 billion birds were recorded.\n  - Prior to this event, BirdCast had not reported any nights with over one billion birds in flight.\n  - Since the initial event, up to the current date (**November 4, 2024**), there have been **no additional reports** of billion-bird nights.\n\n- **Migration Seasons and Timing:**\n  - The main periods for high-volume bird migration in the U.S. are:\n    - **Spring Migration:** Mid-March to mid-June.\n    - **Fall Migration:** Mid-August to mid-November.\n  - Within the remaining time frame, there are **two full migration seasons** (Spring and Fall of 2025) during which a billion-bird night could potentially occur.\n\n- **Bird Population Trends:**\n  - Studies indicate significant declines in North American bird populations:\n    - Since 1970, there has been a loss of approximately **2.9 billion birds** (over 29% decline).\n    - Recent reports between October 2023 and November 2024 suggest these declines are ongoing.\n  - Declining populations reduce the likelihood of large-scale migration events reaching the billion-bird threshold.\n\n- **Environmental Factors:**\n  - Climate change and habitat loss are impacting bird migration patterns adversely.\n  - There are **no indications** of environmental factors or climate patterns predicted to **increase** bird migration numbers significantly before December 1, 2025.\n  - Extreme weather events could potentially concentrate migration but also pose risks that may suppress bird numbers.\n\n- **Technological and Reporting Considerations:**\n  - BirdCast's methodology remains consistent, with ongoing refinements improving data accuracy.\n  - There are **no plans** for BirdCast to cease operations or reduce data reporting before the resolution date.\n  - Technological advancements since October 2023 are **unclear**, suggesting no significant changes that would affect detections.\n\n- **Expert Predictions:**\n  - Experts have **not predicted** another peak migration event exceeding one billion birds within the specified time frame.\n  - Without expert forecasts indicating a high likelihood, the probability remains modest.\n\n- **Uncertainties and Possibilities:**\n  - Migration patterns can be influenced by unforeseen factors.\n  - While unlikely, there remains a **non-zero chance** due to natural variabilities in migration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the single occurrence of a billion-bird night, ongoing declines in bird populations, and lack of evidence pointing toward increased future migrations of this magnitude within the next year, the probability is relatively low but not negligible.\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
