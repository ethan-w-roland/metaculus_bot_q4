    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the temperature in Denver, CO remain below 70 degrees F for the entire month of December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-26\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the high temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is below 70 degrees for the Denver International Airport weather station for every day of December 2024, as reported [here](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/hist.phtml?station=DEN&network=CO_ASOS). If this does not occur, then this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nMissing data for any of the observed values (coded by the NWS as \"MM\") will not be considered. No other resolution source other than the Data Calendar posted at Iowa State University will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn December 2022, the highest High was 64 F and in December 2023 it was 71. According to [Iowa State University](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/), \"The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) collects environmental data from cooperating members with observing networks. The data are stored and made available on this website.\" \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the available weather forecasts and historical data for Denver, CO in December, it is highly likely that the temperature will remain below 70 degrees Fahrenheit for the entire month of December 2024.\n\nHere are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The average daytime temperatures in December are expected to be around 7°C to 15°C (45°F to 59°F), with nighttime temperatures often dipping below freezing[1][3][5].\n- The forecasted temperature ranges for December do not exceed 70°F. For example, the highest temperatures mentioned are in the range of 45°F to 55°F (7°C to 13°C) during the day[1][3][5].\n- Historical data and long-term weather averages indicate that December is a cold month in Denver, with significant cooling as the month progresses. The average temperatures at the beginning of December are around 10.9°F (12.7°C), and they drop to around 4.7°F (-15.2°C) by the end of the month[1][2].\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that the temperatures in Denver, CO will not reach 70 degrees Fahrenheit during December 2024. Therefore, the answer to the question is **yes**, the temperature will remain below 70 degrees Fahrenheit for the entire month.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the historical average of daily high temperatures in Denver, CO for December below 70 degrees Fahrenheit?\nANSWER: Yes, the historical average of daily high temperatures in Denver, CO for December is below 70 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nAccording to the sources, the average high temperature in December is around 46°F (7.8°C)[1][4][5]. This is significantly below 70°F.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average high temperature for December 2024 in Denver, CO forecasted to remain consistently below 70 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the month?\nANSWER: Yes, the average high temperature for December 2024 in Denver, CO is forecasted to remain consistently below 70 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the month.\n\n- According to the sources, the average daily high temperatures in December range from around 45°F to 49°F, which is well below 70°F[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the urban heat island effect in Denver, CO likely to raise December temperatures above historical averages?\nANSWER: The urban heat island effect in Denver, CO is primarily discussed in the context of summer months and its impact on temperatures during heat waves. The sources provided do not specifically address the effect of the urban heat island on temperatures in December.\n\n- The articles focus on the summer heat and how the urban heat island effect exacerbates temperatures during this time[1][2][4].\n- There is no mention of how the urban heat island effect influences temperatures in the winter months, including December.\n\nGiven this, the answer to whether the urban heat island effect in Denver is likely to raise December temperatures above historical averages is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do current weather models predict any days in December 2024 in Denver, CO with high temperatures exceeding 70 degrees Fahrenheit?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication that high temperatures in Denver, CO in December 2024 are expected to exceed 70 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n- The forecast from EasyWeather indicates that daytime temperatures are expected to be around 7°C to 15°C (45°F to 59°F) during December[1][2].\n- The Weather2Travel forecast also shows daytime maximum temperatures in the shade to be around 7°C (45°F)[3].\n- The World-Weather.info forecast lists temperatures in Fahrenheit, but none of the days in December 2024 are predicted to have highs above 70°F[5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Denver, CO experienced any December days with high temperatures above 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the past five years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data detailing the high temperatures for each day in the past five years. However, the sources do provide general temperature ranges and averages for December.\n\n- According to the source from Weatherspark, in December, daily high temperatures in Denver typically decrease from 49°F to 45°F and \"rarely falling below 27°F or exceeding 65°F\"[4].\n- There is no mention of high temperatures above 70°F in December in any of the sources.\n\nGiven this information, it is highly unlikely that Denver has experienced any December days with high temperatures above 70 degrees Fahrenheit, but the sources do not provide a definitive answer for the past five years specifically.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the long-term climate trends for Denver, CO shown a significant increase in December temperatures over the past decades?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence to suggest a significant increase in December temperatures for Denver, CO, over the past decades.\n\n- The sources provide historical averages and extremes but do not discuss long-term trends in detail. For example, [1] and [4] give average temperatures for December based on historical data, but they do not indicate any trend of increasing temperatures.\n- [3] mentions the average and extreme temperatures but does not discuss long-term trends.\n- [5] lists historical extremes and averages but does not provide information on trends.\n\nTherefore, the available information does not support the conclusion that there has been a significant increase in December temperatures in Denver over the past decades.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an active El Niño or La Niña event expected to influence Denver, CO's weather in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is a significant likelihood of a La Niña event emerging and influencing the weather in December 2024, but it is not yet active.\n\n- Forecasters predict a 60% chance of La Niña developing in September-November 2024 and persisting through January-March 2025[2][3][5].\n- As of mid-November 2024, ENSO-neutral conditions still prevail, but there is a forecasted transition to La Niña[4].\n\nGiven this information, while La Niña is expected to influence the weather in December 2024, it has not yet become active as of the latest updates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR** (since La Niña is expected but not yet active)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the upcoming snow and cold weather patterns expected to dominate Denver, CO's climate in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it is clear that snow and cold weather are expected to be significant components of Denver's climate in December 2024.\n\n- The forecast indicates that Denver will experience an average of 4 snowy days, with an average snowfall of 29.6 cm during December[1][3][5].\n- Temperatures are expected to be cool, with daytime highs around 7°C (45°F) and nighttime lows often below -4°C (25°F)[1][3][5].\n- The weather patterns include periods of snow showers, light freezing rain, and overall chilly conditions throughout the month[1][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the upcoming snow and cold weather patterns are indeed expected to dominate Denver's climate in December 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any authoritative weather agencies issued forecasts for December 2024 in Denver, CO indicating daily highs below 70 degrees Fahrenheit?\nANSWER: Yes, authoritative weather agencies and reliable weather sources have issued forecasts for December 2024 in Denver, CO, indicating daily highs well below 70 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n- According to the forecast from EasyWeather, the daytime temperatures in Denver for December 2024 are expected to be around 8°C (46°F) at their highest, with significant cooling as the month progresses[1][2].\n- Weather2Travel also indicates that daytime maximum temperatures in Denver in December 2024 will be around 7°C (45°F)[3].\n- The Almanac's 60-Day Extended Weather Forecast for Denver, CO, suggests temperatures that are significantly below 70°F, with periods of sunny and chilly conditions but no highs near 70°F[4].\n\nAll these sources confirm that the daily highs for December 2024 in Denver will be below 70 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant weather anomalies or events anticipated in December 2024 that could impact Denver, CO's temperatures?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, here are some insights into the anticipated weather conditions for Denver, CO in December 2024:\n\n## Temperature Trends\n- The average temperature in Denver during December is expected to be around the historical average, with daytime temperatures reaching up to 7°C (45°F) and nighttime temperatures dipping to as low as -8°C (18°F)[3][5].\n- There is no indication of significant temperature anomalies, as the forecasts suggest temperatures will be close to the historical averages[1][3].\n\n## Precipitation and Snow\n- Denver can expect an average snowfall of 29.6 cm (11.7 inches) over 4 days, which is typical for the month[1][2].\n- There are predictions of some snowy periods, particularly around December 3-6 and later in the month (December 27-31), but these are not described as anomalous[4].\n\n## Other Weather Conditions\n- The forecast includes periods of sunny weather, some snow showers, and occasional light freezing rain, all of which are consistent with typical December weather in Denver[1][4][5].\n\nIn summary, there are no significant weather anomalies or events anticipated in December 2024 that would deviate substantially from the historical norms for Denver, CO.\n\n**NO**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n35 days (from November 26, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf historical patterns and current forecasts continue without significant anomalies, the temperature in Denver, CO, is expected to remain below 70 degrees Fahrenheit for the entire month of December 2024.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith approximately 9 days left in December, if no temperatures above 70°F have been observed so far, the probability of the entire month remaining below 70°F would be even higher, around 98%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nIf there were 140 days left (extending into future months beyond December, though not directly relevant to the December outcome), the forecast would still focus on December specifically. Assuming no significant climate shifts, the probability remains high, around 95%.\n\n**Rationale:**\nDenver, CO, has a strong historical trend of cold December temperatures, with average daily highs well below 70°F. The only recent anomaly was a single day in December 2023 reaching 71°F. Current forecasts for December 2024 align with historical averages, indicating daily highs between 45°F and 59°F. Additionally, expected weather patterns, including snowfall and cold fronts, further reduce the likelihood of temperatures exceeding 70°F. While climate variability and rare temperature spikes are possible, the evidence strongly supports the expectation that Denver will not experience any days in December 2024 with highs above 70°F.\n\n**Probability: 95%**",
