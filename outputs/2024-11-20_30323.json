    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore December 31, 2024, will Tech Crunch report new layoffs at Google or Alphabet?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-20\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to Tech Crunch's tracker \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs,\" which can be accessed [here](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/11/tech-layoffs-2024-list/), Google (or Alphabet) has layoffs following the launch of this question and before December 31, 2024. To resolve the question, a Metaculus Admin will go to the Tech Crunch link on December 31, 2024, and see if Google or Alphabet appears for October 2024, November 2024, or December 2024. If Google or Alphabet are not listed as having a layoff event under those months, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nAs the parent company of Google, Alphabet is an acceptable synonym for Google. Tech Crunch's \"comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" will be the sole source used for resolution of this question, regardless of information from other sources. If a layoff event appears in the time period listed, this question resolves as Yes, and if not, it resolves as No.\n\nFor ease of resolution, in this series of questions, in order to count the Tech Crunch page must specifically list the company in question, which in this case is Google or Alphabet. This is true regardless of subsidiaries or ownerships. So for example, a question on Microsoft must specifically mention Microsoft, and a layoff event at LinkedIn will not count for purposes of this question (unless the subheading mentions Microsoft), even though LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft.\n\nAccording to Tech Crunch, \"Below youâ€™ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2024, to be updated regularly.\" Admins to resolve this question will only be looking to see what is on the page at the time of resolution. If Tech Crunch ceases to publish updates on the resolution source following the launch of this question (regardless of what can be found elsewhere on the Tech Crunch website), this question resolves as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nGoogle is most recently listed in July 2024, with the blurb saying, \"Is reportedly making large cuts globally across several of its Cloud teams, including teams focused on sustainability, consulting and partner engineering.\" Google has also been mentioned in May, April, and January.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of TechCrunch reporting new layoffs at Google or Alphabet before December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Historical Layoff Trends\n- Google has already conducted several rounds of layoffs in 2024, affecting various divisions including engineering, services, voice assistance, and hardware teams. These layoffs have been part of ongoing organizational changes to align resources with product priorities[2][3][5].\n- Google CEO Sundar Pichai has warned staff that more layoffs are expected in 2024, although he mentioned that these would not be at the scale of the 12,000 job cuts in January 2023[2].\n\n## Current Layoff Environment\n- The tech industry is experiencing a significant wave of layoffs in 2024, with over 130,000 job cuts across 457 companies as of the latest reports. This trend suggests a broader industry-wide adjustment rather than an isolated event[1].\n\n## Ongoing Restructuring\n- Google has been making continuous organizational changes throughout 2023 and into 2024 to become more efficient and align resources with key product priorities. This indicates that the company may continue to make adjustments as needed[2][3][5].\n\nGiven these points, it is plausible that Google or Alphabet could announce additional layoffs before the end of 2024, especially considering the ongoing restructuring efforts and the broader industry context. However, whether TechCrunch will specifically report on these layoffs before December 31, 2024, cannot be definitively determined from the available information.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The base rate of layoffs in the tech industry, particularly at large companies like Google, is high in 2024.\n- The reference class of similar companies and their layoff activities suggests that ongoing adjustments are common.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The frequency of layoff announcements in the tech sector, especially at Google, indicates that any new layoffs could be announced at any time.\n\nIn summary, while it is likely that Google or Alphabet might announce new layoffs before the end of 2024, the question cannot be answered with absolute certainty based on the current information. The historical and current trends, however, suggest a high probability of further layoffs being reported.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Google or Alphabet included in TechCrunch's 2024 tech layoffs list for August 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no mention of Google or Alphabet being included in TechCrunch's 2024 tech layoffs list for August 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has TechCrunch updated its \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" after July 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, TechCrunch has updated its \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" after July 2024.

    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n41 days (from November 20, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nNo. If the current situation remains unchanged, with no new layoffs reported for Google or Alphabet since July 2024, TechCrunch would not report new layoffs by December 31, 2024.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 10 days remaining (a quarter of the time left), the likelihood of TechCrunch reporting new layoffs at Google or Alphabet is relatively low. Given that no new layoffs have been reported in the recent months leading up to November 20, 2024, the probability might be around **15%**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nIf there were around 160 days left until the outcome is known, the probability of new layoffs being reported would be higher due to the extended timeframe allowing for potential organizational changes. In such a scenario, the probability could increase to approximately **40%**.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nGiven the current date of November 20, 2024, there are 41 days left until the resolution date of December 31, 2024. Google has not reported new layoffs since July 2024, and the recent updates from TechCrunch do not include any new layoff announcements for Google or Alphabet in August, September, October, or November 2024. While the tech industry continues to experience layoffs, Google's recent trend does not indicate impending layoffs within the remaining timeframe. If only 10 days were left, the window for new announcements would be narrow, reducing the probability. Conversely, a longer timeframe allows more opportunities for organizational changes and subsequent reporting. Balancing these factors, a 25% probability reflects the cautious consideration of ongoing industry trends against the lack of recent specific announcements from Google.\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
