    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics grant a license for a highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 vaccine in dairy cattle before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-15\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2025, the US Department of Agriculture's [Center for Veterinary Biologics](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/veterinary-biologics) (USDA-CVB) grants or issues a full or conditional license for a vaccine against H5 [Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza) (HPAI) to be administered to dairy cattle in the United States.\n\nIf this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nAuthorized field studies do not in themselves count as licensure, nor does early access use or experimental use. \n\nIf USDA-CVB approves the vaccine for a larger group that includes dairy cattle (such as for livestock), that will count. Any approval that does not include dairy cattle will not.\n\nPlease note that, as USDA-CVB says in [NOTICE NO. 24-11](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/notice24-11.pdf), \"U.S. licensure is distinct from authorization for U.S. use.\" For purposes of this question, conditional licensure or full licensure are sufficient to resolve this question as Yes. \n\nAny vaccine for H5 strains of HPAI will count, including but not limited to H5N1, and regardless of clade, including but not limited to clade 2.3.4.4b, as long as it is associated with the current HPAI outbreak.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), HPAI has hit dairy cattle hard, with 473 [herds testing positive](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/mammals.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/mammals.htm), as of November 8, 2024. Mostly mild in cows (with most cows [reportedly](https://hoards.com/article-34969-how-will-avian-influenza-impact-milk-supply.html) being asymptomatic and most of those that get sick recovering within 3 weeks), HPAI primary affects [older cows](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(24)00112-1/fulltext), leading to decreased milk production from an industry standpoint. While mortality in cows [is low](https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/05/10/usda-hhs-announce-new-actions-reduce-impact-and-spread-h5n1), from a public health standpoint there is potentially a risk of spillover of H5N1 Influenza from cattle to humans, which might under certain circumstances lead to an epidemic. According to the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, testing from the CDC [has found](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/studies-find-little-no-immunity-h5n1-avian-flu-virus-americans) that the American population has little to no pre-existing immunity to the H5N1 virus that is circulating on farms.\n\nH5N1 has been [detected in milk](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7321e1.htm) as well as being [spread to farm workers](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/protect-farm-workers-bird-flu.html). Therefore a potential useful line of defense in protecting human public health would be an H5 vaccine for dairy cows.\n\nIn May 2023, the US Department of Agriculture's Center for Veterinary Biologics (USDA-CVB) [began testing](https://www.avma.org/news/usda-starts-highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza-vaccine-trials) vaccines for HPAI. On August 28, 2024, it [expanded](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/program-update/cvb-notice-24-13-field-studies-nonviable-non-replicating-veterinary-vaccines) to authorize field trials. The advantage of field trials is that the studies are no longer required to  be conducted in containment facilities. For further details of the field studies authorization including protocols please see [CVB Notice NO. 24-13 (pdf)](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/notice24-13.pdf)\n\nThe USDA-CVB is [accepting applications](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/sites/default/files/notice24-11.pdf) for the licensure of vaccines for livestock, including dairy cattle under the following pathways: \n\n>Conditional Licensure – CVB will consider serological response in vaccinated target species as data to support a reasonable expectation of efficacy. Serological testing should focus on antibodies to the H5 clade 2.3.4.4b hemagglutinin using an assay such as or similar to the hemagglutination inhibition assay. \n\n>Full Licensure – Currently CVB will only consider studies using vaccinationchallenge with H5 HPAI in the target species, along with all other licensure requirements, to obtain full licensure. Note the recent [Select Agent Exemption for H5 HPAI](https://www.selectagents.gov/sat/exemptions/avian-influenza.htm). Study protocols should be submitted to CVB for review.\n\nAs of 11 November 2024, one company that has begun field trials is veterinary pharmaceutical and biotechnology company Medgene Labs, which [is expecting](https://kbhbradio.com/south-dakota-company-begins-trials-on-h5n1-avian-flu-vaccine-for-dairy-cows/) to complete its H5 vaccine study in December 2024 and share its results with the USDA at that time.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) will grant a license for a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 vaccine in dairy cattle before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Status of Licensing\nAs of the latest notices, the USDA has not yet authorized the use of H5 vaccines in the United States. Any products that are licensed will carry a restriction prohibiting U.S. sale, distribution, and use until further notice[3][4].\n\n## Regulatory Process\nThe CVB has issued several notices (CVB Notice 24-06, 24-09, 24-11, and 24-13) to guide the development and licensure of HPAI vaccines. These notices outline the requirements for field studies, efficacy evaluation, and the submission of proposals for vaccine licensure. The process involves comprehensive testing, including milk and serum testing, and the evaluation of adverse events[1][3][4].\n\n## Funding and Support\nThe USDA has committed significant funds ($33.65 million from HPAI Commodity Credit Corporation and up to $10 million through APHIS and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture) to support vaccine research and development. This indicates a strong commitment to finding a solution, but it does not guarantee a timeline for licensure[1][4].\n\n## Timeframe for Licensure\nGiven the complexity of the regulatory process, the need for comprehensive field studies, and the current restrictions on vaccine use, it is uncertain whether a license will be granted before January 1, 2025. The situation is described as \"rapidly evolving,\" and the CVB is still in the process of evaluating proposals and conducting necessary studies[1][3][4].\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the available information, it is not clear whether the CVB will grant a license for an HPAI H5 vaccine in dairy cattle before January 1, 2025. The process is ongoing, and several steps, including field studies and regulatory approvals, need to be completed before any licensure can occur. Therefore, the answer to this question cannot be definitively determined as yes or no at this time.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Medgene Labs completed its field trials for an H5 vaccine in dairy cattle and shared results with the USDA?\nANSWER: No, Medgene Labs has not yet completed its field trials for the H5N1 vaccine in dairy cattle and shared the results with the USDA. The field trial began in October 2024 and is expected to be complete in five weeks, with the results to be shared with the USDA thereafter[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have other countries approved H5 vaccines for use in dairy cattle?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of other countries approving H5 vaccines specifically for use in dairy cattle. The sources discuss various aspects of the HPAI H5N1 outbreak, including human and poultry cases, but they do not provide information on vaccine approvals for dairy cattle in other countries.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any companies submitted applications to the USDA-CVB for licensure of an H5 vaccine for dairy cattle?\nANSWER: YES\n\nSeveral sources indicate that companies have submitted or expressed interest in submitting applications for licensure of H5 vaccines for dairy cattle. For example, Medgene, a South Dakota-based animal health vaccine manufacturer, has been authorized to conduct field safety trials for their H5N1 vaccine in dairy cattle, which is part of the licensure process[3][4][5]. Additionally, the USDA has authorized the acceptance of licensure applications for such vaccines under specific conditions[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics previously granted a license for an H5 vaccine in dairy cattle?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) has authorized the start of an initial field study for a nonviable, non-replicating H5N1 vaccine in dairy cattle, but they have not yet granted a license for such a vaccine. The field trials are a part of the vaccine licensure process, and the vaccine still needs to be proven safe and effective before it can be licensed[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do any existing H5 vaccines for poultry show efficacy in dairy cattle?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not offer specific information on the efficacy of existing H5 vaccines for poultry in dairy cattle.\n\n- The sources discuss the detection, transmission, and public health implications of H5N1 avian influenza in dairy cattle, but they do not mention the use or efficacy of H5 vaccines in dairy cattle[2][3][4].\n- There is a mention of the potential development of an effective vaccine for H5N1 in bovine, but it does not indicate that any existing vaccines have been tested or proven effective in dairy cattle[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the USDA-CVB granted any conditional licenses for H5 vaccines in livestock since the current HPAI outbreak began?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) has not yet granted any conditional or full licenses for the use of H5 vaccines in livestock in the United States. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- CVB Notice 24-11 and 24-13 indicate that while the CVB is accepting license applications and considering various criteria for licensure, including conditional licensure, no licenses have been granted for the use of these vaccines in the U.S. as of the notice dates[2][3][5].\n- The notices explicitly state that any products licensed will carry a restriction prohibiting U.S. sale, distribution, and use until further notice[2][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been confirmed cases of H5N1 avian influenza transmitting from dairy cattle to humans in the United States?\nANSWER: YES, there have been confirmed cases of H5N1 avian influenza transmitting from dairy cattle to humans in the United States.\n\n- As of April 1, 2024, a dairy farm worker in Texas tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus after exposure to presumably infected dairy cattle[1].\n- A second case was reported in Michigan on May 22, 2024, involving a dairy farm worker who was exposed to infected cattle[1].\n- Additionally, between May and July 2024, 13 confirmed H5N1 infections occurred in humans, all directly linked to dairy farms and poultry[2].\n- The CDC and other health agencies have confirmed that these human cases were due to direct exposure to infected animals, with no indication of person-to-person transmission[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the USDA announced plans to expedite the licensure process for H5 vaccines in dairy cattle?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe USDA has announced plans and taken steps to expedite the licensure process for H5N1 vaccines in dairy cattle. Here are some key points:\n\n- The USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) is currently accepting license applications for vaccines to protect livestock against H5 HPAI, and they are considering conditional licensure based on specific study data[3][4][5].\n- The CVB Notice allows for vaccine studies to be conducted outside of containment facilities, which has the potential to accelerate agency licensure of H5N1 vaccines in dairy cows[2][5].\n- The USDA has authorized the start of initial field studies under specific conditions to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nonviable, non-replicating vaccines, which is a significant step in the expedited licensure process[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the prevalence of H5N1 in dairy cattle increased significantly in recent months?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the prevalence of H5N1 in dairy cattle has been monitored and reported over several months, but there is evidence to suggest that the incidence rate of new cases may be slowing down rather than increasing significantly.\n\n- As of September 9, 2024, it was reported that the incidence rate of new HPAI cases in U.S. dairy herds seems to be slowing, with 6 new cases reported over the past 30 days[2].\n- The number of confirmed cases has been increasing, but the rate of new detections appears to be decreasing. For example, there were 20 confirmed cases in the last 30 days as of August 26, 2024, and 44 confirmed cases in the last 30 days as of October 2, 2024, but this does not necessarily indicate a significant increase in the prevalence rate[2].\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that while the total number of cases has increased, the rate of new detections may not be significantly increasing in recent months.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the USDA-CVB updated its guidelines to make it easier to obtain licensure for H5 vaccines in dairy cattle?\nANSWER: The USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) has made several updates and provisions to facilitate the licensure process for H5 vaccines in dairy cattle, although these updates do not necessarily make the process easier in a simplistic sense, but rather more structured and supportive.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- The CVB has issued several notices (e.g., Notice 24-13, Notice 24-11) that provide updates and guidelines for the licensure of veterinary biologics products, including vaccines for HPAI H5N1 in dairy cattle. These notices outline specific requirements for field studies, efficacy and safety evaluations, and the submission of study protocols[1][5][4].\n- The CVB is accepting license applications for vaccines and is considering conditional licensure based on field efficacy and safety study data, which suggests a more flexible approach to licensure[1][5].\n- The USDA has authorized the acceptance of licensure applications for initial field studies of nonviable, non-replicating vaccines against HPAI-H5 in dairy cattle, indicating a step towards potential licensure[3].\n- The CVB has also provided guidance on the necessary testing, including serological response and challenge studies, to support licensure applications[1][5].\n\nWhile these updates do not simplify the process, they do provide clearer guidelines and support for vaccine manufacturers, which can be seen as making the licensure process more manageable and structured. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYES",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nThere are **46 days** remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf nothing changes, the outcome would be **No**, as no license has been granted yet.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately **12 days** left, I would forecast a **10% probability** that the license would be granted in time.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith about **184 days** remaining, I would forecast a **40% probability** of licensure before the deadline.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSeveral factors influence the probability that the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) will grant a license for an H5 vaccine in dairy cattle before January 1, 2025.\n\n1. **Current Status and Timeline:**\n   - **Medgene Labs Field Trials:** Medgene Labs began field trials for their H5N1 vaccine in October 2024, expecting to complete them in December 2024 and share results with the USDA thereafter. This leaves a narrow window for the USDA to review the data and grant licensure before January 1, 2025.\n   - **Regulatory Process Duration:** Even under expedited conditions, the USDA-CVB's review and approval process typically takes weeks to months. The time left may not be sufficient for a thorough evaluation and decision-making process.\n\n2. **USDA's Efforts to Expedite Licensure:**\n   - The USDA-CVB has updated guidelines to facilitate the licensure process, including accepting conditional licensure applications based on serological responses.\n   - Field studies are now permitted outside containment facilities, potentially accelerating data collection and review.\n\n3. **Public Health Concerns:**\n   - **Human Cases:** There have been confirmed cases of H5N1 transmission from dairy cattle to humans in the U.S., heightening public health concerns.\n   - **Risk of Spillover:** The detection of H5N1 in milk and its spread to farm workers underscore the urgency for preventive measures, such as vaccination of dairy cattle.\n\n4. **Likelihood of Rapid Approval:**\n   - While the USDA has mechanisms for emergency or conditional licensure, granting a license within days to weeks after receiving trial data is ambitious.\n   - If the field trial results are exceptionally positive and there is significant pressure due to public health risks, the USDA might expedite approval.\n\n5. **Base Rates and Historical Precedents:**\n   - Historically, vaccine licensure, even under expedited review, rarely occurs in such a short timeframe.\n   - The absence of prior licensure for an H5 vaccine in dairy cattle suggests additional caution may be exercised.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the tight timeline, the recent commencement of field trials, and the USDA's regulatory procedures, it is **unlikely but not impossible** that a license will be granted before January 1, 2025. The expedited efforts and public health concerns slightly increase the probability, but substantial hurdles remain.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
