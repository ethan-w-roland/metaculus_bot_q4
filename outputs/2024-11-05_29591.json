    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the CDC report more than 80% of the tested influenza sequences as influenza A during the 2024-25 season through the week ending Dec 21, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves based on the cumulative percentage of Influenza A sequences since September 29, 2024, of all specimens that have tested positive for influenza in clinical laboratories in the United States nationwide, as reported by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Resolution will be based on the CDCâ€™s first [FluView](https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/index.html) Weekly US Influenza Surveillance Report published that encompasses the entirety of the time period from September 29, 2024, through the week ending Dec 21, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nSpecifically, this question resolves based on the percentage of positive specimens reported by CDC for Clinical Laboratories. For example, in the FluView report for [Week 18 of 2024, ending May 4, 2024](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/weeklyarchives2023-2024/week18.htm), CDC reported 69.1% of positive specimens as Influenza A, which would have been the resolution number. In the event CDC reports only the raw numbers, the calculation will be the number of positive specimens of Type A divided by the number of positive specimens, multiplied by 100% and then rounded to the nearest tenth. In this example, this is 235,659 divided by 340,899, which rounds to 69.1%.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nInfluenza pandemics typically [come from](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2928832/) Influenza A, particularly from a sub-type against which much of the human population lacks much immunity. According [to CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses-types.html):\n\n>Currently circulating influenza A(H1N1) viruses are related to the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus that emerged in the spring of 2009 and caused a flu pandemic ([CDC 2009 H1N1 Flu website](http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/)). These viruses, scientifically called the \"A(H1N1)pdm09 virus,\" and more generally called \"2009 H1N1,\" have continued to circulate seasonally since then and have undergone genetic changes and changes to their [antigenic properties](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/professionals/antigenic.htm) (i.e., the properties of the virus that affect immunity).\n\n>Influenza A(H3N2) viruses also change both genetically and antigenically. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses have formed many separate, genetically different clades in recent years that continue to co-circulate.\n\nFor the 2024-25 flu season, the [trivalent](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/trivalent-vaccines-2024-2025.html) (three-component) vaccine will target two influenza A and one influenza B virus. During the 2023-24 season, 69.2% of positive specimens [were](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/flu-summary-2023-2024.html) influenza A, substantially similar to the 69.1% for the week ended ending May 4, 2024, at which time 97% of all positive cases that would be registered for the season had been tested. Among the 25,390 influenza-associated hospitalizations for the season, a disproportionate number (84.6%) were associated with influenza A, as compared with with 14.8% associated with influenza B.\n\nAccording [to CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/overview/index.html):\n\n>All public health and clinical laboratories report each week to CDC the total number of respiratory specimens tested for influenza and the number positive for influenza viruses, along with age or age group of the person, if available. CDC presents data from clinical laboratories that include the weekly total number of specimens tested for influenza, the number of positive influenza tests, and the percent positive by influenza virus type.\n\n>Influenza surveillance data are aggregated according to the week the event (e.g., positive laboratory test, outpatient visit, death) occurred. The week starts on Sunday and ends on the following Saturday. Each surveillance participant is requested to report its data to CDC by Tuesday afternoon of the following week. The data are then downloaded, compiled, and analyzed at CDC. [FluView](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/) and [FluView Interactive](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluviewinteractive.htm) are updated weekly on Fridays. \n\nSince the pandemic, the numbers have been as follows:\n\n### FluView Week 18 (beginning of May) - Influenza A %\n\n| Season     | Influenza A % |\n|------------|---------------|\n| 2023-24    | 69.1%         |\n| 2022-23    | 98.2%         |\n| 2021-22    | 98.4%         |\n\nLooking at a wider sweep of history, during the 25 years through the 2023-24 season, 11 had two waves of influenza activity. Among those 11 seasons, 8 of them [had](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/flu-summary-2023-2024.html) their second wave come from influenza B.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the CDC reporting more than 80% of the tested influenza sequences as influenza A during the 2024-2025 season through the week ending December 21, 2024, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Historical Data\nDuring the 2023-2024 influenza season, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was the predominant virus circulating, especially from early November 2023 through the end of February 2024. However, as the season progressed, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B/Victoria viruses also co-circulated and became more prevalent as overall influenza activity decreased.\n\n## Current Season Projections\nThe CDC's projections for the 2024-2025 season do not specify the exact proportion of influenza A versus other types, but they do indicate that the vaccine composition for the 2024-2025 season includes influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) components, reflecting the expectation that these viruses will continue to circulate.\n\n## Surveillance Activities\nThe CDC is conducting extensive surveillance, including subtyping and whole genome sequencing of influenza specimens. This surveillance will help in identifying the predominant viruses circulating during the season. However, the specific percentage of influenza A sequences is not pre-determined and will depend on the actual viral activity observed during the season.\n\n## Uncertainty\nGiven the inherent uncertainty in predicting the exact distribution of influenza viruses, it is challenging to definitively state whether more than 80% of the tested sequences will be influenza A. The CDC's assessments are based on historical data, expert opinion, and scenario modeling, but the actual outcome can vary based on several factors, including the emergence of new variants and changes in population immunity.\n\nIn conclusion, while historical data suggests that influenza A has been predominant in recent seasons, the specific percentage for the 2024-2025 season cannot be predicted with certainty. Therefore, the question cannot be clearly answered as yes or no based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current CDC surveillance data indicating that over 80% of positive influenza specimens are Influenza A as of November 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nAs of the reports for Week 40 and Week 43 in November 2024, the CDC surveillance data indicate that over 80% of the positive influenza specimens are Influenza A.\n\n- For Week 40, 333 out of 380 positive specimens (87.6%) were Influenza A.\n- For Week 43, 523 out of 594 positive specimens (88.0%) were Influenza A.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are public health experts predicting that over 80% of influenza cases will be Influenza A through December 21, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific prediction from public health experts regarding the exact percentage of influenza cases that will be Influenza A through December 21, 2024.\n\nThe sources do provide information on the current distribution of influenza types, such as the dominance of Influenza A viruses in recent weeks, but they do not make a specific prediction for the percentage of Influenza A cases through December 21, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any new Influenza B strains emerged recently that could lead to a surge in Influenza B cases?\nANSWER: No, there is no indication of new Influenza B strains emerging recently that could lead to a surge in Influenza B cases. Here are the key points:\n\n- Influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses have not been identified globally since March 2020, and this lineage is considered to be extinct due to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures.\n- All recent influenza B viruses characterized belong to the B/Victoria lineage, specifically the V1A.3a.2 clade, with no new strains reported.\n\nTherefore, there is no evidence of new Influenza B strains emerging that could lead to a surge in cases.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any reports of increased Influenza B activity in the early part of the 2024-25 influenza season?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of increased Influenza B activity in the early part of the 2024-2025 influenza season.\n\n- The CDC report for the 2024-2025 season up to week 41 (ending October 12, 2024) indicates that seasonal influenza activity is low nationally, and all reported viruses during Week 40 were influenza A, with no mention of increased Influenza B activity.\n- The other sources discuss the composition of the 2024-2025 influenza vaccines and the absence of B/Yamagata lineage viruses, but they do not provide specific data on early season activity for the 2024-2025 season.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Influenza A currently the predominant influenza type circulating in the United States for the 2024-25 season?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, as of the current reporting period for the 2024-2025 season, Influenza A is indeed one of the predominant types circulating in the United States, but it is not the only one.\n\n- The CDC report for Week 40 of the 2024-2025 season indicates that Influenza A viruses, specifically A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), are co-circulating.\n- There is no indication that Influenza A is the sole predominant type, as both subtypes of Influenza A are mentioned along with the presence of other viruses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**, Influenza A is currently one of the predominant types circulating, but it co-circulates with other subtypes.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the CDC reported more than 80% of positive influenza specimens as Influenza A in previous seasons through the week ending December 21?\nANSWER: Yes, the CDC has reported more than 80% of positive influenza specimens as Influenza A in previous seasons through the week ending December 21.\n\nFor example, during the 2023-2024 influenza season, the CDC reported that for the week ending December 23, 2023 (Week 51), 85.5% of the positive specimens were influenza A.\n\nAdditionally, the cumulative data for the 2023-2024 season up to various points also showed that the majority of positive specimens were influenza A, often exceeding 80%.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the 2024-25 influenza vaccine more effective against Influenza A than Influenza B?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the effectiveness of the 2024-25 influenza vaccine against different influenza types and subtypes can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- The adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) against influenza A subtypes was reported as 36.5% against A(H3N2) and 37.1% against A(H1N1)pdm09.\n- For influenza B, the specific VE estimates for the 2024-25 season are not provided in the sources. However, it is mentioned that the vaccines for the 2024-25 season will not include the influenza B/Yamagata component, and the focus is on the B/Victoria lineage.\n\nSince the sources do not provide direct comparisons or specific VE estimates for influenza B in the 2024-25 season, it is unclear whether the vaccine is more effective against Influenza A than Influenza B based on the available information.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are global influenza trends for 2024 showing a higher prevalence of Influenza A over Influenza B?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the global influenza trends for 2024 do indeed show a higher prevalence of Influenza A over Influenza B.\n\n- The World Health Organization (WHO) report indicates that during the period from 11 to 24 December 2023, 86.6% of the influenza viruses detected were typed as influenza A, while 13.4% were typed as influenza B.\n\n- The CDC report for the 2023-2024 season in the United States also shows that influenza A viruses, particularly A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), were predominant, with 69.2% of positive specimens being influenza A and 30.8% being influenza B.\n\n- The CDC's update on the Southern Hemisphere flu season for 2024 similarly notes that influenza A viruses, including A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2), were the predominant types detected.\n\nThese reports collectively indicate a higher prevalence of Influenza A over Influenza B in global influenza trends for 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Historically, have seasons starting with a high prevalence of Influenza A maintained that dominance through late December?\nANSWER: Historically, the dominance of a particular influenza virus type or subtype can vary throughout the flu season, and it is not guaranteed that a season starting with a high prevalence of Influenza A will maintain that dominance through late December.\n\nFor example, the 2021-22 influenza season in the United States started with a first wave of Influenza A(H3N2) activity peaking in mid-December, but the season also saw a second wave with peaks ranging from mid-March to May, still dominated by Influenza A(H3N2).\n\nIn another instance, the 2023-2024 season began with increasing activity in early November and peaked in late December with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 as the predominant virus, and this dominance continued through the season.\n\nHowever, the flu season can be complex, with multiple waves and potential shifts in the predominant virus types or subtypes over time. Therefore, while it is possible for Influenza A to maintain dominance through late December, it is not a universal rule.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the proportion of Influenza A to total positive influenza specimens been increasing compared to previous seasons?\nANSWER: To determine if the proportion of Influenza A to total positive influenza specimens has been increasing compared to previous seasons, we need to analyze the data from the current and previous seasons.\n\n### Current Season (2023-2024 and early 2024-2025)\n- During the 2023-2024 season, influenza A viruses were predominant, with 69.2% of the positive specimens being influenza A and 30.8% being influenza B.\n- In the current reporting period for the 2024-2025 season, influenza A still dominates, with 88.0% to 94.8% of the positive specimens being influenza A.\n\n### Previous Seasons\n- The specific proportions for previous seasons are not detailed in the provided sources, but we can infer from the current data that influenza A has been a significant component of the flu seasons.\n\n### Comparison\n- The data indicates that influenza A has consistently been the predominant type of influenza virus in both the 2023-2024 and the early part of the 2024-2025 seasons. However, without explicit comparative data from previous seasons, it is difficult to definitively state whether the proportion of Influenza A has increased.\n\nGiven the information available, we cannot conclusively determine if the proportion of Influenza A to total positive influenza specimens has been increasing compared to previous seasons.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately **6 weeks** remain until December 21, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf current trends persist, with over 80% of positive influenza specimens reported as Influenza A, the CDC would report more than 80% of the tested influenza sequences as Influenza A through December 21, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith roughly **1.5 weeks** remaining, the probability would be higher that Influenza A remains dominant, as there would be minimal time for significant changes in circulating virus types.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\nWith approximately **24 weeks** remaining, the probability would decrease due to increased uncertainty and the potential for shifts in dominant influenza strains over a longer period.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Data:** As of the latest CDC reports for Weeks 40 to 43 in 2024, Influenza A accounts for approximately 88% of positive influenza specimens. This indicates a strong dominance of Influenza A in the early part of the 2024-25 season.\n\n- **Historical Trends:** In recent seasons, Influenza A has often been the predominant type through December. For instance, in the 2023-24 season, Influenza A comprised over 80% of positive specimens through late December.\n\n- **Influenza B Activity:** There are no current reports of increased Influenza B activity or emerging strains that could significantly alter the current trend. Influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses have not been detected since March 2020, and no new Influenza B variants have been reported.\n\n- **Global Trends:** Global surveillance aligns with U.S. data, showing a higher prevalence of Influenza A over Influenza B in 2024.\n\n- **Time Remaining:** With only six weeks left until December 21, there is limited time for a substantial shift in the circulating influenza virus types. Significant changes in dominance are less likely during this period.\n\n- **Vaccine Composition:** The 2024-25 influenza vaccine targets two Influenza A strains and one Influenza B strain, reflecting expectations of Influenza A dominance.\n\n- **Uncertainties:** While unexpected shifts can occur, such as a sudden rise in Influenza B cases, current evidence does not suggest this is imminent.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 90%**",
