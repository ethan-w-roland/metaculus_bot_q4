{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill RCP's polling bias for Trump based on national polls in the month before the 2024 election be greater than 1.0 percentage points?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThe question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump's national polling bias when using the October 17 [RealClear Polling (RCP) average](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris) of a -1.583 percentage point spread (Trump) is strictly greater than 1.0 pp. \n\nThis will be calculated as -1.583 percentage points (pp), minus Trump's popular vote percentage (expressed in pp), plus Harris' popular vote percentage (in pp).\n\nBACKGROUND:\nPolling bias is calculated by subtracting the actual voting percentage spread from the pre-election polled percentage spread of the candidate in question. For example, [Activote's](https://www.activote.net/polling-analysis/) national 2020 poll reported Trump trailing Biden by a 6 percentage point spread. The actual election resulted in 51.31% votes for Biden and 46.85% for Trump, a -4.46pp spread. Trump's polling bias was then \\(-6pp-(-4.46pp) = -1.54pp \\).\n\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/) estimated a polling bias of +4.1pp for the Biden in 2020 and +3.3pp for Clinton in 2016. However, it found almost no weighted-average polling bias in the 2022 midterm election. The \"shy Trump voter hypothesis\" suggests one possible reason for the bias in 2016 and 2020 is that Trump voters were reluctant to respond or respond accurately to the polls. Authors from [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/11/02/shy-trump-voters-myth/), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/1/21544644/shy-trump-voters-polling-error-explained), and others have questioned this hypothesis.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the RealClearPolitics (RCP) polling bias for Donald Trump based on national polls in the month before the 2024 election will be greater than 1.0 percentage points, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context\nIn the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, polls consistently underestimated Trump's support. In 2016, national polls were off by about 1.1 points in Trump's favor, and in key swing states like Wisconsin, the underestimation was more significant, up to 7 points.\nIn 2020, national polls still underestimated Trump's support, though to a lesser extent, by about 3 points.\n\n## Current Polling Challenges\nPollsters face ongoing challenges such as nonresponse bias, particularly among Trump supporters who may be skeptical of polls and less likely to participate. This bias could lead to an underestimation of Trump's support.\nAdditionally, the composition of the electorate, especially in states like Wisconsin and North Carolina, can complicate accurate polling due to the lack of partisan data in voter files and the difficulty in reaching certain demographics.\n\n## Possible Scenarios\nThere are several scenarios to consider:\n- **Trump Outperforming Polls**: Given historical trends, it is possible that Trump could outperform the polls again, potentially by more than 1 point, especially if the same biases that affected previous elections persist.\n- **No Significant Bias**: Another possibility is that pollsters have learned from past mistakes and will not exhibit a significant bias in either direction. This would mean the polling bias could be minimal or within the margin of error.\n- **Overcompensation**: There is also a chance that pollsters might overcompensate for their previous anti-Trump biases, leading to an overestimation of Trump's support, although this is less likely given the historical context.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\nThe base rate of polling bias against Trump in previous elections suggests a higher likelihood of underestimation. However, the variability in polling performance across different elections (e.g., the 2022 midterms) introduces uncertainty.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the historical trends and ongoing challenges in polling, it is plausible that the RCP polling bias for Trump could be greater than 1.0 percentage points. However, the exact magnitude and direction of this bias remain uncertain due to the complexities and variability in polling methodologies and voter behavior.\n\nThis question cannot be answered with a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" based on the available information, as it depends on various factors that are still evolving and subject to multiple interpretations.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump officially the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election as of October 2023?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nAs of October 2023, Donald Trump had not yet been officially nominated as the Republican nominee for the 2024 presidential election. Although he had crossed the delegate threshold necessary to become the presumptive nominee on March 12, 2024, the official nomination occurred at the Republican National Convention on July 15, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the polling errors in the 2022 midterm elections show minimal bias compared to previous elections?\nANSWER: The polling errors in the 2022 midterm elections did indeed show minimal bias compared to previous elections.\n\n- The 2022 midterms saw historically accurate polling, with a weighted-average bias of just D+0.8, which is significantly lower than the biases observed in the 2016 and 2020 cycles.\n- This reduced bias is highlighted by the fact that generic-ballot polls, which were common in the 2022 cycle, had a weighted-average bias of D+1.9, but overall, the bias was much less pronounced than in previous presidential election cycles.\n- Additionally, the polling accuracy in the 2022 midterms was noted for its low error rates, particularly in House races, which further supports the notion of minimal bias.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are recent polls up to October 2023 indicating reduced bias in estimating support for Republican candidates?\nANSWER: The information provided from the sources does not specifically address the issue of reduced bias in estimating support for Republican candidates in recent polls up to October 2023.\n\nThe sources discuss various aspects of the 2024 Republican primary, such as candidate support, voter demographics, and favorability ratings, but they do not analyze or comment on the bias or accuracy of the polling methods themselves.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer to whether recent polls up to October 2023 indicate reduced bias in estimating support for Republican candidates is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the RealClearPolitics national polling average in the month before the 2020 election underestimate Donald Trump's vote share by more than 1.0 percentage points?\nANSWER: To determine if the RealClearPolitics national polling average in the month before the 2020 election underestimated Donald Trump's vote share by more than 1.0 percentage points, we need to compare the polling averages with the actual election results.\n\n### Polling Averages\nThe RealClearPolitics average for the final days leading up to the 2020 election showed Joe Biden leading Donald Trump. For example, the RCP Average on November 3rd had Biden at 51.1% and Trump at 43.6%.\n\n### Actual Election Results\nIn the actual 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden received 51.3% of the vote, and Donald Trump received 46.9% of the vote.\n\n### Comparison\nThe RCP Average had Trump at 43.6%, while he actually received 46.9% of the vote. This means the polling average underestimated Trump's vote share by approximately 3.3 percentage points (46.9% - 43.6%).\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did RealClearPolitics accurately predict election outcomes in the 2022 midterm elections?\nANSWER: The accuracy of RealClearPolitics' (RCP) predictions for the 2022 midterm elections can be evaluated from several aspects, but the available sources do not provide a comprehensive assessment of RCP's overall predictive accuracy.\n\nHere are some points to consider:\n\n- **Generic Congressional Vote**: RCP's average polling data for the generic congressional vote showed a spread that was close to the final results, with Republicans leading by 2.5% in the RCP average, compared to the actual 2.8% margin.\n  \n- **Senate and House Forecasts**: While RCP provided maps and projections for Senate and House races, the sources do not detail how accurately these projections matched the final outcomes. They do show changes in race statuses and projections, but do not provide a final evaluation of their accuracy.\n\nGiven the information available, it is unclear whether RCP's predictions were entirely accurate across all races and forecasts. The sources indicate that their polling averages were close to the final results in some respects, but a comprehensive evaluation of their predictive accuracy is not provided.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the RealClearPolitics national polling average in the month before the 2016 election underestimate Donald Trump's vote share by more than 1.0 percentage points?\nANSWER: To determine if the RealClearPolitics national polling average in the month before the 2016 election underestimated Donald Trump's vote share by more than 1.0 percentage points, we need to compare the final polling averages with the actual election results.\n\n## Final Polling Averages:\nAccording to the RealClearPolitics average from November 1 to November 7, 2016, Donald Trump's average polling percentage was around 43.6%.\n\n## Actual Election Results:\nIn the actual 2016 presidential election, Donald Trump received 46.1% of the vote.\n\n## Comparison:\nThe difference between Trump's actual vote share (46.1%) and the polling average (43.6%) is 2.5 percentage points.\n\nSince 2.5 percentage points is more than 1.0 percentage point, the RealClearPolitics national polling average did indeed underestimate Donald Trump's vote share by more than 1.0 percentage point.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence that nonresponse bias affected polling accuracy in the 2016 and 2020 elections?\nANSWER: Yes, there is evidence suggesting that nonresponse bias could have affected polling accuracy in the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n\n1. **Nonresponse Among Republicans**: Studies indicate that some Republican-leaning voters, particularly those who support Trump, were less likely to participate in surveys. For example, the FiveThirtyEight analysis found that certain Trump-leaning voters had lower response rates over time, which could lead to an underestimation of GOP support.\n\n2. **Participation Rates**: Pew Research Center's analysis showed that the share of new recruits to their American Trends Panel identifying as Republican or leaning Republican decreased over time, which could reflect either real-world changes in party affiliation or methodological issues in recruitment. This trend suggests potential underrepresentation of Republicans in polls.\n\n3. **Weighting Adjustments**: The need for weighting adjustments to correct for the underrepresentation of certain groups, including Republicans, is another indicator of nonresponse bias. Weighting for vote preference and other political characteristics has become more widespread to address these gaps, but it also highlights the initial skew in the data.\n\n4. **Expert Opinions**: Experts, such as Scott Keeter from the Pew Research Center and Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini, have noted that nonresponse bias, particularly among Trump supporters and certain demographic groups like rural and white, non-college-educated individuals, could have impacted polling accuracy.\n\nThese points collectively suggest that nonresponse bias was a factor that could have influenced the accuracy of polling in the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the \"shy Trump voter\" hypothesis been widely discredited by polling experts?\nANSWER: The \"shy Trump voter\" hypothesis has been subject to significant scrutiny and skepticism by polling experts, and there is substantial evidence to suggest that it has been widely discredited.\n\n- Several studies and reports, including those from the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), have downplayed the significance of the \"shy Trump voter\" hypothesis as a major source of polling bias.\n- Experiments and analyses, such as those by Alexander Coppock and others, have found little evidence to support the idea that Trump supporters were more likely to hide their support than supporters of other candidates.\n- The general consensus in the polling community is that the \"shy Trump voter\" effect is likely a myth or, at the very least, not a significant factor in polling errors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there substantial differences between RealClearPolitics polling averages and those of other major aggregators?\nANSWER: Yes, there are substantial differences and criticisms regarding the methodology and accuracy of RealClearPolitics (RCP) polling averages compared to other major aggregators.\n\n## Methodological Differences\n- RCP calculates its averages by taking a simple moving average of polls conducted over the last few weeks, but this method has been criticized for not accounting for poll quality, sample size, or house effects, which other aggregators like FiveThirtyEight and Split Ticket do.\n- RCP's approach to adjusting for bias by using historical data from past election cycles has been heavily criticized for lacking predictive value and potentially introducing more bias and noise into their averages.\n\n## Accuracy and Bias\n- Studies have shown that RCP's adjustments often result in more biased polling averages than if they had used raw averages. For example, in 7 of the last 10 election cycles, RCP's adjusted averages would have been less accurate than the raw averages.\n- There are concerns about RCP's methodology being opaque and potentially biased towards conservative or Republican outcomes, as evidenced by their projections in the 2022 elections which were off by significant margins.\n- Comparisons with other aggregators, such as FiveThirtyEight and The Upshot at The New York Times, have shown that RCP's performance is not consistently better and sometimes worse, especially in handling undecided voters and state-level forecasts.\n\n## User and Analyst Opinions\n- Users and analysts have expressed mixed opinions about RCP, with some criticizing its rightward lean and cherry-picking of polls, while others still find it useful as an aggregator despite these issues.\n\nIn summary, the differences in methodology, accuracy, and perceived bias highlight substantial distinctions between RCP's polling averages and those of other major aggregators.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major polling organizations made significant methodological changes since the 2020 election to address polling biases?\nANSWER: Yes, major polling organizations have made significant methodological changes since the 2020 election to address polling biases.\n\nSeveral sources highlight these changes:\n- After the 2020 election, pollsters made more design changes than they did after the 2016 election. More than a third of pollsters changed how they sample people, how they interview them, or both, between 2020 and 2022.\n- Pollsters have adopted multiple methods, including text messaging, probability-based panels, and a mix of online, phone, and other approaches to improve accuracy. The use of multiple methods has increased, with 17% of national pollsters using at least three different methods in 2022, up from 5% in 2020.\n- There has been a focus on improving response rates, particularly among Republican or conservative voters, by using methods such as physical, paper-based approaches like postcards for recruitment and poll completion.\n- Pollsters are also weighting their sample data differently, such as accounting for respondents' past votes to better ensure that the political makeup of survey samples matches reality.\n- The Pew Research Center and other organizations have noted that pollsters have become more transparent about their methodologies and have made adjustments to account for various biases, including education levels and voter turnout.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nApproximately **3 weeks**. The U.S. presidential election is on **November 5, 2024**, and the official popular vote results are typically available within a week after the election.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, with the current RCP average (as of October 17) showing Donald Trump trailing by **1.583 percentage points**, and assuming that polling errors mirror those of previous presidential elections, it's likely that the actual polling bias would be **greater than 1.0 percentage points**. Historical trends suggest that Trump has outperformed polls by more than 1 percentage point in past elections, so the question would resolve as **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only about **0.75 weeks** (approximately **5 days**) left until the election, I would forecast a slightly lower probability that the polling bias exceeds 1.0 percentage points, perhaps around **55%**, due to increased confidence in the polls' accuracy closer to the election and less time for unforeseen events to impact voter behavior.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was four times the time left:**\n\nIf there were **12 weeks** remaining until the election, the increased uncertainty and potential for significant events to influence voter sentiment would lead me to forecast a higher probability, around **70%**, that the polling bias exceeds 1.0 percentage points.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**Historical Context:**\n\n- **2016 Election:** The RealClearPolitics (RCP) national polling average underestimated Trump's vote share by approximately **2.5 percentage points**. Polls showed Trump at 43.6%, but he received 46.1% of the vote.\n  \n- **2020 Election:** Similarly, the RCP national polling average underestimated Trump's vote share by about **3.3 percentage points**. Polls had Trump at 43.6%, but he achieved 46.9% in the actual vote.\n\nThese trends indicate that in both previous presidential elections involving Trump, polls underestimated his support by more than **1.0 percentage point**.\n\n**Recent Polling Improvements:**\n\n- **2022 Midterms:** Polling errors showed minimal bias, with a weighted-average bias of just **D+0.8**, significantly lower than in the 2016 and 2020 elections. This suggests improvements in polling methodologies.\n  \n- **Methodological Changes:** Pollsters have made significant adjustments since 2020, including:\n  - Diversifying sampling methods to reduce nonresponse bias.\n  - Weighting samples differently to better match the electorate.\n  - Increasing transparency and adjusting for education levels and voter turnout.\n\n**Nonresponse Bias and \"Shy Trump Voters\":**\n\n- **Nonresponse Bias:** There is evidence that nonresponse bias affected polling accuracy in 2016 and 2020, with certain demographics less likely to participate in polls.\n  \n- **Discrediting \"Shy Trump Voter\" Hypothesis:** The hypothesis has been largely discredited by polling experts, indicating that other factors might have contributed to past polling errors.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n- The current RCP average shows Trump trailing by **1.583 percentage points**.\n  \n- Given the historical underestimation of Trump's support and the specific dynamics of presidential elections, there is a plausible chance that the polling bias could exceed **1.0 percentage point**.\n  \n- However, improvements in polling methodologies and the accuracy observed in the 2022 midterms suggest that the bias might be less pronounced this time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBalancing these factors, while historical trends point towards a polling bias greater than **1.0 percentage point**, methodological improvements and recent polling accuracy reduce the likelihood compared to previous elections.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 60%**", "probability": 60}
