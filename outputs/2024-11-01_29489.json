    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the US State Department approve more than 15 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves based on the total number of arms sales approvals by the US State Department listed at the Major Arms Sales [notifications page](https://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/archive-date/202410) by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency for October 2024, November 2024, and December 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on January 1, 2025.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNote that some State Department arms approvals are subject to congressional approval; however, this question only asks about arms sales listed at the resolution source as being approved by the State Department, even if later rejected by Congress.\n\nEvery listing will count as only one event, regardless of the number of types of equipment listed.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe United States is the largest arms exporter in the world, [accounting for](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/fs_2403_at_2023.pdf) 42% of global arms exports, with France and Russia tied for a distant 2nd, at 11%, and China in 4th place at 6%. In the past 5 years, State Department-approved arms sales per month have been as follows:\n\n| Month           | Number |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| October 2024    | 9      |\n| September 2024  | 12     |\n| August 2024     | 22     |\n| July 2024       | 4      |\n| June 2024       | 7      |\n| May 2024        | 10     |\n| April 2024      | 7      |\n| March 2024      | 10     |\n| February 2024   | 8      |\n| January 2024    | 7      |\n| December 2023   | 17     |\n| November 2023   | 5      |\n| October 2023    | 7      |\n| September 2023  | 7      |\n| August 2023     | 5      |\n| July 2023       | 4      |\n| June 2023       | 12     |\n| May 2023        | 7      |\n| April 2023      | 6      |\n| March 2023      | 10     |\n| February 2023   | 5      |\n| December 2022   | 6      |\n| November 2022   | 8      |\n| October 2022    | 3      |\n| September 2022  | 5      |\n| August 2022     | 7      |\n| July 2022       | 13     |\n| June 2022       | 3      |\n| May 2022        | 4      |\n| April 2022      | 6      |\n| March 2022      | 4      |\n| February 2022   | 9      |\n| January 2022    | 5      |\n| December 2021   | 5      |\n| November 2021   | 1      |\n| October 2021    | 1      |\n| September 2021  | 2      |\n| August 2021     | 8      |\n| July 2021       | 3      |\n| June 2021       | 4      |\n| May 2021        | 3      |\n| April 2021      | 4      |\n| March 2021      | 6      |\n| February 2021   | 5      |\n| December 2020   | 15     |\n| November 2020   | 6      |\n| October 2020    | 11     |\n| September 2020  | 9      |\n| August 2020     | 2      |\n| July 2020       | 15     |\n| June 2020       | 2      |\n| May 2020        | 7      |\n| April 2020      | 8      |\n| March 2020      | 4      |\n| February 2020   | 5      |\n| January 2020    | 2      |\n| December 2019   | 1      |\n| November 2019   | 5      |\n| October 2019    | 8      |\n| September 2019  | 5      |\n\nThe average per month is 6.7. The month of August 2024, with 22 sales, was the record highest since the monthly archive begin, in 2004.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the US State Department approving more than 15 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context and Volume of Sales\n- The US engages in a significant number of arms sales annually. For example, in FY2023, the total value for authorized Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) was $157.5 billion, and for Foreign Military Sales (FMS), it was $80.9 billion.\n- The State Department regularly approves multiple arms sales each quarter, given the volume and frequency of such transactions.\n\n## Approval Process\n- The approval process for arms sales involves formal notifications to Congress, which must be made 30 calendar days before the final steps to conclude a sale can be taken for most countries, and 15 calendar days for sales to NATO member states, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New Zealand.\n- This process suggests that multiple sales can be approved within a single quarter, as the notification periods are relatively short.\n\n## Transparency and Notification\n- While Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) notifications are not made public, Foreign Military Sales (FMS) notifications are publicly available. This transparency for FMS suggests that a significant number of sales are regularly approved and publicly disclosed.\n\n## Recent Trends\n- There is no indication from recent reports or data that the number of arms sales approvals would significantly decrease in the fourth quarter of 2024. Instead, the ongoing geopolitical environment and the continued demand for military equipment suggest a steady or possibly increased rate of approvals.\n\nGiven these points, it is plausible that the US State Department could approve more than 15 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024, considering the historical volume and the ongoing nature of these transactions. However, without specific data on the current pipeline of proposed sales, it is not possible to provide a definitive yes or no answer. The base rate of approvals and the current geopolitical context support the likelihood, but exact numbers would depend on various factors including the specific proposals under review and the timing of their approval.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US government announced any plans to increase arms exports in the fourth quarter of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about the US government announcing plans to increase arms exports in the fourth quarter of 2024. The sources discuss recent trends and figures in arms exports, but they do not mention any specific plans or announcements for the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been reports of large arms deals pending approval by the US State Department in the fourth quarter of 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been reports of large arms deals pending approval by the US State Department in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n- A $2 billion arms sale package to Taiwan, which includes advanced surface-to-air missile systems and radar equipment, was approved by the US State Department in October 2024 and is pending Congressional approval.\n- Other significant arms sales approved and notified in 2024, such as the $20 billion arms sale to Israel and various other deals, indicate ongoing activity in the fourth quarter, even though the specific timing of Congressional approval for some of these may extend beyond this period.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there indications that the US State Department's arms sales approval process has accelerated in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no indications that the US State Department's arms sales approval process has accelerated in 2024. The sources discuss the existing procedures and thresholds for congressional notification and review under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), but they do not mention any changes or accelerations in the approval process specifically for 2024.\n\nHowever, there is a mention of a proposed bill to raise the congressional notification thresholds, which could potentially reduce the number of arms sales submitted for congressional review, but this does not necessarily mean an acceleration of the approval process itself. It rather suggests a potential reduction in oversight.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the fourth quarter historically a period when the US approves more arms sales compared to other quarters?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not offer specific data or analysis on the quarterly distribution of U.S. arms sales approvals. The data presented is mostly annual or based on multi-year periods, and it does not break down the approvals by quarter.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the fourth quarter is historically a period when the U.S. approves more arms sales compared to other quarters is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US Congress introduced new limitations on arms sales approvals in 2024?\nANSWER: No, the US Congress has not introduced new limitations on arms sales approvals in 2024; instead, there are proposals and bills that aim to modify or potentially reduce congressional oversight over arms sales.\n\n- The Tiger Act, introduced by Rep. Mike Waltz, aims to raise the dollar thresholds for congressional notifications on arms sales, which would actually reduce the number of sales subject to congressional review.\n- Other bills, such as the National Security Reforms and Accountability Act (NSRAA), the Safeguarding Human Rights in Arms Exports Act of 2023, and the Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act (SAHRAA), do propose various reforms and additional oversight, but these have not yet been enacted into law.\n\nTherefore, as of now, there are no new limitations on arms sales approvals that have been implemented.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major international allies expressed intent to purchase significant arms from the US in late 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, major international allies have expressed intent to purchase significant arms from the US, even if the specific timeframe of \"late 2024\" is not explicitly mentioned in the sources.\n\n- Poland, for example, has been actively purchasing American-made weapons and has received two loans in the last year to facilitate these purchases, with plans for further acquisitions.\n- India, designated as a “Major Defense Partner” by the U.S., has contracted for nearly $20 billion worth of U.S.-origin defense articles since 2008 and continues to plan significant purchases, including advanced jet engines, UAVs, and other military equipment.\n- European allies, particularly in the context of the Ukraine conflict, have been increasing their arms imports from the U.S. in preparation for potential broader conflicts with Russia.\n\nThese indications suggest that the trend of significant arms purchases from the U.S. by major international allies is likely to continue into late 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any legislative changes in 2024 that could restrict US arms sales approvals?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, there have been legislative proposals and actions in 2024, but they do not appear to restrict US arms sales approvals; instead, they seem to aim at expediting or altering the process.\n\n- The \"TIGER Act\" (H.R. 6609) introduced by Rep. Mike Waltz, which was advanced by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, actually raises the dollar thresholds for arms sales that require congressional notification. This change would reduce the number of arms sales subject to congressional review, rather than restricting approvals.\n\n- Other legislation, such as the \"Safeguarding Human Rights in Arms Exports Act of 2023\" and the \"Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act (SAHRAA),\" introduced in 2023, aim to reform the arms export process with a focus on human rights considerations, but these are not specific to 2024 legislative changes.\n\nTherefore, the current legislative actions in 2024 do not restrict US arms sales approvals; they rather aim to streamline the process.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the US State Department approve more than 15 arms sales globally in any single month of 2024 so far?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, particularly from the sources detailing recent arms sales notifications, it appears that the US State Department has approved multiple arms sales in a single month.\n\nFor example, the August 2024 notifications listed on the Defense Security Cooperation Agency website include several approvals:\n- Croatia: M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems\n- Netherlands: PATRIOT M903 Launching Stations and CH-47 and AH-64 Helicopter Training\n- India: Anti-Submarine Warfare Sonobuoys\n- Australia: AH-64E Apache Sustainment Support Services and FGM-148F Javelin Missiles\n- Romania: AIM-120 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles\n- Norway: Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles–Extended Range\n- Denmark: Excalibur Projectiles\n- Tunisia: 65’ SAFE Archangel Boats\n- Finland: M1156A1 Precision Guidance Kits\n- Republic of Korea: AH-64E Apache Helicopters\n- Israel: Various equipment including F-15 fighter jets, tactical vehicles, and other military gear.\n\nGiven the list of approvals in August 2024 alone, it is clear that more than 15 arms sales were approved in a single month.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any ongoing geopolitical conflicts in 2024 that could escalate the demand for US arms?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several ongoing geopolitical conflicts in 2024 that could escalate the demand for US arms.\n\n1. **Russia-Ukraine Conflict**: The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has significantly increased the demand for air defense systems and other military equipment. European countries are turning to the US for air defense technologies to counter the threats posed by Russia's military actions.\n\n2. **Middle East Conflicts**: The escalating conflicts in the Middle East, including those involving Iran, Israel, and other regional actors, have led to a high demand for US-made air defense systems and other military assets. The US has been deploying military assets, such as THAAD batteries and Patriot systems, to support its allies in the region.\n\n3. **US-China Tensions**: The increasing tensions between the US and China, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, have driven up the demand for US arms among allies such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. These countries are bolstering their military capabilities in response to China's growing military ambitions.\n\n4. **Global Geopolitical Risks**: The broader geopolitical landscape, marked by conflicts and competitions between superpowers, is driving a general increase in arms imports. European states, for example, have nearly doubled their imports of major arms, with a significant portion coming from the US.\n\nThese conflicts and tensions are contributing to a heightened demand for US arms and military technology.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a noticeable increase in US arms sales approvals in the months leading up to November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is evidence of significant arms sales approvals in the recent months, although it does not specifically cover the entire period leading up to November 2024.\n\n- A major arms sale to Israel worth more than $20 billion was approved and notified to Congress on August 13, 2024. This sale includes various military equipment and munitions.\n- There is also mention of increased congressional pressure on the Biden administration to resume and bolster arms shipments to Israel, which has led to legislative actions such as the Israeli Security Assistance Support Act and a resolution condemning the Biden administration’s arms embargo.\n\nWhile these sources indicate significant arms sales approvals, particularly the large sale to Israel, they do not provide a comprehensive overview of all arms sales approvals in the months leading up to November 2024. However, they do suggest an increase in notable arms sales approvals in the recent period.\n\nGiven the specific examples provided, it can be inferred that there has been a noticeable increase in significant arms sales approvals, but the sources do not cover every possible sale.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: There are 2 months left until the outcome is known on January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed**: If nothing changed, based on current trends and recent approvals, the US State Department would approve more than 15 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: If there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately half a month), I would forecast a higher probability, as we would have more concrete data on approvals, reducing uncertainty.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left**: If there was 4 times the time left (approximately 8 months), I would forecast a slightly lower probability due to increased uncertainty about future geopolitical events and policy changes that could affect arms sales approvals.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale**:\n\n- **Historical Averages**: The average number of arms sales approvals per month since 2004 is approximately 6.7, totaling about 20 approvals per quarter. This suggests that exceeding 15 approvals in a quarter is within the typical range.\n\n- **Recent Trends**: In the months leading up to Q4 2024, there has been a notable increase in arms sales approvals:\n  - August 2024: 22 approvals (record high)\n  - September 2024: 12 approvals\n  - October 2024: 9 approvals\n\n- **Geopolitical Factors**:\n  - **Ongoing Conflicts**: The Russia-Ukraine conflict, tensions in the Middle East, and increasing concerns over China have escalated demand for U.S. arms among allies.\n  - **Increased Defense Spending**: Allies such as Poland, India, and various European nations are actively increasing their defense capabilities, leading to more arms purchase agreements.\n\n- **Pending and Recent Deals**:\n  - A $2 billion arms sale to Taiwan was approved in October 2024.\n  - Significant sales to Israel, including a $20 billion package, have been approved in recent months.\n\n- **Legislative Environment**:\n  - No new legislative restrictions on arms sales approvals have been implemented in 2024.\n  - Proposed bills like the TIGER Act aim to streamline the approval process by raising congressional notification thresholds.\n\n- **Seasonal Patterns**:\n  - December often sees higher numbers of approvals, potentially due to end-of-year budget allocations and strategic considerations.\n    - December 2023: 17 approvals\n    - December 2020: 15 approvals\n\n- **Conclusion**: Given the high number of approvals in recent months, ongoing geopolitical tensions driving increased demand, and the historical pattern of higher approvals towards the end of the year, it is highly probable that the US State Department will approve more than 15 arms sales globally in Q4 2024.\n\n**Probability: 90%**",
