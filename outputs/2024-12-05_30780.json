    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Miami have at least 5 days of rain in December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Miami International Airport NWS weather station reports 5 or more days of rain in December 2024 according to [this](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/hist.phtml?station=MIA&network=FL_ASOS&year=2024&month=12) resolution source.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe resolution link is provided for convenience, but please note that if the data is at a different page at the resolution source, then that will be used. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAt the time of this question, Miami is Abnormally Dry according to Drought.gov at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida/county/miami-dade).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine the likelihood of Miami having at least 5 days of rain in December 2024, here are some relevant points from the available sources:\n\n## Historical Averages\n- Miami typically experiences around 6 days with some rain in December, with an average monthly rainfall of 43mm (or 1.7 inches)[1][2][5].\n\n## Specific Forecasts for 2024\n- The National Weather Service (NWS) Climate Prediction Center forecasts below-average precipitation for Miami and much of the Southeast from December 2024 through January 2025[3].\n- The 60-Day Extended Weather Forecast for Florida by Almanac.com suggests that December 2024 will have periods of sunny and warm weather, with some isolated showers, but overall precipitation is expected to be below average (1.5 inches, which is 1 inch below average)[4].\n\n## Base Rates\n- Historically, December is one of the drier months in Miami, with it being the month with the least rain[5].\n\nGiven these points, while it is possible for Miami to have some rainy days in December, the forecasts and historical data suggest that having at least 5 days of rain might be less likely than average due to the expected below-average precipitation for the period.\n\nHowever, the question cannot be answered with a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" without real-time weather data for December 2024, as weather forecasts can be subject to change. The information provided indicates a lower likelihood but does not rule out the possibility entirely.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Miami currently categorized as abnormally dry according to Drought.gov?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, specifically from the Drought Information Statement for South Florida by the National Weather Service, Miami-Dade County is described as follows:\n\n- \"Southern Miami-Dade\" is categorized as \"Abnormally Dry (D0)\"[1].\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Miami (specifically, Southern Miami-Dade) is currently categorized as abnormally dry is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the National Weather Service forecast below-average precipitation for Miami in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information regarding the precipitation forecast for Miami in December 2024. The sources discuss general winter outlooks and ENSO effects, but they do not provide detailed forecasts for specific locations like Miami.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been updates or changes to the December 2024 precipitation forecasts for Miami since the initial prediction?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information regarding updates or changes to the December 2024 precipitation forecasts for Miami. The sources primarily focus on the rainy season outlook for 2024, which ends in October, and do not provide detailed forecasts or updates for December 2024 specifically.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the 60-Day Extended Weather Forecast by Almanac.com predict below-average precipitation for Miami in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided from Almanac.com, the 60-Day Extended Weather Forecast for Miami, FL, predicts that in December 2024, the precipitation will be below average.\n\nHere is the specific detail from the source:\n- \"December | precipitation 1.5\" (1\" below avg.)\"[1][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major weather systems expected to impact Miami's rainfall in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no specific mention of major weather systems such as hurricanes, tropical storms, or other significant weather events that are expected to impact Miami's rainfall in December 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The forecasts from the sources indicate significant rainfall in December, but this is described in terms of general trends and averages rather than specific weather systems[1][2][5].\n- There is no mention of tropical storms or other major weather systems in the provided forecasts for December 2024[1][2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is December traditionally one of the driest months in Miami?\nANSWER: Yes, December is traditionally one of the driest months in Miami. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- December is described as relatively dry compared to other months, with an average precipitation of 2.2-2.4 inches (55-62 mm) over 8 days[3][5].\n- The winter months, including December, are part of the least rainy season in Miami[5].\n- The average rainfall in December is significantly lower than in the summer months, which are the wettest[2][5].\n\nThese points indicate that December is indeed one of the driest months in Miami.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent weather patterns in Miami led to a decrease in December rainfall compared to historical averages?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the recent weather patterns in Miami have not led to a decrease in December rainfall compared to historical averages. Here are the key points:\n\n- The 2023-2024 winter in South Florida, including Miami, saw above-normal rainfall, with December being a notable month for higher-than-average rainfall. A significant rainfall event occurred on December 16th and 17th, 2023, with 2-4 inches of rain across Broward and Palm Beach counties[2].\n- The summary for the 2023-2024 winter indicates that rainfall was above normal across the region, contradicting any decrease in December rainfall[2][3].\n\nTherefore, the recent weather patterns have actually led to an increase in December rainfall compared to historical averages.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Miami historically experienced at least five days of rain in December?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, Miami can experience rainfall in December, but the specific question of whether it has historically experienced at least five days of rain in December is not directly answered.\n\n- The source from Weatherspark indicates that the average sliding 31-day rainfall in December is about 1.4 inches, but it does not provide the number of days with rain[1].\n- The daily climatological records from the National Weather Service do not specify the number of days with rain in December, only providing daily rainfall amounts and other meteorological data[2].\n- The Wikipedia article on Miami's climate discusses the overall rainfall patterns but does not provide detailed daily counts for December[4].\n\nGiven the lack of specific data on the number of rainy days in December, the answer to whether Miami has historically experienced at least five days of rain in December is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current El Niño or La Niña phase expected to influence precipitation levels in Miami for December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the current state of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its expected transition do not specifically address the impact on precipitation levels in Miami for December 2024.\n\nThe sources indicate that as of mid-August 2024, the tropical Pacific is in a neutral state of ENSO, with a possibility of transitioning to La Niña in the coming months[2][4][5].\n\nHowever, none of the sources provide detailed information on how La Niña or the current ENSO-neutral conditions would specifically affect precipitation levels in Miami. General effects of La Niña on global climate patterns are mentioned, such as increased precipitation in some regions and drier conditions in others, but these are not localized to Miami[1][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average number of rainy days in Miami's December from the past five years at least five days?\nANSWER: To determine if the average number of rainy days in Miami's December for the past five years is at least five days, we can refer to the data provided in the sources.\n\nFrom the table in the first source[1], here are the number of days with precipitation (rainfall of 0.01 inches or more) for Miami in December for the past five years:\n\n- 2023: 11 days\n- 2022: 13 days\n- 2021: 6 days\n- 2020: 6 days\n- 2019: 18 days\n\nTo calculate the average:\n\\[\n\\frac{11 + 13 + 6 + 6 + 18}{5} = \\frac{54}{5} = 10.8 \\text{ days}\n\\]\n\nSince the average number of rainy days is 10.8, which is greater than 5, the answer is:\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- There are **26 days left** in December 2024 until the outcome is determined (from December 5 to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- If current conditions remain consistent with historical averages and no significant changes occur, the outcome would be **Yes**, Miami would have at least 5 days of rain in December 2024.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- With only **7 days left** in the month, the forecast would be **90% probability** that Miami has at least 5 days of rain in December 2024.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- Hypothetically extending the timeframe to **104 days**, which is beyond December, the forecast adjusts to account for increased uncertainty, resulting in a **75% probability** of at least 5 days of rain in December 2024.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven that today is December 5, 2024, there are 26 days remaining in the month to accumulate rainfall. Historically, Miami averages around 6 days of rain in December, well above the 5-day threshold posed by the question. Additionally, data from the past five years shows an average of approximately 10.8 rainy days in December, significantly surpassing the required number.\n\nWhile current forecasts from the National Weather Service and Almanac.com indicate below-average precipitation for December 2024, the threshold of 5 rainy days is relatively low compared to historical averages. The abnormally dry categorization suggests a potential for reduced rainfall, but the historical data and recent trends provide strong evidence that reaching at least 5 rainy days is highly probable.\n\nConsidering different timeframes:\n- With **full time remaining (26 days)**, the historical and recent averages strongly support a high probability.\n- With **only a quarter of the time left (7 days)**, the likelihood remains high due to the historical frequency of rainy days.\n- Extending to **4x the time left (104 days)** introduces more uncertainty, but the fundamental climate patterns still favor exceeding the 5-day threshold.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the probability that Miami will have at least 5 days of rain in December 2024 remains high.\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
