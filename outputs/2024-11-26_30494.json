    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the temperature in San Francisco, CA ever go below 40 degrees F in the entire month of December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-26\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the low temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is ever below 40 degrees for the downtown San Francisco weather station, as reported [here](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/hist.phtml?station=SFOC1&network=CA_DCP&year=2024&month=12). If the low for any day has not been below that, then this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nMissing data for any of the observed values (coded by the NWS as \"MM\") will not be considered. No other resolution source other than the Data Calendar posted at Iowa State University will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn December 2022 the lowest recorded temperature was 40 F, while in December 2023 it was 46.13. According to [Iowa State University](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/), \"The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) collects environmental data from cooperating members with observing networks. The data are stored and made available on this website.\" \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine the likelihood of the temperature in San Francisco, CA going below 40 degrees F (approximately 4.4°C) in December 2024, here are some key points from the available sources:\n\n## Historical Temperature Ranges\n- The average high temperatures in San Francisco during December are around 59°F (15°C) to 60°F (15.5°C), while the average low temperatures are around 48°F (9°C) to 50°F (10°C)[2][4][5].\n\n## Lowest Recorded Temperatures\n- The lowest recorded temperature in December in San Francisco was -2°C (28.4°F) in 1990, which is significantly below 40°F (4.4°C)[5].\n\n## Typical December Weather\n- December is characterized by cool and wet conditions, but temperatures rarely drop below freezing. The average low temperatures for the month are well above 40°F (4.4°C)[2][4][5].\n\nGiven these points, it is highly unlikely that the temperature in San Francisco will go below 40°F (4.4°C) in the entire month of December 2024, based on historical data and typical weather patterns for the region.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is not impossible for temperatures to drop unexpectedly, the historical data and typical weather patterns suggest that temperatures below 40°F (4.4°C) are extremely rare in San Francisco during December. Therefore, the answer to whether the temperature will go below 40 degrees F in December 2024 is likely \"no,\" but it cannot be ruled out entirely without real-time forecasting.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any expected atmospheric blocking events that could cause prolonged cold spells in San Francisco in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of expected atmospheric blocking events or prolonged cold spells in San Francisco for December 2024. The sources focus on the immediate effects of the atmospheric river and bomb cyclone in November 2024, but do not provide forecasts or discussions about weather patterns for December.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant changes in local infrastructure or urban development in San Francisco that could impact December temperatures in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no specific mentions of infrastructure or urban development changes in San Francisco that would directly impact December temperatures in 2024. The sources discuss various infrastructure projects, such as street resurfacing, sewer system improvements, transportation upgrades, and public space enhancements, but none of these are linked to climate or temperature changes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current winter forecast for California indicating colder than average temperatures for San Francisco in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the forecast for California does not specifically indicate colder than average temperatures for San Francisco in December 2024.\n\n- The forecasts mention that Northern and Central California have equal chances of below-average, near-average, or above-average temperatures[2][3][4].\n- There is no specific indication that San Francisco, which is in Northern California, will experience colder than average temperatures.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent climate models predicted a significant drop in December temperatures for San Francisco in 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources provided do not indicate a significant drop in December temperatures for San Francisco in 2024. Instead, they suggest the following:\n\n- December temperatures in San Francisco are expected to be around highs of 59°F to 56°F and lows of 48°F to 45°F (9°C to 15°C), which is relatively consistent with historical averages[1][2].\n- There is an expectation of warmer and drier conditions due to the La Niña pattern, which does not suggest a significant drop in temperatures[4].\n- Climate change analysis shows that San Francisco experienced warmer winter days, which aligns with the overall trend of slightly above normal temperatures rather than a significant drop[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an active La Niña or El Niño event expected to influence December 2024 weather patterns in San Francisco?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is a prediction for a La Niña event to influence the weather patterns in the upcoming winter, including December 2024.\n\n- A weak La Niña is expected to develop and influence temperatures, precipitation, and snow across the United States, including the winter months[3][4].\n- The Climate Prediction Center forecasts a weak La Niña to emerge in the next couple of months and persist through the Northern Hemisphere winter, which includes December 2024[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, it is expected that a La Niña event, rather than an El Niño event, will influence the weather patterns in San Francisco in December 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Will San Francisco have experienced a daily low temperature below 40°F in December during any year in the past three decades?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, we can determine that San Francisco has experienced daily low temperatures below 40°F (4°C) in December during the past three decades, although such occurrences are rare.\n\n- The source from Current Results lists the lowest temperatures for each year in San Francisco, including December. For example, in 2013, the lowest temperature was 36°F (2°C) on December 9th, and in 2016, it was 40°F (4°C) on December 18th. There are several instances where the temperature dipped below 40°F in December over the past three decades[2].\n- Another source confirms that temperatures below 40°F are rare but do occur, especially on colder nights[1][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any reported early cold fronts or cold air masses moving into the San Francisco area in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no specific mention of early cold fronts or cold air masses moving into the San Francisco area in December 2024. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The sources indicate that December 2024 is expected to be relatively mild, with temperatures slightly above historical averages[1][2][5].\n- There are predictions of cooler periods, but these are generally described as part of the normal temperature fluctuations for the month, such as the coldest temperatures occurring in mid-December and mid- to late January, according to long-term forecasts[3].\n- There is no specific mention of early cold fronts or unusual cold air masses in the provided sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as the sources do not provide explicit information about early cold fronts or cold air masses in December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any unusual weather patterns or anomalies observed in San Francisco leading up to December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several unusual weather patterns and anomalies observed in the San Francisco area leading up to December 2024.\n\n1. **Severe Heat Wave**: In early October, the San Francisco Bay Area experienced a rare and severe heat wave, with temperatures significantly above normal. Inland areas reached up to 110 degrees, and coastal areas saw temperatures in the 90s, which is unusual for the fall season[1].\n\n2. **Atmospheric River and Bomb Cyclone**: In late November, a powerful atmospheric river coupled with a bomb cyclone impacted Northern California, bringing heavy rains, damaging winds, and significant snowfall in the mountains. This event led to flash flood risks, power outages, and hazardous travel conditions[2][3].\n\nThese events highlight the unusual and extreme weather patterns that have affected the region in recent months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the urban heat island effect in downtown San Francisco strong enough to prevent temperatures from dropping below 40°F in December 2024?\nANSWER: The urban heat island effect in San Francisco does contribute to higher temperatures in urban areas compared to rural areas, but it does not prevent temperatures from dropping to lower levels, especially during cooler months.\n\n- The urban heat island effect is more significant during hot summer months, causing higher temperatures in urban areas due to heat-absorbing surfaces, lack of vegetation, and other factors[3][4][5].\n- San Francisco's unique topography and coastal location also play a role in its temperature regulation, with cool ocean air often mitigating extreme heat[2][3].\n- There is no indication in the sources that the urban heat island effect would be strong enough to prevent temperatures from dropping below 40°F (4°C) in December, which is one of the cooler months in San Francisco.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the historical trend of low December temperatures in San Francisco shown any recent signs of decreasing?\nANSWER: To determine if the historical trend of low December temperatures in San Francisco has shown any recent signs of decreasing, we need to examine the long-term temperature trends and recent data.\n\n1. **Long-term Trends**: Historical data from sources like ClimateStations.com and other climate records indicate that San Francisco's temperatures have fluctuated over the years, with some periods being warmer or cooler than others. However, there is no clear consistent downward trend in low December temperatures over the long term[4].\n\n2. **Recent Data**: Looking at more recent data, such as the historical weather records for December in the past few years, does not indicate a significant decrease in low temperatures. For example, the average low temperatures in December 2021 and 2022 were still within the typical range for San Francisco, with no notable decrease[3][5].\n\n3. **General Climate Trends**: While there are general trends of global warming, the specific trend for low December temperatures in San Francisco does not show a recent decrease. Instead, the temperatures remain relatively stable within the expected range for the month[1][2].\n\nGiven this information, there is no clear evidence to suggest that the low December temperatures in San Francisco have recently decreased.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as there is no clear evidence of a recent decrease, but also no definitive proof against it)",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- **Time Left:** Approximately 35 days (from November 26, 2024, to December 31, 2024, with a possible extension until January 7, 2025, if resolution is delayed).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- **Outcome if Nothing Changed:** **No**. Historically, San Francisco rarely experiences temperatures below 40°F in December. The last two years recorded lows at 40°F and 46.13°F, respectively.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- **Forecast with Quarter Time Left (≈9 days):** **Low likelihood of occurrence.** Short-term forecasts do not indicate any unusual cold spells that would significantly increase the probability of temperatures dropping below 40°F.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- **Forecast with 4x Time Left (≈140 days):** **Slightly higher probability,** but still low. Extended time allows for more variability, but given historical data and typical weather patterns, the likelihood remains minimal.\n\n**Rationale:**\nSan Francisco's December temperatures are generally mild, with average lows around 48°F to 50°F. Historical records over the past three decades show that temperatures below 40°F are rare but have occurred sporadically. The recent years (2022 and 2023) had lows at 40°F and 46.13°F, indicating that while possible, such cold spells are uncommon. The current weather forecasts do not predict any significant atmospheric events that would drastically lower temperatures. Additionally, the urban heat island effect provides some temperature moderation, though it isn't strong enough to prevent temperatures from dropping below 40°F entirely. Considering these factors, the probability remains low but not negligible.\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
