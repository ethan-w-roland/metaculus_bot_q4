    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore 2025, will OpenAI's commercial operations cease to be governed by its nonprofit board of directors?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-14\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves \"Yes\" if, before January 1, 2025, [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) report that OpenAI's commercial operations (such operations, as of the writing of this question, are housed under OpenAI Global LLC) are no longer governed by the nonprofit board of directors of OpenAI Inc.\n\n* **Resolution in the Event of Restructuring, Merger, etc.**—If, through corporate restructuring, merger, acquisition, transfer of assets (including intellectual property) or by other means, all or a substantial portion of OpenAI's commercial operations are transferred to another entity that is not controlled by the nonprofit board of directors of OpenAI, this question would resolve \"Yes\".\n\n* **Resolution in the Event of a Mass Departure of Staff to a Competitor or New Entity**—If within a 180-day period, more than 50% of employees of OpenAI Global LLC (or a successor entity that is still under the control of the nonprofit board) housing OpenAI's commercial activities become employees of another single entity that is not controlled by the nonprofit board of OpenAI Inc., this would be considered a substantial transfer of OpenAI's intellectual property, and this question would resolve \"Yes\".\n\nBACKGROUND:\nOpenAI Inc., a Delaware 501(c)3 nonprofit corporation, was founded in late 2015. At its [inception](https://web.archive.org/web/20151222103150/https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai/), OpenAI's mission and corporate structure were intended to maximize and broadly distribute the benefits of AI for humanity while minimizing the risks of such a potentially transformative—and possibly harmful—technology.\n\nThe [tumultuous events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI#2023%E2%80%93present:_Brief_departure_of_Altman_and_Brockman) of November 17-21, 2023 culminated in a [reconstitution](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/22/sam-altmans-back-heres-whos-on-the-new-openai-board-and-whos-out.html) of the nonprofit's board of directors and, along with it, [speculation](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/technology/openai-board-capitalists.html) regarding whether the company's original mission and structure will remain intact.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information available, it is likely that OpenAI's commercial operations will cease to be governed by its nonprofit board of directors before 2025.\n\nOpenAI is planning to restructure from a nonprofit to a for-profit benefit corporation. This change involves removing the nonprofit board's oversight of the for-profit operations. Here are the key points:\n\n- OpenAI plans to transform its complex corporate structure, shedding its nonprofit status and becoming a more traditional for-profit company, a process expected to be completed at some point in 2025[4][5].\n- The nonprofit OpenAI will continue to exist but will no longer oversee the operations of the for-profit entity. Instead, it will maintain a minority stake in the new for-profit company[5].\n- This restructuring is designed to enhance OpenAI's appeal to investors by offering greater equity opportunities and removing return caps[5].\n\nGiven that the details are still being finalized and significant changes have already begun, such as the elevation of the Safety and Security Committee to an independent board oversight body, it is clear that the governance structure is undergoing significant changes that will likely be implemented before 2025[5].\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI completed its planned transformation into a for-profit benefit corporation?\nANSWER: No, OpenAI has not yet completed its planned transformation into a for-profit benefit corporation. The sources indicate that the company is considering and planning this restructuring, but no final decision has been made, and the timing of the shift has not been determined[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI secured new investors or funding contingent upon changing its governance structure?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication that OpenAI has secured new investors or funding contingent upon changing its governance structure.\n\nWhile the sources do mention discussions about potentially restructuring OpenAI into a for-profit entity, this is not tied to the securing of new funding. The funding round itself and the involvement of new investors are described without any conditions related to governance structure changes[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is OpenAI currently engaged in a restructuring process to transition its commercial operations away from nonprofit board governance?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nOpenAI is indeed in the process of restructuring to transition its commercial operations away from nonprofit board governance. The company is planning to restructure as a for-profit public-benefit corporation, which would end the oversight by its current nonprofit board and give more influence to shareholders[1][2][5]. This change is part of a broader strategy to attract more investments and align with the financial expectations of its investors.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI officially announced that its commercial operations will no longer be governed by its nonprofit board before 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, OpenAI has announced plans to revamp its corporate structure, but it has not yet officially implemented the changes.\n\n- OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, has informed employees that the company will transform its complex corporate structure, including shedding its non-profit status, at some point in 2025[5].\n- This indicates that while the decision has been made, the actual transition has not been completed before 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have more than 50% of OpenAI's commercial staff moved to a different entity not controlled by the nonprofit board within a 180-day period?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that more than 50% of OpenAI's commercial staff have moved to a different entity not controlled by the nonprofit board within a 180-day period.\n\nThe sources discuss significant changes in OpenAI's structure, including the planned transition from a nonprofit-controlled entity to a more traditional for-profit organization, and they mention several high-profile departures and restructuring. However, they do not provide the specific statistics or details needed to determine if more than 50% of the commercial staff have moved within the specified timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any regulatory approvals granted for OpenAI to restructure its corporate governance?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that regulatory approvals have been granted for OpenAI's proposed restructuring. The sources mention that OpenAI is in the process of discussing and planning the restructuring, and that it is engaging with regulators and legal experts to navigate the necessary legal and regulatory considerations. However, they do not state that any final approvals have been obtained.\n\nFor example, [1] mentions early discussions with the California attorney general’s office, and [2] notes that any change would require navigating the laws governing tax-exempt organizations, but neither source indicates that the approvals have been granted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI's nonprofit organization ceased to exist or relinquished control over the commercial entity?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that OpenAI's nonprofit organization has not yet ceased to exist or relinquished control over its commercial entities, although there are ongoing discussions and considerations about restructuring.\n\n- OpenAI's board is considering a decision to change the company's structure, potentially converting it into a public benefit corporation, but no final decision has been made[1][2][3].\n- The nonprofit arm of OpenAI is stated to be \"core to our mission and will continue to exist\"[1].\n- There are ongoing discussions and legal considerations, but the current structure remains in place[2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI's nonprofit board of directors been replaced or restructured in a way that removes its governance over commercial operations?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether OpenAI's nonprofit board of directors has been replaced or restructured in a way that removes its governance over commercial operations, as the process is still under consideration and no final decision has been made.\n\n- The sources indicate that OpenAI's board is considering a decision to convert the company into a public benefit corporation, which would change its governance structure. However, this change has not yet been implemented[1][2][5].\n- The current governance structure, where the nonprofit board controls the for-profit subsidiaries, is still in place, and any changes would require navigating complex legal and regulatory considerations[1][2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have credible sources reported that OpenAI's commercial operations are now governed by a different entity than the nonprofit board?\nANSWER: Yes, credible sources have reported that OpenAI's commercial operations are undergoing significant changes in their governance structure, although the exact nature of the separation is still in transition.\n\n- OpenAI originally operated under a nonprofit board and added a for-profit arm in 2019. However, recent developments indicate that OpenAI is transitioning towards a more integrated for-profit model. The nonprofit board, which previously governed the entire organization, is expected to retain only a minority stake in the future[5].\n\n- The company is in the process of converting its operations to a fully for-profit entity, with the nonprofit retaining assets and a minority stake. This involves complex steps such as asset conversion and translating investor stakes into equity in the new company[5].\n\n- The governance of the new for-profit entity and its relationship to the nonprofit is a key aspect of this transition, indicating a shift in how the commercial operations will be governed[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been significant delays or obstacles reported that would prevent OpenAI from completing its restructuring before 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been significant delays and obstacles reported that could prevent or complicate OpenAI's restructuring before 2025.\n\n1. **Board Restructuring Delays**: The nonprofit's board has shrunk to three members with no additions despite commitments, raising questions about the oversight of OpenAI's endeavors. Progress on the promised new board and independent review of Altman’s leadership remains unclear[1].\n\n2. **Leadership Changes and Departures**: The company has faced numerous executive departures, including key figures like Mira Murati, Ilya Sutskever, and Jan Leike, which have added to the instability and could slow down the restructuring process[3][5].\n\n3. **Financial and Governance Issues**: OpenAI is considering a transition to a for-profit model, but this change is not without its challenges. The shift from a nonprofit to a for-profit structure has drawn criticism and raised concerns about the company's commitment to its original humanitarian mission. This transition is still in the evaluation phase and has not been finalized[2][4][5].\n\n4. **Operational and Financial Pressures**: OpenAI is facing significant financial pressures, including high operating costs and anticipated losses, which could impact the speed and success of any restructuring efforts[3].\n\nThese factors collectively indicate that the restructuring process is fraught with delays and obstacles.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n- Approximately **47 days** remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n- If nothing changes, the outcome would be **\"No\"**—OpenAI's commercial operations will continue to be governed by its nonprofit board of directors.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n- With about **12 days** left, the probability of significant restructuring is even lower. I would forecast a **10%** chance of the question resolving as \"Yes.\"\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n- Since the deadline is fixed at January 1, 2025, we cannot extend the time. However, hypothetically, if there were **188 days** left, the probability would increase modestly. I would forecast a **25%** chance of the question resolving as \"Yes.\"\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the information available as of **November 14, 2024**, here's the analysis:\n\n1. **Status of Restructuring:**\n   - OpenAI **has not completed** its planned transformation into a for-profit benefit corporation.\n   - Discussions and plans are underway, but **no final decisions or implementations** have occurred.\n\n2. **Regulatory Approvals and Legal Challenges:**\n   - There are **no reports** of regulatory approvals granted for the restructuring.\n   - Navigating laws governing tax-exempt organizations is complex and time-consuming.\n   - Legal and regulatory hurdles could delay or prevent restructuring before the deadline.\n\n3. **Leadership Changes and Organizational Stability:**\n   - There have been **significant leadership changes and departures**, including key executives.\n   - This internal instability may slow down decision-making and implementation of major changes.\n\n4. **Financial Pressures and Investor Relations:**\n   - OpenAI faces **financial pressures**, including high operating costs and anticipated losses.\n   - While there's an interest in attracting more investors, changes to governance structures require careful negotiation.\n\n5. **Time Constraints:**\n   - With only **47 days** remaining, it's **unlikely** that OpenAI can complete the necessary steps:\n     - Finalizing decisions on restructuring.\n     - Obtaining required regulatory approvals.\n     - Executing the legal and organizational changes.\n\n6. **Historical Precedents:**\n   - Major corporate restructurings typically take **several months to years** to complete.\n   - Given that OpenAI has been considering restructuring since at least **2023**, and has not completed it by late **2024**, the likelihood of completion in the next 47 days is low.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile there is a possibility that OpenAI could expedite its restructuring process, the combination of legal complexities, organizational challenges, and limited time make it **unlikely** that OpenAI's commercial operations will cease to be governed by its nonprofit board before January 1, 2025.\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
