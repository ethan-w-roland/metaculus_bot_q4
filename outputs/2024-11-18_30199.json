    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Federal Register list exactly zero executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024? \n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-18\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Federal Register, which can be accessed [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2024), lists exactly 0 executive orders for President Joe Biden for the month of December 2024. If it lists >0, this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Joe Biden's executive orders and actions](https://ballotpedia.org/Joe_Biden%27s_executive_orders_and_actions)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the Federal Register will list exactly zero executive orders by President Joe Biden for December 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Data and Trends\n- The Federal Register and the Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents provide comprehensive records of presidential actions, including executive orders. Historically, presidents have issued executive orders throughout their terms, and it is uncommon for a month to pass without any executive orders being issued[1][4][5].\n\n## Current Data Availability\n- As of the current date (November 19, 2024), there is already documentation of executive orders issued by President Joe Biden in 2024. For example, 13 executive orders were signed by President Biden from EO 14115 through EO 14127 earlier in 2024[5].\n\n## Predictive Factors\n- The issuance of executive orders is influenced by various factors, including legislative needs, administrative requirements, and policy initiatives. Given the ongoing nature of presidential duties, it is unlikely that a full month would pass without any executive orders being issued.\n\n## Base Rates\n- The base rate of executive orders being issued in any given month is generally positive, meaning it is rare for a month to have zero executive orders.\n\nGiven these points, while it is impossible to predict with absolute certainty, the historical and current trends suggest that it is unlikely for there to be exactly zero executive orders by President Joe Biden in December 2024. However, this cannot be definitively answered as yes or no without access to future data or specific announcements from the White House.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any indication from official White House communications that President Biden plans to issue executive orders in December 2024?\nANSWER: There is no indication from the provided sources that President Biden plans to issue executive orders in December 2024. The sources list and describe various executive orders that have already been issued, but they do not mention any plans or announcements for future executive orders specifically in December 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do U.S. presidents typically issue executive orders during the month of December?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, there is no specific indication that U.S. presidents do or do not typically issue executive orders during the month of December. The sources provide general information about executive orders, their history, and the processes involved, but they do not offer specific data or patterns related to the timing of executive order issuance, including the month of December.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have legal or political factors emerged that might prevent President Biden from issuing executive orders in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of any legal or political factors that would prevent President Biden from issuing executive orders in December 2024. The sources discuss various executive orders and their implementations, but they do not mention any limitations or obstacles that would hinder the President's ability to issue executive orders in the future.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden's frequency of issuing executive orders decreased in recent months leading up to December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or analysis that compares the frequency of President Joe Biden's executive orders in recent months leading up to December 2024 to his earlier issuance rates.\n\n- The sources do provide the total number of executive orders signed by Biden in 2024 (25 as of the time the sources were written)[2][5], but they do not offer a monthly breakdown or comparison of the issuance rates over time.\n- Therefore, it is unclear whether the frequency of issuing executive orders has decreased in recent months.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden issued at least one executive order in every month prior to December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether President Joe Biden has issued at least one executive order in every month prior to December 2024.\n\n- The sources provide specific examples of executive orders issued by President Biden in certain months, such as July 2024 and June 2024[2][4], but they do not provide a comprehensive list of executive orders for every month.\n- There is no detailed monthly breakdown of all the executive orders issued by President Biden, which would be necessary to determine if he has issued at least one executive order in every month.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there historical precedent for a U.S. president not issuing any executive orders in December?\nANSWER: Yes, there is historical precedent for a U.S. president not issuing any executive orders in a given month, including December.\n\nWhile the sources provided do not specify the monthly distribution of executive orders for every president, they do indicate that the frequency and timing of executive orders can vary significantly. For example, the tables and descriptions show that some presidents issued very few executive orders overall, and it is plausible that some months, including December, could pass without any executive orders being issued.\n\nGiven the variability in the number of executive orders issued by different presidents and the lack of detailed monthly breakdowns in the provided sources, it is clear that there have been periods where no executive orders were issued in a particular month[1][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Biden historically issued fewer executive orders in December compared to other months?\nANSWER: To determine if President Biden has historically issued fewer executive orders in December compared to other months, we need to analyze the distribution of his executive orders over time.\n\nWhile the sources provided do not offer a month-by-month breakdown of the executive orders issued by President Biden, they do list the executive orders chronologically. Here are some key points:\n\n- The sources list the executive orders issued by President Biden from January 2021 onward, but they do not provide a detailed monthly distribution[2][4][5].\n\nWithout specific data on the monthly distribution of executive orders, it is not possible to definitively conclude whether President Biden has issued fewer executive orders in December compared to other months.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming deadlines or expiring policies that would require executive action from President Biden in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several deadlines and requirements that could necessitate executive action or compliance from federal agencies in December 2024, although they may not necessarily require direct executive action from President Biden himself.\n\n1. **AI Use Case Inventories and Risk Management Practices**:\n   - Federal agencies (excluding the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community) must submit AI use case inventories for 2024 by December 16, 2024, as per the OMB Guidance for 2024 Agency Artificial Intelligence Reporting under Executive Order 14110[2].\n   - Agencies must also determine whether their current and planned AI use cases are safety- or rights-impacting and submit any necessary waivers or requests for one-year extensions by December 1, 2024[2].\n\nThese deadlines indicate that while the actions are primarily the responsibility of federal agencies, they are part of the broader implementation of President Biden's executive orders and policies.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the holiday season or end-of-year congressional recess typically affect the issuance of executive orders?\nANSWER: The holiday season and end-of-year congressional recess do not inherently affect the issuance of executive orders in a systematic or mandatory way. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Executive Orders Can Be Issued at Any Time**: The President has the authority to issue executive orders at any time, regardless of the holiday season or congressional recess. There is no legal or procedural barrier that prevents the issuance of executive orders during these periods[2][3][5].\n\n2. **Holiday Season Practices**: While it is common for presidents to issue executive orders granting federal employees additional time off around the holidays, this is a discretionary action and not a requirement. The decision to grant extra time off is often made on a case-by-case basis, depending on various factors including the calendar and administrative needs[2][3][4].\n\n3. **Administrative Continuity**: Government operations, including the issuance of executive orders, generally continue even during holiday seasons and congressional recesses. The President and relevant administrative bodies remain capable of performing their duties without interruption.\n\nTherefore, the holiday season or end-of-year congressional recess does not typically affect the issuance of executive orders in a mandatory or systematic way.\n\n**YES** (in the sense that it does not affect the ability to issue executive orders, but it may influence discretionary decisions related to holidays).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any known policy initiatives or crises that might necessitate executive orders from President Biden in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several ongoing and upcoming requirements and initiatives that could potentially necessitate executive orders or further action from President Biden in December 2024:\n\n## AI Use Case Inventories and Risk Management\nExecutive Order 14110 on the “Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence” requires federal agencies to submit AI use case inventories by December 16, 2024, and to address specific risk management practices by December 1, 2024. This could lead to additional executive actions or guidance to ensure compliance[3].\n\n## Workforce Development and Job Creation\nThe Executive Order on \"Investing in America and Investing in American Workers\" (Executive Order 14126) establishes the Investing in Good Jobs Task Force, which may require ongoing policy development and implementation, potentially leading to further executive orders or actions in December 2024[1].\n\n## Other Ongoing Initiatives\nVarious other executive orders and initiatives, such as those related to environmental justice, public health, and national security, may also require continued or new executive actions as they evolve and as new challenges arise[2][5].\n\nWhile these sources do not specify particular crises or initiatives that will definitely necessitate executive orders in December 2024, they indicate ongoing and complex policy areas that could require further executive action.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a)** Time left until the outcome is known: Approximately 1.5 months.\n\n**(b)** What the outcome would be if nothing changed: If President Biden continues his usual pattern of issuing executive orders, the Federal Register will list **at least one** executive order for December 2024. Therefore, the outcome would be **No** (the question would resolve as false).\n\n**(c)** What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left: With about 11 days left until December, my forecast would remain largely the same. The probability that zero executive orders will be issued in December 2024 would be slightly lower due to the decreased likelihood of unexpected events changing this pattern. I might adjust my probability estimate marginally downward.\n\n**(d)** What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left: If there were about 6 months left until December 2024, my forecast might incorporate slightly more uncertainty due to the extended time horizon. However, given the consistency of executive order issuance throughout presidential terms, the probability would not significantly change.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Precedent**: Historically, U.S. presidents, including President Joe Biden, issue executive orders regularly throughout their terms. Executive orders are a common tool for implementing policy initiatives and responding to emergent issues. It is uncommon for a full month to pass without at least one executive order being issued.\n\n- **Base Rates**: Analyzing President Biden's term up to this point, there have been few, if any, months without an executive order. While the exact monthly distribution is unclear due to the lack of specific data, the base rate suggests that months with zero executive orders are rare.\n\n- **December Patterns**: There is no evidence to suggest that December is a month during which presidents typically refrain from issuing executive orders. The holiday season and congressional recess do not impede the president's ability to issue executive orders.\n\n- **Upcoming Deadlines and Initiatives**: There are ongoing policy areas and deadlines that could necessitate executive action in December 2024. For example, federal agencies are required to submit AI use case inventories and address risk management practices in December under Executive Order 14110. While these are agency responsibilities, they are part of broader initiatives that may prompt further executive actions.\n\n- **No Preventative Factors**: There are no known legal or political factors that would prevent President Biden from issuing executive orders in December 2024. Unless unforeseen circumstances arise, the mechanisms for issuing executive orders remain in place.\n\n- **Likelihood Assessment**: Given the regularity with which executive orders are issued and the lack of factors indicating a departure from this pattern, the probability of zero executive orders in December 2024 is low.\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
