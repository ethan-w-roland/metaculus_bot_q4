    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill there be greater than or equal to 3,900 emojis on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThe question will resolve according to the total number of Emojis reported in the [Emoji Counts](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-counts.html) table published by Unicode, Inc.\n\nIf no Emoji Counts chart is published by Unicode, Inc. at that location, Metaculus moderators may determine the count according to numbers published by Unicode, Inc. or a successor organization elsewhere. \n\nIf the latest version of the Unicode standard at resolution time is not 19.0, the question will be resolved according to the latest released version. This also applies if the standard ceases to be updated or published in the meantime\n\nBACKGROUND:\nJuly 17th is World Emoji Day. This day is typically used by platform vendors to announce new emojis supported on their platform. \n\nEmojis are a subsection of the Unicode standard, and by World Emoji Day, the upcoming version of the yearly Unicode standard is in a very stable state, so that the total number of Emojis can be determined.\n\nThe number of Emojis has increased steadily since [Unicode v11.0 in 2018 when it was at 2789](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts-11.0/emoji-counts.html) to [3633 in Unicode v14.0, published 2021](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts-14.0/emoji-counts.html).\n\nWhat will be the growth trend of Emojis in the next five years and how many emojis will be there in Unicode 19.0, expected in 2026?\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether there will be greater than or equal to 3,900 emojis by December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Current State of Emojis\nAs of the latest updates, the Unicode Consortium, which is responsible for standardizing emojis, has been continually adding new emojis to the Unicode Standard. For example, Unicode 15.0, released in 2022, added new emojis, and subsequent versions are expected to follow suit.\n\n## Historical Trends\nThe number of emojis has been increasing with each new version of the Unicode Standard. For instance, Unicode 14.0 and Unicode 15.0 each added significant numbers of new emojis, indicating a trend of continuous expansion.\n\n## Future Updates\nThe Unicode Consortium typically releases new versions of the Unicode Standard on an annual basis. Given the historical trend, it is likely that new emojis will be added in 2024, contributing to the overall count.\n\n## Base Rates\nAs of recent years, the total number of emojis has been well over 3,000. For example, Unicode 14.0 included over 3,300 emojis, and Unicode 15.0 added more. This suggests that the threshold of 3,900 emojis is likely to be exceeded given the ongoing additions.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the historical trend of increasing emoji counts with each new Unicode Standard release, and considering the current number of emojis already exceeds 3,000, it is highly probable that there will be greater than or equal to 3,900 emojis by December 31, 2024.\n\n### Answer Clarity\nBased on the available information, the answer to whether there will be greater than or equal to 3,900 emojis by December 31, 2024, can be reasonably inferred as \"yes,\" given the consistent trend of adding new emojis and the current state of the Unicode Standard.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there currently fewer than 3,900 emojis as of the latest Unicode release?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nAs of the latest Unicode release, Unicode 16.0, there are a total of 3,790 emojis recommended by Unicode for general interchange across digital devices. This number includes all unique emoji characters along with their variations such as skin tones, gender variations, and other modifiers.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Unicode Consortium scheduled to release a new version of Unicode before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe latest version of the Unicode Standard, Unicode 16.0, was released on September 10, 2024, and there is no mention of another version scheduled for release before December 31, 2024, in the provided sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major stakeholders proposed large numbers of new emojis that are likely to be approved before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: No, the current proposals for new emojis do not include large numbers that are likely to be approved before December 31, 2024. The latest set of emojis, Emoji 16.0, consists of only eight new emoji concepts, which are expected to be approved on September 10, 2024, and will be rolled out across major platforms in late 2024 and into 2025. This is the smallest set of emojis proposed in recent history.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant delays in Unicode releases that could affect the addition of new emojis before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been significant delays in Unicode releases that could affect the addition of new emojis.\n\nOne notable delay was the six-month delay of Unicode 14.0 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This delay, announced in April 2020, pushed the release of Unicode 14.0 from March 2021 to September 2021, which in turn delayed the rollout of new emojis to late 2021 or early 2022.\n\nAdditionally, there was a mention of a \"dot\" release for Unicode in 2023 with limited character additions, and the next major release was scheduled for 2024. This adjustment in the release cycle could also impact the timing of new emoji additions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any reason to believe that the total count of emojis will not increase significantly before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, there is no reason to believe that the total count of emojis will not increase significantly before December 31, 2024.\n\nHere are some points to consider:\n\n- The Unicode Consortium regularly updates and adds new emojis to the Unicode Standard. For example, as of September 2023, there are 3,782 emojis, including 118 new ones from Emoji 15.1.\n- The trend of adding new emojis continues, as evidenced by the periodic releases of new emoji sets, such as Emoji 15.1.\n\nGiven this pattern of continuous updates and additions, it is reasonable to expect that the total count of emojis will increase before December 31, 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any announcements of new emojis that would bring the total count to 3,900 or more by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there have been announcements of new emojis, but they do not indicate that the total count will reach 3,900 or more by December 31, 2024.\n\nThe sources mention the addition of 8 new emojis as part of Unicode 16.0, which will be rolled out over the next few months and throughout 2025.\n\nAdditionally, there was an earlier update with 118 new emojis as part of Emoji 15.1, which is already being implemented in iOS 17.4.\n\nHowever, none of the sources specify that these additions will bring the total count to 3,900 or more by the end of 2024. The current total mentioned is 154,998 characters, including emojis, but this does not directly translate to the emoji count alone.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the rate of emoji additions been consistent over the past few years?\nANSWER: The rate of emoji additions has not been consistent over the past few years, although new emojis are approved and added annually.\n\n- The Unicode Consortium approves new emoji sets each year, but the number of new emojis can vary. For example, the consortium has continued to add new emojis annually, such as the recent Emoji 16.0 release and the upcoming Emoji 17.0 scheduled for 2025.\n- The process involves submitting formal proposals, which are reviewed and approved by a committee. This process can result in varying numbers of new emojis being added each year, depending on the number and quality of proposals submitted and approved.\n- There has been a steady increase in the total number of emojis, with 3,790 emojis in the Unicode Standard as of September 2024, but the annual additions can fluctuate.\n\nTherefore, while new emojis are added every year, the consistency in the exact number of additions can vary. So, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a trend of increasing diversity and inclusivity leading to more emoji additions in recent years?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a clear trend of increasing diversity and inclusivity leading to more emoji additions in recent years.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the growing demand for more inclusive and representative emojis. Adobe's Global Emoji Diversity and Inclusion Report found that 83% of users believe emojis should have more inclusive options, and only half of global emoji users feel their identity is adequately reflected in current emoji options.\n\nThe introduction of diverse skin tones, gender-neutral options, and emojis representing various cultures, professions, and activities are examples of this trend. For instance, emojis such as those for sari, hijab, bubble tea, and diverse family representations have been added to better reflect the diversity of users.\n\nAdditionally, there is ongoing work to address the needs of users with disabilities, with additions like wheelchair, cane, and hearing aids emojis, further indicating the commitment to increasing inclusivity.\n\nOverall, these developments demonstrate a consistent effort to expand the range of emojis to be more representative and inclusive.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average number of emojis added in recent Unicode releases sufficient to reach or exceed 3,900 by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nBased on the provided sources, here are the key points:\n\n- In 2022, 112 new emojis were released.\n- In 2023, only 31 new emojis were released.\n- In 2024, 118 new emojis were released, largely due to the inclusion of emojis with different skin colors and genders.\n- The latest release, Unicode 16.0, includes only 8 new emojis.\n\nAs of September 2024, the total number of emojis in the Unicode Standard is 3,790.\n\nGiven the recent trend, the addition of only 8 new emojis in the latest release (Unicode 16.0) does not suggest that the total number of emojis will exceed 3,900 by December 31, 2024. The total would be 3,798 (3,790 + 8), which is below the 3,900 threshold.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any indications that the Unicode Consortium is slowing down the rate of new emoji additions?\nANSWER: There are no clear indications that the Unicode Consortium is slowing down the rate of new emoji additions. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- The Unicode Consortium continues to receive and process a significant number of emoji proposals each year. For example, they receive around 100 proposals for new emojis annually.\n- The process for approving new emojis, including the involvement of various subcommittees and the technical committee, remains active and ongoing.\n- Recent updates, such as the release of Emoji 16.0 and the upcoming Emoji 17.0, indicate that the consortium is still actively adding new emojis to the standard.\n- There is no mention in the provided sources of any intention or action to slow down the rate of new emoji additions.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**NO**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of today's date, **November 1, 2024**, there are approximately **2 months** remaining until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and December 31, 2024, the total number of emojis would remain at the count established by the most recent Unicode release. As of the latest information available, the **total number of emojis is less than 3,900**—specifically, it is around **3,790 emojis** following the release of Unicode 16.0 in September 2024.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only **approximately two weeks** left until December 31, 2024, it is **highly unlikely** that any new Unicode releases or significant updates would occur in such a short timeframe. Therefore, I would forecast a **low probability** of the total emoji count reaching or exceeding 3,900.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were **8 months** remaining until December 31, 2024—that is, if the date were around March 2024—the situation might allow for another Unicode release before the end of the year. Given the potential for additional emoji additions, I would assign a **moderate probability** to the total emoji count reaching or exceeding 3,900 by December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Emoji Count:** As of Unicode 16.0, released in September 2024, the total number of emojis is approximately **3,790**. This includes all unique emoji characters and their variants.\n\n- **Historical Trend:** In recent years, the rate of new emoji additions has been **decreasing**. For example:\n  - Unicode 15.0 (2022) added **20 new emojis**.\n  - Unicode 15.1 (2023) added **118 new emojis**, many of which were variants and sequences rather than entirely new characters.\n  - Unicode 16.0 (2024) introduced only **8 new emojis**, representing the **smallest set** of new emojis in recent history.\n\n- **Release Schedule:** The Unicode Consortium typically releases new versions of the Unicode Standard **once per year**, usually around September. With Unicode 16.0 already released in September 2024, the next major release (Unicode 17.0) is not expected until **2025**.\n\n- **Potential for Interim Updates:** There is **no indication** of any interim updates or \"dot releases\" that would add a significant number of new emojis before December 31, 2024.\n\n- **Likelihood of Reaching 3,900 Emojis:**\n  - To reach 3,900 emojis, an addition of **approximately 110 new emojis** would be required.\n  - Given the recent trend and the small number of new emojis in Unicode 16.0, it is **unlikely** that such a substantial number of new emojis will be added in the next two months.\n\n- **Stakeholder Proposals:** There are **no major proposals** from stakeholders suggesting the imminent addition of a large number of new emojis that could tip the count over 3,900 before the end of 2024.\n\n- **Conclusion:** Considering the above factors, the probability of the total emoji count reaching or exceeding 3,900 by December 31, 2024, is **low**.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
