    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill there be a white Christmas in at least 4 of these 9 large European cities in 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThe 10 largest cities in Europe [according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_cities_by_population_within_city_limits#Largest_cities) are\n\n- Istanbul\n- Moscow\n- London\n- Saint Petersburg\n- Berlin\n- Madrid\n- Kyiv\n- Rome\n- Bucharest\n- Paris\n\nFor this question, we unfortunately have to exclude Kyiv due to the lack of standardised aerodrome weather reporting in the area.\n\nEach of the remaining 9 cities will have been considered to have had a white Christmas if, on either of the days 24 December or 25 December, there has been precipitation in the form of snow. The selection will be set to begin at hour 0 UTC on the 24th and end at hour 23 UTC on the 25th.\n\nIf four or more of them have had a white Christmas, then this question resolves as **Yes**. Otherwise, it resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nTo determine whether there has been precipitation in these cities, the [Ogimet METAR](http://www.ogimet.com/metars.phtml.en) historic data for the dates given above will be consulted. If that source is down, a similar one will be located. If none can be found with reasonable effort, the question resolves Ambiguous.\n\nThe lookup will be made  for the following airports (corresponding to the cities listed above, excluding Kyiv): LTFM, UUEE, EGLL, ULLI, EDDB, LEMD, LIRF, LROP, LFPG. Any reference to snow (SN), snow grains (SG), snow pellets (SP or GS), or snow shower (SW) will count as there being precipitation in the form of snow.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nMany children wish for a white Christmas, i.e. snow on the days 24th or 25th December. Transit operators and homeless people enjoy it less. It is an important cultural event around the northern Atlantic, though; hence this question!\n\nCultural note: The majority of inhabitants of Instanbul do not celebrate Christmas at all. Neither do all Russians celebrate Christmas in December. These differences are irrelevant for the question, which is focused on Christmas as celebrated by most cultures around the northern Atlantic.\n\n----\n\nThis question uses METAR data as the source for convenience, because it provides a standardised view into actual observed weather at diverse geographical locations. Here's an example of a METAR report:\n\n> METAR UUEE 050800Z 28003MPS 240V320 7000 -SN SCT006 M11/M13 Q1018 R24L/490336 R24C/490336 NOSIG=\n\nThe standard allows for many optional components, but common components are\n\n- The reporting station (in this case UUEE, which is a Moscow airport) comes after the preamble\n- the day and time of observation (in this case 050800Z meaning day 5 of the month, at 8 o'clock UTC)\n- wind speed and direction (in this case 28003MPS meaning 280°, 3 m/s)\n- visibility (in this case 7000 meaning 7000 metres)\n- cloud cover (in this case SCT006 meaning scattered at 600 feet)\n- temperature (in this case M11/M13 meaning temperature of -11 °C)\n- air pressure (in this case Q1018 meaning 1018 millibar)\n- runway information, starting with R\n- a near-term forecast (in this case NOSIG meaning no significant change expected)\n\nBut! Critically for this question, there are also indications of precipitation. In the example above, that's \"-SN\" for \"light snow\".\n\nHere are some other examples of reports indicating snow:\n\n> METAR ESSA 270120Z 01005KT 9999 -SN SCT007 BKN009 OVC046 M05/M06 Q1010 RESN BECMG BKN020=`\n\nRESN means \"recent snow\"\n\n> METAR ESNU 252220Z 33009KT 9999 SG FEW018 OVC055 M03/M05 Q1003=\n\nSG means \"snow grains\"\n\n> METAR EFOU 041820Z AUTO 14003KT 9999 -SHSN SCT044 M13/M15 Q1013=\n\n-SHSN means \"light snow shower\"\n\nFor decoding reports, [the web tool by Flight Plan Database](https://flightplandatabase.com/METAR) can be a helpful assistant.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of a white Christmas in at least 4 of the mentioned European cities, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Geographic and Climatic Factors\n- Cities located in the Alps or further north in Europe have a higher likelihood of a white Christmas. Places like Vienna, Austria; Munich, Germany; Chamonix, France; and Zermatt, Switzerland are situated in or near mountainous regions where snow is more common during December.\n\n## Specific City Conditions\n- **Vienna, Austria**: While Vienna can experience snow, it is not guaranteed. Snowfall is moderate, and the city does not always have a white Christmas.\n- **Munich, Germany**: Munich has a chance of snow, but it is not certain. The city experiences moderate snowfall, and a white Christmas is possible but not guaranteed.\n- **Chamonix, France**: Chamonix, being in the Alps, has a high likelihood of a white Christmas due to its elevation and location.\n- **Zermatt, Switzerland**: Zermatt, also in the Alps, is highly likely to have a white Christmas due to its high altitude and consistent snowfall.\n\n## Other Cities\n- **Krakow, Poland**: Krakow often experiences snow in December, making it a good candidate for a white Christmas.\n- **Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy**: This Italian town in the Dolomites is likely to have a white Christmas due to its high elevation and snowy winters.\n- **Vilnius, Lithuania**: Vilnius can experience snow in December, but it is less predictable compared to the Alpine regions.\n\n## General Trends\n- The higher the altitude and the further north the location, the more likely it is to have a white Christmas. Glacier ski resorts and high-altitude areas in the Alps are almost guaranteed to have snow.\n\nGiven these points:\n- Cities like Chamonix, Zermatt, and Cortina d’Ampezzo are highly likely to have a white Christmas.\n- Munich and Vienna have a moderate chance.\n- Krakow and Vilnius also have a chance, though it is less predictable.\n\nWhile it is difficult to predict with absolute certainty, the combination of these cities' geographic locations and typical winter weather patterns suggests that at least 4 of them could experience a white Christmas in 2024, especially those in the Alpine regions. However, this is not a guarantee and depends on specific weather conditions in December 2024.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do the airport METAR reports for these cities frequently include snow indicators (SN, SG, SP, GS, SW) on December 24th or 25th in past years?\nANSWER: The frequency of snow indicators in METAR reports for specific cities on December 24th or 25th cannot be determined from the provided sources. The sources explain the format and content of METAR reports, including how snow and other weather phenomena are reported, but they do not provide historical data or specific frequency information for any particular dates or locations.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether METAR reports for these cities frequently include snow indicators on December 24th or 25th is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any of these nine cities shown an increasing trend in December snowfall over the past few years?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no clear evidence to indicate an increasing trend in December snowfall for any specific cities over the past few years.\n\n- The analysis from the Pratt Institute focuses on winter precipitation trends from 1995-2020 but does not provide specific data for December snowfall trends in individual cities.\n- The Climate Central analysis discusses seasonal snow trends from 1970-2019, noting decreases in fall and spring snowfall and mixed trends in winter, but does not provide city-specific data for December.\n- The Reddit discussion and the Wunderground article do not offer detailed, city-specific trends for December snowfall over the recent years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as the sources do not provide the necessary specific data to determine if any of the nine cities have shown an increasing trend in December snowfall.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any meteorological evidence indicating that December 2024 will feature weather anomalies affecting winter conditions in Europe?\nANSWER: Yes, there is meteorological evidence indicating that December 2024 may feature weather anomalies affecting winter conditions in Europe.\n\nSeveral sources provide forecasts and analyses for the winter of 2024/2025, including December. Here are the key points:\n\n- The ECMWF and UKMO seasonal models forecast a warmer-than-normal winter for most of Europe, influenced by a high-pressure system extending from the Atlantic into mainland Europe. This is expected to push the jet stream further north, leading to warmer temperatures over much of the continent.\n\n- The precipitation forecast for Europe shows a drier signal over the west and southwest due to the high-pressure anomaly, while northern parts of the continent are expected to see more precipitation than normal.\n\n- The snowfall forecast indicates below-average snowfall for most of Europe, except for Scandinavia, which is expected to see more snowfall than normal due to the influence of a low-pressure system and the jet stream over northern Europe.\n\nThese forecasts suggest that December 2024 is likely to experience weather anomalies, including warmer temperatures and altered precipitation and snowfall patterns, which will affect winter conditions in Europe.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent changes in the jet stream patterns increased the probability of cold air reaching these European cities in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the impact of recent changes in the jet stream patterns on the probability of cold air reaching European cities in December 2024 is not clear-cut.\n\n- The sources indicate that La Niña is expected to emerge and persist through the winter of 2024-2025, which generally brings colder winters to Europe.\n- However, the specific effects of La Niña on European weather can be less predictable compared to North America. The jet stream patterns and pressure systems can vary, and the high-pressure system over Europe predicted by some models could lead to a warmer winter over much of the continent.\n- The jet stream is forecast to be pushed further north over Europe due to a high-pressure area, which might reduce the likelihood of cold air reaching many European cities.\n\nGiven these mixed signals, it is unclear whether the recent changes in the jet stream patterns have definitively increased the probability of cold air reaching European cities in December 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current climate models predicting colder than average temperatures in Europe for December 2024?\nANSWER: The predictions for winter 2024-2025 temperatures in Europe are not uniformly clear, and there are some contradictions between different models and analyses.\n\n- Some sources suggest that a La Niña event, which is expected to emerge and persist through the winter, typically brings colder winters to Europe. However, the impact can be variable and less predictable further away from the Pacific.\n- The ECMWF and UKMO models forecast a warmer winter than normal over much of Europe due to high-pressure anomalies, despite the expected La Niña event. These models indicate that the high-pressure system extending into Europe from the Atlantic would lead to warmer-than-normal temperatures.\n- Other analyses suggest that a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase could lead to colder temperatures in Europe, but the current ECMWF forecast does not indicate this scenario.\n\nGiven these mixed predictions, it is unclear whether current climate models are consistently predicting colder than average temperatures in Europe for December 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a significant likelihood of increased snowfall in Europe due to climatic events such as La Niña or the Arctic Oscillation in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the likelihood of increased snowfall in Europe due to climatic events such as La Niña or the Arctic Oscillation in December 2024 appears to be low for most of the continent.\n\n- Most sources indicate that Europe is expected to experience below-average snowfall during the winter of 2024/2025. For example,,, and all mention below-average snowfall predictions for most of Europe.\n- While La Niña is expected to influence the weather, its impact on Europe is less predictable and generally suggests milder conditions for much of the continent, with the exception of Scandinavia, which might see more snowfall than other European regions.\n- The Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) might bring occasional cold spells, but this does not translate to a significant increase in snowfall for the majority of Europe.\n\nTherefore, the overall consensus is that there is not a significant likelihood of increased snowfall in Europe as a whole due to these climatic events.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it statistically probable based on historical averages that at least four of these cities will experience snow precipitation on December 24th or 25th?\nANSWER: Based on the historical averages and the specific weather patterns described in the sources, it is unlikely that at least four of the cities mentioned (particularly those in North Carolina) would experience snow precipitation on December 24th or 25th as a statistical probability.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n- **Raleigh and Durham, North Carolina**: These cities are not typically known for significant snowfall in December. The sources indicate that snow is more common in higher-elevation areas, and even then, it is not a frequent occurrence.\n- **Mount Mitchell and other high-elevation areas**: While these areas can experience snow, the average first day with measurable snow is usually in November, and snow in late December is not the norm. The snowfall mentioned in the sources for December 2023 was an exception rather than the rule.\n\nGiven these points, it is **UNCLEAR** whether at least four specific cities would experience snow on December 24th or 25th based solely on historical averages, as the likelihood varies greatly depending on the location and elevation of the cities in question. However, for cities like Raleigh and Durham, it is highly unlikely, while for high-elevation areas, it is possible but not statistically probable as a regular occurrence.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are these cities located in areas where climate change is expected to lead to colder and snowier winters?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer to whether the cities mentioned (specifically Anchorage, Alaska, and other regions in the U.S.) are expected to have colder and snowier winters due to climate change is generally **NO** for most of the U.S., but there are some exceptions.\n\n### General Trends\n- Climate change is generally leading to warmer winters across the U.S., with winter being the fastest warming season. This results in less snowfall in many areas, especially in the fall and spring.\n- The overall trend in the U.S. is towards fewer snowy winters, with more precipitation falling as rain rather than snow.\n\n### Exceptions\n- Anchorage, Alaska, is an exception. It has experienced increased snowfall in recent years, attributed to warmer sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Alaska and stronger storms, which contribute to more snowfall in the region.\n- Some cold northern regions in the U.S. have shown mixed records, with some areas experiencing more snowfall during winter, but this is not a widespread trend across the country.\n\nIn summary, while Anchorage, Alaska, might see snowier winters due to specific regional factors, the broader trend across most of the U.S. is towards warmer and less snowy winters. Therefore, the general answer is **NO**, but with specific regional exceptions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are long-range weather forecasts suggesting higher than normal precipitation for these cities in December 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if long-range weather forecasts suggest higher than normal precipitation for specific cities in December 2024, we need to examine the forecasts provided for different regions.\n\n## General Forecast for the U.S.\n- A weak La Niña is expected to develop and persist through the winter months (December to February), which typically leads to warmer and drier conditions in the southern tier of the U.S. and wetter-than-average conditions in the northern tier, particularly in the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes region.\n\n## Specific Regions\n- **Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes:** These areas are expected to see above-normal precipitation during the winter months, including December.\n- **Southern Tier (e.g., Texas, Southern Plains):** This region is expected to be warmer and drier than normal, with below-normal precipitation.\n\n## City-Specific Forecasts\n- **Cities in the Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes:** These areas, such as cities in Washington, Michigan, and Ohio, can expect above-normal precipitation in December.\n- **Cities in Texas and the Southern Plains:** These areas are likely to experience below-normal precipitation in December.\n\nGiven this information:\n\n- For cities in the **Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes**, the answer is **YES**, as these regions are forecasted to have above-normal precipitation.\n- For cities in **Texas and the Southern Plains**, the answer is **NO**, as these regions are forecasted to have below-normal precipitation.\n\nTherefore, the answer depends on the specific city in question:\n\n- **YES** for cities in the Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes.\n- **NO** for cities in Texas and the Southern Plains.\n\nSince the question does not specify a particular city, the overall answer would be **UNCLEAR** without further context. However, based on regional forecasts:\n\n### For Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes cities: YES\n### For Texas and Southern Plains cities: NO\n### General answer without specific city: UNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there historical data indicating that at least four of Istanbul, Moscow, London, Saint Petersburg, Berlin, Madrid, Rome, Bucharest, and Paris have experienced snowfall on December 24th or 25th in the same year?\nANSWER: To determine if at least four of the listed cities (Istanbul, Moscow, London, Saint Petersburg, Berlin, Madrid, Rome, Bucharest, and Paris) have experienced snowfall on December 24th or 25th in the same year, we need to look at historical weather data for each city.\n\nWhile the provided sources do not offer specific historical snowfall data for December 24th or 25th for all these cities, here are some general observations and known facts:\n\n- **Moscow and Saint Petersburg**: These cities are known for their cold winters, and it is common for them to experience snowfall in December, including around Christmas.\n- **Berlin**: Berlin can experience snow in December, although it is not as frequent as in Moscow or Saint Petersburg. However, it is possible for Berlin to have snow around Christmas.\n- **London**: Snow in London is less common but can occur. There have been instances where London has seen snow around Christmas, though it is rare.\n- **Bucharest**: Bucharest can also experience snow in December, and it is not uncommon for the city to have snow around Christmas.\n- **Paris**: While Paris is less likely to have significant snowfall, it can still occur. However, snow around Christmas is relatively rare.\n\nGiven the general climate patterns:\n- Moscow and Saint Petersburg are highly likely to have snow on December 24th or 25th.\n- Berlin and Bucharest are possible but less frequent.\n- London and Paris are less likely but not impossible.\n\nHowever, without specific historical data for the exact dates (December 24th or 25th) in the same year for all these cities, we cannot definitively say that at least four of them have experienced snowfall on these exact dates in the same year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** based on the provided sources.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: Approximately 53 days remain until December 24-25, 2024.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed**: Based on historical climate data and without specific weather forecasts, it's likely that fewer than four of the nine cities will experience snow precipitation on those dates.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: With about 13 days remaining, extended-range weather forecasts would provide more accurate predictions. The probability might adjust slightly but likely remain similar.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left**: With around 212 days remaining, the forecast would rely heavily on historical averages and have greater uncertainty, but the probability estimate would be similar.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale**:\n\n- **Historical Snowfall Patterns**:\n  - **Moscow and Saint Petersburg**: These cities have a high likelihood of snow on December 24-25 due to their cold climates.\n  - **Berlin and Bucharest**: Moderate chance of snowfall; they occasionally experience snow during late December.\n  - **London and Paris**: Low but possible chance of snow; snowfall on Christmas is rare but not unheard of.\n  - **Istanbul, Madrid, and Rome**: Very low likelihood of snow on these dates due to milder climates.\n\n- **Statistical Probability**:\n  - Historically, it is uncommon for four or more of these cities to have snow simultaneously on December 24-25.\n  - Assuming Moscow and Saint Petersburg experience snow, at least two more cities would need to have snowfall, which is less probable.\n\n- **Climate Factors**:\n  - **Climate Change Trends**: General warming may reduce snowfall likelihood in some cities.\n  - **2024 Climate Predictions**: No specific anomalies (e.g., La Niña or Arctic Oscillation effects) are forecasted to significantly increase snowfall chances in these regions for December 2024.\n\n- **Uncertainties**:\n  - Weather patterns can be unpredictable, and rare cold snaps could increase snowfall in typically milder cities.\n  - Without current long-range forecasts for December 2024, there's inherent uncertainty.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nConsidering all factors, while there's a possibility that four cities could experience snowfall, it's not highly probable based on historical data and current climate trends.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
