    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the year-over-year increase in rent in Orlando, FL in November 2024 be greater than or equal to 1.0%, according to Zillow?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Zillow reports in its [Housing Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) resource page that its Observed Rent Index for Orlando, FL has risen by ≥1.0% for November 2024. If this does not occur, then this resolves as **No**. The figure can be accessed either through observing the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) chart or through the CSV file. To download the CSV, under RENTALS, make sure Data Type is set to \"ZORI (Smoothed): All Homes Plus Multifamily Time Series\" and Geography is set to \"Metro & U.S.\" The RegionName \"Orlando, FL\" in the CSV will be used, specifically by looking at the year-over-year increase from November 2023 to November 2024. (First divide current value by prior value, then subtract one, then multiply by 100%.)\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that the instructions on how to access the CSV are provided for convenience only; according to Zillow, \"We make frequent changes to the download paths for CSVs.\" In the event the location of the data has changed, the question resolves based on the new location. The question will resolve as soon as the data is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date and the data has been reported. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. In the event the chart and CSV report different figures, the CSV will take precedence.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Zillow, housing data is updated on the 12th of each month.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if the year-over-year increase in rent in Orlando, FL in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 1.0% according to Zillow, here are the relevant points:\n\n## Median Rent Change\nAs of August 2024, the median rent in Orlando, FL was $2,115, which is $63 less than the median rent in August 2023[3].\n\n## Current Median Rent\nThe median rent price in Orlando, FL for November 2024 is $2,025, which is $29 less than October 2024 and part of a broader trend of slight decreases[3].\n\n## Year-Over-Year Comparison\nGiven that the median rent in November 2023 was around $2,051 (based on the trend data provided), the year-over-year change from November 2023 to November 2024 would be a decrease of $26 ($2,051 - $2,025)[3].\n\n## Conclusion\nSince the median rent has decreased rather than increased, the year-over-year change in rent for November 2024 in Orlando, FL will not be greater than or equal to 1.0%. Instead, it will be a negative percentage change.\n\nTherefore, based on the information from Zillow, the answer to whether the year-over-year increase in rent in Orlando, FL in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 1.0% is **no**.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Zillow update its methodology for calculating the Observed Rent Index in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Zillow updated its methodology for calculating the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) in 2024. The methodology for ZORI, as described in the sources, was updated beginning in May 2020, and there is no mention of further updates in 2024[1][2][3]. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Zillow release the Observed Rent Index for Orlando, FL in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of Zillow releasing the Observed Rent Index (ZORI) for Orlando, FL in November 2024. The sources provide general information about rental trends and the methodology of the ZORI, but they do not specify the release of the index for Orlando in November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the median rent in Orlando, FL increase from November 2023 to November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the median rent in Orlando, FL did not increase from November 2023 to November 2024. Here are the relevant details:\n\n- According to Zumper, the median rent for all bedroom counts and property types in Orlando, FL has decreased by 5% in the last year[1].\n- Zillow also reports that the median rent price in Orlando, FL for November 2024 is $2,115, which is $63 less than the median rent in August 2023, indicating a year-over-year decline[3].\n\nTherefore, the median rent in Orlando, FL did not increase but instead decreased from November 2023 to November 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did inflation rates in Orlando, FL rise significantly in 2024, contributing to higher rents?\nANSWER: Yes, inflation rates in Florida, which includes Orlando, did rise significantly in 2024 and contributed to higher rents.\n\n- Florida's year-over-year inflation rate was reported to be around 3.99% to 3.91%, which is higher than the national average[3][4][5].\n- The rising inflation has significantly impacted the cost of living, including housing. The cost of rent has been particularly affected, with rent prices continuing to rise due to housing market shortages and increased demand driven by population growth[2][4][5].\n- Specifically, the inflation in Florida has led to higher costs for housing, with rent prices being a major concern for residents, including college students who are finding it harder to afford housing due to skyrocketing rent costs[2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the overall rent trend in Orlando, FL been increasing over the past year?\nANSWER: The overall rent trend in Orlando, FL has not been increasing over the past year. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- According to WESH, the median rent in greater Orlando decreased by 4% from $1,621 to $1,558 in 2024 compared to the previous year[2].\n- The Listing Rem notes that Orlando’s rent has decreased by -1.99% year over year and -.04% month over month as of 2024[4].\n- Zumper reports that rent prices for all bedroom counts and property types in Orlando, FL have decreased by 5% in the last year as of November 2024[5].\n\nThese sources consistently indicate a decline in rent prices over the past year. Therefore, the overall rent trend in Orlando has been decreasing.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Observed Rent Index for Orlando, FL in November 2024 at least 1.0% higher than in November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the information about the rent index in Orlando, FL for November 2024 compared to November 2023 can be derived as follows:\n\n- The median rent in Orlando, FL as of August 2024 was $2,115, which is $63 less than in August 2023[1].\n- For the specific month of November, the median rent in November 2024 is $2,025, which is $29 less than in October 2024. However, the year-over-year change is not explicitly stated for November[1].\n\nGiven the year-over-year decrease of $63 as of August 2024 and the lack of specific year-over-year data for November, we cannot definitively conclude that the rent index in November 2024 is at least 1.0% higher than in November 2023. Instead, the available data suggests a decrease in rent over the past year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there major new housing developments in Orlando, FL that increased rental demand in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there were major new housing developments in Orlando, FL in 2024 that could potentially increase demand for housing, including both for sale and rental markets.\n\n- Several new construction home communities and master-planned developments are underway in Orlando. For example, the EverBe community, which is a brand new master-planned development, is expected to have over 3,000 homes and various community amenities[2].\n- Other developments, such as those mentioned in the top 10 Orlando developments for 2024, include large-scale projects like the Packing District, which involves multifamily housing and other residential components[4].\n- The economic stability and growth in Orlando, along with builder incentives and future growth potential, suggest a vibrant real estate market that could attract more residents and potentially increase housing demand[3].\n\nWhile these sources primarily focus on new construction homes for sale, the overall increase in housing supply and the attractiveness of these new developments could also impact the rental market by drawing more people to the area.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the unemployment rate in Orlando, FL decrease in a way that could drive rent increases in 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if the unemployment rate in Orlando, FL decreased in a way that could drive rent increases in 2024, we need to analyze the trends in unemployment rates and their potential impact on the housing market.\n\n### Unemployment Rate Trends\n- The unemployment rate in Orlando, FL has been relatively stable and low throughout 2024. As of September 2024, the unemployment rate was 3.4%[3][5].\n- Comparing the rates, we see that the unemployment rate has fluctuated slightly but remains low: 3.4% in September, 3.6% in August, 3.7% in July, and 3.5% in June. In May, it was 2.9%, which is the lowest for the year[3].\n\n### Impact on Rent\n- A low and stable unemployment rate generally indicates a strong labor market, which can lead to increased demand for housing and potentially drive up rent prices.\n- The data shows that despite some minor fluctuations, the unemployment rate has remained below the long-term average of 5.38% and is lower than the U.S. rate of 3.9%[1][2].\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the low and stable unemployment rates in Orlando, FL throughout 2024, this could indeed contribute to a strong labor market and increased demand for housing, which in turn could drive rent increases.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there any major policy changes in Orlando, FL affecting rental prices in 2024?\nANSWER: There were several policy changes and developments that could impact rental prices in Orlando, FL, and broader Florida, although they may not be specific to Orlando alone:\n\n## Statewide Changes\n- As of July 1, 2024, more than 40 local ordinances across Florida, including those in Orange County where Orlando is located, became invalid and were replaced with a statewide law. This change ensures that local counties cannot enact rent control measures or other regulations that conflict with state statutes[2].\n- House Bill 133, which came into effect in mid-2023, allows landlords to accept a fee or monthly fees instead of a traditional security deposit. While this does not directly control rent prices, it can affect the upfront costs for tenants[2][5].\n\n## Rent Increase Regulations\n- Despite proposals, there are no rent increase limits in Florida. House Bill 31, which would have capped yearly rental increases at 30% for continuing residents, did not pass[2][3][4].\n- Florida maintains a preemptive ban on rent control, meaning local jurisdictions cannot introduce rent control measures[2][3][4].\n\n## Notice Requirements\n- While there are no specific laws dictating how much notice is required for a rent increase, landlords must follow notice periods for terminating leases (e.g., 60 days for a yearly lease)[3][4].\n\nThese changes and the absence of rent control measures continue to shape the rental market in Orlando and across Florida, influencing how rental prices are set and managed. However, the primary driver of rental price changes in 2024 is expected to be the significant increase in the supply of rental units due to new construction, rather than policy changes[1][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there significant economic growth indicators in Orlando, FL between November 2023 and November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there were significant economic growth indicators in Orlando, FL between November 2023 and November 2024, as evidenced by the following points:\n\n## Business Activity\n- Total sales in the Orlando region exceeded $169 billion in the first nine months of 2024, which is 4.3% more than the corresponding period in 2023, outpacing inflation[1].\n\n## Labor Market\n- The Orlando area saw an increase in private sector employment by 1.2% (+16,300 jobs) over the year in May 2024, and total nonagricultural employment increased by 19,200 jobs (+1.3%) since May 2023[3].\n- Despite a slight increase in unemployment rates, the labor market added 1,100 jobs in September 2024, bringing the total gains in the third quarter to 8,100 and 19,600 over the last year[1].\n\n## Industry Employment\n- The construction industry saw a significant turnaround, contributing the most jobs of any sector over the last 12 months and growing at the fastest pace year-over-year[1].\n- Other sectors like leisure and hospitality, and trade, transportation, and utilities also added substantial jobs during this period[3].\n\n## Real Estate and Tourism\n- Passenger volume through Orlando International Airport is expected to surpass 2023 levels, with a 4.9% increase through August 2024[1].\n- Although there was a relative softening in hotel occupancy, the average daily rate (ADR) for hotels rose in September 2024[1].\n\n## Economic Outlook\n- Consumer sentiment rose in each month of the third quarter, reflecting increasingly positive views on the nation’s economy, with sentiment hitting 78.3 in September, 12 percentage points higher than a year earlier[1].\n- The region's broadening workforce and growing industrial diversity are expected to maintain Orlando's position among the nation’s fastest-growing metro areas[2].\n\nThese indicators collectively suggest that Orlando experienced significant economic growth between November 2023 and November 2024.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n43 days (from November 25, 2024, to January 7, 2025).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends continue without any significant changes, the year-over-year increase in rent in Orlando, FL for November 2024 would **not** be greater than or equal to 1.0%. The data indicates a decreasing trend in median rents, suggesting that rents are likely to continue declining or remain stagnant.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only approximately 10 days left until the resolution date, the likelihood of significant changes affecting rent trends is minimal. Therefore, the forecast would lean even more strongly towards **No**, maintaining the expectation that the year-over-year rent increase will not meet the 1.0% threshold.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith an extended timeframe of about 172 days, there is more opportunity for economic shifts, policy changes, or unforeseen factors to influence rent prices. However, given the current data and trends indicating a decrease in median rents, the forecast would still favor **No**, although there is a slightly increased margin for potential changes compared to the short-term outlook.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe current data reveals a consistent trend of decreasing median rents in Orlando, FL, with specific figures showing a decline from November 2023 to November 2024. While factors such as low unemployment rates and economic growth could exert upward pressure on rents, the predominant influence of increased housing supply and existing downward trends in rent prices strongly suggest that rents are unlikely to increase by 1.0% or more on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, the lack of rent control measures and ongoing economic indicators support the expectation of stable or declining rent prices.\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
