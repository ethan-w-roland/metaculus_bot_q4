    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the year-over-year increase in prices of homes in Virginia Beach, VA in November 2024 be greater than or equal to 4.0%, according to Zillow?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-10\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Zillow reports in its [Housing Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) resource page that its Zillow Home Value Index, Raw  for Virginia Beach, VA has risen by ≥4.0% for November 2024. If this does not occur, then this resolves as **No**. The figure can be accessed either through observing the Zillow Zillow Home Value Index, Raw (ZHVI) chart or through the CSV file. To download the CSV, under HOME VALUES, make sure Data Type is set to \"ZHVI All Homes (SFR, Condo/Co-op) Time Series, Raw, Mid-Tier ($)\" and Geography is set to \"Metro & U.S.\" The RegionName \"Virginia Beach, VA\" in the CSV will be used, specifically by looking at the year-over-year increase from November 2023 to November 2024. (First divide current value by prior value, then subtract one, then multiply by 100%.)\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that the instructions on how to access the CSV are provided for convenience only; according to Zillow, \"We make frequent changes to the download paths for CSVs.\" In the event the location of the data has changed, the question resolves based on the new location. The question will resolve as soon as the data is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date and the data has been reported. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. In the event the chart and CSV report different figures, the CSV will take precedence.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Zillow, housing data is updated on the 12th of each month.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if the year-over-year increase in home prices in Virginia Beach, VA in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 4.0% according to Zillow, here are some key points from the available sources:\n\n## Current Trends and Forecasts\n- As of June 2024, the average home value in Virginia Beach was up by 5.4% over the past year, according to Zillow[1].\n- In May 2024, the median sale price in Virginia Beach showed a 7.8% increase compared to the previous year[4].\n- The forecast for the Virginia Beach housing market suggests a moderating trend, with a slight price increase expected in some periods and small dips in others. For example, a 0.2% price increase was expected by June 2024, and a small dip of 0.4% was anticipated by August 2024[4].\n\n## Recent Data\n- While the specific November 2024 data from Zillow is not provided in the sources, the overall trend indicates robust growth earlier in the year but a potential moderation in price increases as the year progresses.\n\n## General Market Conditions\n- The Virginia Beach housing market has been characterized by high demand and rising prices, but there are indications of a shift towards a more balanced market[2][4].\n\nGiven the information available, it is not possible to definitively state whether the year-over-year increase in November 2024 will be exactly greater than or equal to 4.0% based solely on the provided sources. The forecasts suggest a moderation in price growth, but the exact figure for November 2024 is not specified.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the year-over-year increase in home prices in Virginia Beach, VA in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 4.0% according to Zillow cannot be clearly determined as yes or no with the available data.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the median sale price in Virginia Beach, VA increase by 7.8% in May 2024 compared to May 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the median sale price in Virginia Beach, VA in May 2024 and the comparison to May 2023 can be found in the following source:\n\n- In May 2024, the median price in Virginia Beach was $399,000, which was an increase of 7.8% from the previous year[5].\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Zillow update its methodology for calculating the Home Value Index in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Zillow updated its methodology for calculating the Home Value Index (ZHVI) in 2024. The most recent methodology updates mentioned are from 2019 and the transition to using neural Zestimates starting in January 2023, but there is no mention of a 2024 update[3][5]. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average home value in Virginia Beach, VA higher in June 2024 compared to June 2023 according to Zillow?\nANSWER: Yes, the average home value in Virginia Beach, VA is higher in June 2024 compared to June 2023 according to Zillow.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the average home value in Virginia Beach is $406,933, which is up 5.4% over the past year[1][3]. This indicates an increase from the previous year.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the unemployment rate in Virginia Beach, VA lower in December 2024 compared to December 2023?\nANSWER: The available sources do not provide the unemployment rate for Virginia Beach, VA specifically for December 2024. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The unemployment rate for Virginia Beach in September 2024 was 2.90%[1].\n- The unemployment rates for December 2023 are provided, with Virginia Beach's rate not explicitly stated but implied to be low given the overall context[2][3].\n- There is no data in the sources for the unemployment rate in December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current inventory of homes for sale in Virginia Beach, VA lower in November 2024 compared to November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the current inventory of homes for sale in Virginia Beach, VA in November 2024 is not lower compared to November 2023; instead, it has increased.\n\nFrom the Rocket Homes report, it is stated that the number of homes for sale in Virginia Beach increased by 2.4% from October 2024 to November 2024, with 2,044 homes for sale in November 2024. Although this source does not provide a direct year-over-year comparison to November 2023, the overall trend indicates an increase in inventory rather than a decrease[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant new housing developments underway in Virginia Beach, VA in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are significant new housing developments underway in Virginia Beach, VA in 2024.\n\n- Vanguard Landing, a 128-bedroom community specifically designed for individuals with intellectual and developmental differences, is being developed with $31.85 million in financing secured through Berkadia and the Virginia Housing Development Authority[1].\n\n- The city of Virginia Beach saw a sharp increase in new housing units built in 2023, with 985 new units constructed, and this trend is indicative of ongoing development activity in the area[5].\n\n- Additionally, the city is considering long-term development plans for the Central Beach area, which include the addition of significant new housing units over the next 40 years, with proposals for 8,000 to 10,000 new housing units[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Zillow report a year-over-year increase in the Home Value Index for Virginia Beach, VA of at least 4.0% in November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the specific year-over-year increase in the Zillow Home Value Index for Virginia Beach, VA in November 2023 is not directly mentioned. However, the sources do provide data up to June 2024 and earlier in 2024, which show a year-over-year increase in home values.\n\n- Source [1] and [3] report a 5.4% year-over-year increase in home values as of June 30, 2024.\n- Source [5] mentions a 5.8% jump in home values as of January 31, 2024.\n\nSince the exact figure for November 2023 is not provided in these sources, we cannot definitively say whether the increase was at least 4.0% for that specific month.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Zillow forecasted a moderating trend in the Virginia Beach housing market for 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Zillow has forecasted a moderating trend in the Virginia Beach housing market for 2024.\n\n- Zillow anticipates a slight price increase of 0.2% in June 2024 and a small dip of 0.4% in August 2024, suggesting a plateauing of prices[1].\n- The forecast also includes a more significant price decrease of 1.9% projected for May 2025, indicating a potential shift towards a more balanced or buyer's market[1].\n- Additionally, Zillow's overall outlook suggests somewhat muted home value growth, with inventory increasing and demand recovering less rapidly, which favors a more moderate market trend[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have mortgage interest rates in Virginia Beach, VA increased in 2024 compared to 2023?\nANSWER: To determine if mortgage interest rates in Virginia Beach, VA have increased in 2024 compared to 2023, we need to compare the rates from both years.\n\n### 2023 Rates\nIn 2023, mortgage interest rates in the Virginia Beach and Hampton Roads area averaged between 7-8% throughout the second half of the year[3].\n\n### 2024 Rates\nAs of December 2024, the current mortgage rates in Virginia Beach are:\n- 6.532% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage[1],\n- 6.77% for a 30-year fixed mortgage in Virginia as a whole, which is likely similar to Virginia Beach[2].\n\n### Comparison\nGiven that the rates in 2023 averaged between 7-8% and the current rates in 2024 are around 6.5-6.77%, it appears that mortgage interest rates in Virginia Beach have actually decreased in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the overall inflation rate in Virginia, VA increased in 2024 compared to 2023?\nANSWER: To determine if the overall inflation rate in Virginia has increased in 2024 compared to 2023, we need to examine the inflation data provided in the sources.\n\n## Inflation Rates in 2023:\n- In July 2023, the national inflation rate was 3.3%, and it had been declining from the highs of June 2022[2].\n- By October 2023, the national inflation rate had further decreased to 3.2%[5].\n\n## Inflation Rates in 2024:\n- The cumulative inflation in Virginia since January 2021 was 21.3% as of April 2024, and 21.2% as of March 2024. However, these figures represent cumulative inflation and not the annual or monthly inflation rates for 2024 specifically[1][4].\n- The sources do not provide a direct comparison of the annual or monthly inflation rates for 2024 versus 2023. However, they do indicate that inflation has been moderating and that consumers expect continued moderation in inflation[2][3][5].\n\n## Consumer Sentiment and Expectations:\n- Consumer sentiment reports indicate that Virginians anticipate inflation to continue moderating, with short-term price expectations of 2.5% in the first quarter of 2024, down from 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2023[3].\n\nGiven the information, there is no direct data to show that the overall inflation rate in Virginia has increased in 2024 compared to 2023. Instead, the sources suggest that inflation has been moderating.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- **2 days** (Data expected to be updated by Zillow on December 12, 2024)\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- **YES** (Assuming current trends continue, the year-over-year increase in home prices would remain ≥4.0%)\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- **YES** (With only 0.5 months remaining, the current upward trend in home prices is likely to persist)\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- **YES** (Even with more time, the moderating trend suggests that the YoY increase would still meet or exceed 4.0%)\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of June 2024, the average home value in Virginia Beach, VA, showed a year-over-year increase of 5.4%, and the median sale price in May 2024 increased by 7.8%. While forecasts indicate a moderating trend in the housing market with slight price increases and potential small dips, the overall trajectory remains positive. Additionally, mortgage interest rates have decreased from 7-8% in 2023 to approximately 6.5-6.77% in 2024, which supports continued demand for homes.\n\nThe inventory of homes for sale has been increasing, which can exert downward pressure on price growth. However, the decrease in mortgage rates and sustained demand are likely to counterbalance this effect. Given that the data for November 2024 is expected shortly after December 10, 2024, and considering the current positive trend in home prices, it is reasonable to expect that the year-over-year increase in home prices will remain above the 4.0% threshold.\n\nEven when accounting for the moderating trend, the foundational factors such as decreased mortgage rates and historical performance up to mid-2024 support the likelihood of achieving or surpassing the 4.0% increase.\n\n**Probability: 75%**",
