    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Joe Biden sign 3 or more executive orders after Election Day and before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves **Yes** if the number of executive orders signed by President Joe Biden after November 5, 2024, and before January 1, 2025, is 3 or more according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) such as the [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders) and the White House's [Presidential Actions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/) portal.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nOnly official [executive orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order) count. Other actions such as memoranda, notices and proclamations do not.\r\n\r\nExecutive orders are counted according to the date they are signed; date published is immaterial.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order): \r\n\r\n>In the United States, an executive order is a directive by the president of the United States that manages operations of the federal government.The legal or constitutional basis for executive orders has multiple sources. Article Two of the United States Constitution gives presidents broad executive and enforcement authority to use their discretion to determine how to enforce the law or to otherwise manage the resources and staff of the executive branch. The ability to make such orders is also based on expressed or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the president some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation)\r\n\r\nIn his final months in office, Joe Biden has signed executive orders on [gun violence](https://baystatebanner.com/2024/10/02/biden-signs-executive-orders-on-gun-violence/) and [labor standards](https://natlawreview.com/article/president-biden-signs-executive-order-directing-agencies-prioritize-pro-union-and).\r\n\r\nSince becoming President, Biden has issued executive orders at the follow count per month:\r\n\r\n| Month            | 2021 | Month            | 2023 |\r\n|-------------------|------|------------------|------|\r\n| January 2021     | 25   | January 2023     | 0    |\r\n| February 2021    | 9    | February 2023    | 1    |\r\n| March 2021       | 3    | March 2023       | 2    |\r\n| April 2021       | 5    | April 2023       | 4    |\r\n| May 2021         | 5    | May 2023         | 2    |\r\n| June 2021        | 5    | June 2023        | 2    |\r\n| July 2021        | 1    | July 2023        | 3    |\r\n| August 2021      | 3    | August 2023      | 2    |\r\n| September 2021   | 9    | September 2023   | 3    |\r\n| October 2021     | 3    | October 2023     | 1    |\r\n| November 2021    | 4    | November 2023    | 1    |\r\n| December 2021    | 6    | December 2023    | 3    |\r\n\r\n| Month            | 2022 | Month            | 2024 |\r\n|-------------------|------|------------------|------|\r\n| January 2022     | 1    | January 2024     | 0    |\r\n| February 2022    | 3    | February 2024    | 3    |\r\n| March 2022       | 4    | March 2024       | 4    |\r\n| April 2022       | 3    | April 2024       | 1    |\r\n| May 2022         | 2    | May 2024         | 0    |\r\n| June 2022        | 1    | June 2024        | 1    |\r\n| July 2022        | 3    | July 2024        | 2    |\r\n| August 2022      | 2    | August 2024      | 0    |\r\n| September 2022   | 4    | September 2024   | 1    |\r\n| October 2022     | 4    | October 2024     | 0    |\r\n| November 2022    | 0    | November 2024    | 1    |\r\n| December 2022    | 2    | December 2024    | ?    |\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Joe Biden signing 3 or more executive orders after Election Day and before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context and Recent Activity\n- President Biden signed a significant number of executive orders in his first week in office, setting a record with 22 executive orders, but his rate of signing executive orders has varied over time[2][3].\n- Since dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, Biden's rate of signing executive orders has been notably lower. For example, he signed only two executive orders in the period following his announcement on July 21, 2024[3].\n\n## Current Trends\n- As of September 26, 2024, President Biden has signed a total of 143 executive orders during his presidency. However, the recent trend shows a slower pace, especially after his decision not to seek re-election[3][5].\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n- Past presidents have also shown varying rates of executive order signings, especially during election years. For instance, President Trump signed seven executive orders in August 2020, and President Obama signed five in August 2016. However, Biden's current rate is lower than his predecessors at this point in their presidencies[3].\n\n## Predictive Factors\n- The upcoming period between Election Day and January 1, 2025, is relatively short, and given Biden's recent slower pace, it might be less likely for him to sign a high number of executive orders in this timeframe.\n- However, the need for specific actions or responses to emerging issues could still prompt additional executive orders.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, presidents often use executive orders to address pressing issues or to implement policies when legislative avenues are challenging. Given the current political landscape and Biden's past behavior, it is plausible but not certain that he might sign a few more executive orders before the end of the year.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is possible that Joe Biden could sign 3 or more executive orders after Election Day and before January 1, 2025, the recent trend suggests a lower likelihood. However, this cannot be definitively answered as a yes or no without considering potential future events or policy needs that might necessitate additional executive actions.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major national emergencies or crises between November 5, 2024, and December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about major national emergencies or crises occurring between November 5, 2024, and December 6, 2024. The sources mention various emergencies and disasters, but none of them specify events within this exact timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden announced any planned executive orders to be signed after November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of any planned executive orders announced by Joe Biden to be signed after November 5, 2024. The sources list and discuss executive orders that have already been signed up to November 2024, but they do not mention any future planned executive orders beyond that date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the rate of executive order signings by Joe Biden increased in the final months of his presidency compared to earlier periods?\nANSWER: The rate of executive order signings by Joe Biden has not increased in the final months of his presidency compared to earlier periods. In fact, the data indicates the opposite:\n\n- Since dropping out of the 2024 presidential race, Biden has signed only two executive orders, which is a significantly lower rate compared to his earlier periods in office and also lower than his predecessors at similar points in their presidencies[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden expressed intentions to use executive orders to address specific policy areas in late 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nIn late 2024, Joe Biden has expressed intentions to use executive orders to address specific policy areas. For example, on September 26, 2024, President Biden and Vice President Harris announced a new Executive Order aimed at combating emerging firearms threats and improving school-based active shooter drills[1].\n\nAdditionally, Biden signed executive orders in September 2024, including one on investing in America and promoting good jobs, and another related to other policy areas such as labor agreements and educational equity[4]. These actions indicate his continued use of executive orders to address various policy areas.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant legislative gridlock in Congress that might prompt Joe Biden to issue executive orders?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe sources provide clear evidence of significant legislative gridlock in Congress, which could prompt President Joe Biden to issue executive orders to achieve his policy goals.\n\n- The current Congress is described as one of the most polarized and gridlocked in recent decades, with a low number of laws passed and an inability to legislate on key policy issues[1][4].\n- Bitter partisanship has left Congress gridlocked for over a decade, leading presidents to rely more heavily on executive powers to implement their policies[3].\n- The gridlock and polarization create an environment where bipartisan legislation is rare, and the president must use executive actions to advance their agenda[1][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Joe Biden sign any executive orders between July 21, 2024, and November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Joe Biden signed executive orders between July 21, 2024, and November 5, 2024.\n\n- On July 17, 2024, Biden signed an executive order \"on advancing educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity through Hispanic-serving institutions,\" just before his announcement to drop out of the 2024 re-election bid[2].\n- On July 25, 2024, he signed an executive order establishing an emergency board to investigate a dispute between New Jersey Transit Rail Operations and its locomotive engineers[2].\n- On November 21, 2024, Biden issued another executive order to establish a second emergency board for the same dispute between New Jersey Transit and its locomotive engineers[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any pending executive orders in Joe Biden’s administration as of December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: As of December 6, 2024, there are indications that there are pending executive orders or regulatory actions in Joe Biden’s administration.\n\n- A POLITICO article mentions that several significant regulatory actions are pending White House review, including changes to the independent dispute resolution process for surprise bills under the No Surprises Act, a proposal to advance how health data is shared (HTI-2), and cybersecurity updates to HIPAA. These actions have not yet been finalized or published[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have past presidents signed three or more executive orders within a similar time frame in their terms?\nANSWER: Yes, past presidents have signed three or more executive orders within a similar time frame in their terms.\n\nFor example, according to the sources:\n\n- President Donald Trump issued 4 executive orders in his first week[1].\n- President Barack Obama issued 5 executive orders in his first week[1].\n- President Bill Clinton issued 2 executive orders in his first week[1].\n- President George H.W. Bush issued 1 executive order in his first week, and President Jimmy Carter also issued 1 executive order in his first week[1].\n\nThese numbers indicate that several past presidents have signed more than one executive order, and some have signed three or more within their initial weeks in office. Specifically, President Joe Biden signed 22 executive orders in his first week, which far exceeds the number of any other president in the same time frame[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there increased public or political pressure on Joe Biden to take executive action before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThere is significant public and political pressure on Joe Biden to take executive action, particularly in the context of the southern U.S. border and other policy areas.\n\n1. **Border Security**: The articles highlight that Biden is under immense political pressure ahead of his re-election bid to address the high levels of border crossings. Critics from both the left and the right have been vocal about the need for more decisive action on the border, with some calling his recent executive actions an \"election-year ruse\"[1][5].\n\n2. **General Political Pressure**: The administration is also facing pressure to act on various other fronts, including immigration, climate action, and criminal justice reform, especially as the end of Biden's term approaches and in anticipation of a potential Trump presidency[3].\n\n3. **Election Considerations**: The timing of these executive actions, just before foreign trips and as the November elections approach, underscores the political pressures Biden is facing to demonstrate effective governance and alleviate some of the political criticisms[1][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any unresolved policy issues that typically require executive orders in Joe Biden’s agenda?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several unresolved policy issues in Joe Biden’s agenda that could typically require executive orders or other executive actions.\n\n## Immigration\nDespite Biden's initial plans to reform immigration laws and undo many of the restrictive policies of the Trump administration, many of these efforts have been stalled by the courts. Issues such as the Migrant Protection Protocols and Title 42 expulsions remain unresolved, and Biden could use executive orders to address these, such as fast-tracking citizenship applications, reversing executive orders restricting asylum, and expanding work permits for undocumented immigrants[1][2].\n\n## Executive Orders on Economy and Competition\nBiden has issued comprehensive executive orders aimed at promoting competition, raising wages, and weakening monopolies. However, the implementation of these orders is hindered by the lack of personnel in key agencies, which could be addressed through further executive actions to fill these vacancies[3].\n\n## Environmental and Energy Policies\nBiden could use executive orders to expedite the allocation and expenditure of funds from the Inflation Reduction Act for clean-energy initiatives, ban offshore drilling, and implement other environmental measures to prevent these funds from being impounded by the incoming administration[1].\n\n## Judicial Vacancies\nBiden's administration can work with Senate Democrats to fill federal judicial vacancies, which is another area where executive and legislative coordination is necessary[1].\n\n## Surveillance and Civil Liberties\nThere are also plans to implement changes that limit surveillance powers, such as a moratorium on the government buying personal data without a warrant, which could be achieved through executive orders[1].\n\nThese areas highlight the ongoing need for executive actions to address unresolved policy issues in Biden's agenda.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\nApproximately **25 days** remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\nIf current trends continue without any significant changes, it is **unlikely** that Joe Biden will sign 3 or more executive orders in the remaining 25 days. His recent rate of executive order signings has been low, and without additional factors prompting more actions, the number is expected to remain below three.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\nWith only about **6 days** left, the probability of signing 3 or more executive orders would decrease further. In such a short timeframe, coordinating and finalizing multiple executive orders becomes more challenging.\n**Forecast Probability:** **30%**\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\nIf there were approximately **100 days** left (4 times the current 25 days), there would be more opportunity to issue additional executive orders as needed. This extended period would allow for responses to emergent issues or policy initiatives that could drive the signing of more orders.\n**Forecast Probability:** **60%**\n\n**Rationale:**\nJoe Biden's historical rate of signing executive orders has varied, with a notably high number at the beginning of his presidency followed by a slowdown. In the final months, especially after deciding not to seek re-election, the pace has remained subdued. However, political pressure and unresolved policy issues may necessitate a few more executive actions. Given the limited time remaining (25 days), achieving three or more executive orders is plausible but not highly probable. If the timeframe were extended, the likelihood increases as there would be more opportunities to address pressing issues through executive actions.\n\n**Probability: 40%**",
