    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Joe Biden no longer be US President before January 1, 2025?\n\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Joe Biden does not complete his term as the 46th President of the United States from January 20, 2021 through January 1, 2025, as specified by the [20th Amendment]((https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-20/section-1)) of the US Constitution.  This may be for any reason, for example, due to his resignation, death, impeachment and removal, or another cause.\n\nThis question will not resolve if the Vice President or another person takes the duties of the Acting President as specified in [Sections 3 and 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_3:_President's_declaration_of_inability) of the 25th Amendment (for example, in the case of an [expected medical procedure](https://www.dw.com/en/us-kamala-harris-serves-as-acting-president-during-biden-colonoscopy/a-59883548)); it will only resolve as **Yes** if Biden is fully removed from the office.\n\nThis question will also resolve as **Yes** if the President's term is legally determined to end prior to midnight on January 1, 2025\n\nBACKGROUND:\n*Related Questions on Metaculus:*\n\n* [Will Biden be impeached by the US House of Representatives?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3419/biden-impeachment-vote-by-house-of-reps/)\n* [Will Kamala Harris be president before inauguration day 2025?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5201/will-kamala-harris-be-president-before-2025/)\n\n----\n\nRepublican Congresspeople [Ted Cruz](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/04/ted-cruz-joe-biden-impeachment/) and [Jim Jordan](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/mar/25/jim-jordan-prods-gop-colleagues-consider-impeachin/) have both publicly discussed the possibility of impeaching President Joe Biden if Republicans win control of the House of Representatives following the [2022 midterm elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections).  Ted Cruz stated on his podcast in [January 2022](https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/04/ted-cruz-joe-biden-impeachment/):\n\n>Democrats weaponized impeachment [...] they used it for partisan purposes to go after Trump because they disagreed with him. And one of the real disadvantages of doing that … is the more you weaponize it and turn it into a partisan cudgel, you know, what’s good for the goose is good for the gander.\n\nThroughout his term, Biden has maintained that his plan is to run for re-election, as confirmed by Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in [June 2022](https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1536477522988343296).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Joe Biden will no longer be the US President before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Status and Election Outcomes\nJoe Biden is the 46th President of the United States, having taken office on January 20, 2021. According to recent information, Biden has withdrawn his bid for a second term in the 2024 presidential election, and Donald Trump is projected to succeed him in January 2025 after winning the 2024 presidential election[1].\n\n## Transition and Succession\nSince Biden has already announced that he will not seek re-election and Trump has won the election, it is clear that Biden will step down as President by January 20, 2025, when the new president is inaugurated. This transition is part of the normal electoral process and does not involve any extraordinary circumstances such as resignation, impeachment, or incapacitation[1][2].\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven that Joe Biden will complete his term and step down on January 20, 2025, to make way for the newly elected president, it is certain that he will no longer be the US President by January 20, 2025. However, since the question specifically asks about January 1, 2025, it is clear that Biden will still be in office until his term ends on January 20, 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Joe Biden will no longer be US President before January 1, 2025, is **no**. He will remain in office until the end of his term.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US Senate convicted and removed Joe Biden from office following impeachment?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe sources indicate that while an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden was conducted and a report was released alleging \"impeachable conduct,\" no articles of impeachment were recommended, and there was no vote in the House to impeach him. Furthermore, there is no mention of the Senate taking any action to convict and remove Joe Biden from office[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden announced any intention to resign from the presidency before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nJoe Biden has announced that he is withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race and will not seek reelection, but he has made it clear that he will continue to serve as President for the remainder of his term. There is no indication in the sources that he intends to resign from the presidency before January 1, 2025[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden's eligibility to serve as President been legally challenged in the US Supreme Court?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any legal challenge to Joe Biden's eligibility to serve as President being heard or decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The sources discuss the Supreme Court's ruling on Biden's student loan debt cancellation program, but they do not address any challenges to his eligibility for the presidency.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as the sources do not provide any information on this specific topic.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden been impeached by the US House of Representatives?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nAs of the current information, there is no indication that Joe Biden has been impeached by the US House of Representatives. The sources detail various impeachment inquiries and resolutions introduced against him, but none of these have resulted in an actual impeachment vote by the House[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a scheduled or ongoing impeachment trial for Joe Biden before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of a scheduled or ongoing impeachment trial for Joe Biden before January 1, 2025. Here are the key points:\n\n- The impeachment inquiry has been ongoing, but by August 2024, House Republicans were acknowledged to be giving up on trying to impeach Joe Biden due to a lack of sufficient evidence and votes[4][5].\n- The report released by the GOP committees did not call for an impeachment vote, and leadership did not mention any next steps towards an impeachment vote[4].\n- It was stated that the investigation was largely over, with only a handful of legal battles remaining, but no impeachment trial was mentioned[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden experienced any life-threatening health events since taking office in 2021?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Joe Biden has experienced any life-threatening health events since taking office in 2021. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources detail his existing health conditions, such as obstructive sleep apnea, non-valvular atrial fibrillation, peripheral neuropathy, and spinal arthritis, but these are managed conditions rather than life-threatening events that have occurred since he took office[1][2][3].\n- The only recent health event mentioned is his COVID-19 diagnosis in July 2024, which was described as mild with symptoms such as a cough, runny nose, and general malaise, and not life-threatening[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Joe Biden transferred presidential powers to the Vice President under the 25th Amendment before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, Joe Biden has transferred presidential powers to the Vice President under the 25th Amendment in the past, although not specifically before January 1, 2025, in the context of the current discussions.\n\nHistorically, Joe Biden has invoked Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to temporarily transfer his powers to the Vice President during medical procedures. This occurred in 2021 when he underwent a medical treatment[2][3][5].\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about transfers before January 1, 2025, and the sources provided do not indicate any such transfers in the context of the 2024 election or recent events. Therefore, based on the information given, the answer to whether Joe Biden has transferred presidential powers to the Vice President under the 25th Amendment before January 1, 2025, specifically in the recent context, is:\n\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Joe Biden currently the incumbent US President as of November 21, 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nAs of November 21, 2024, Joe Biden is no longer running for reelection and has endorsed Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee. Although he has not resigned, his term as President will end with the inauguration of his successor on January 20, 2025. However, since the question is about whether he is the incumbent President as of the specified date, the answer is yes, he is still the incumbent President until the end of his term, but the context provided indicates he will not be beyond January 2025.\n\nTo correct the initial response based on the precise wording of the question:\n\nYES\n\nJoe Biden is still the incumbent US President as of November 21, 2024, although he has withdrawn from the 2024 presidential election and will serve out the remainder of his term until January 20, 2025[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any active investigations or scandals involving Joe Biden that could lead to his removal from office?\nANSWER: Yes, there are active investigations and allegations involving Joe Biden that could potentially lead to his removal from office.\n\n1. **House Oversight Committee Investigation**: The United States House Oversight Committee, along with the Ways and Means and Judiciary Committees, has been conducting an investigation into the Biden family's business dealings. This investigation includes allegations of influence peddling, abuse of office, and obstruction of the investigation. A report released in August 2024 by these committees alleged \"impeachable conduct\" by President Biden, although it did not recommend specific articles of impeachment[1][2][4].\n\n2. **Impeachment Inquiry**: In September 2023, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy directed the committee chairman, James Comer, to lead a formal three-committee impeachment inquiry into President Biden. This inquiry is ongoing and has produced a report detailing evidence of alleged impeachable offenses[1][2].\n\n3. **Allegations of Justice Department Interference**: There are allegations of interference by the Justice Department in the investigation into Hunter Biden's tax affairs and other legal issues, which some Republicans have characterized as a \"cover-up\" to protect the Bidens[1][3].\n\nThese ongoing investigations and the subsequent reports and allegations suggest that there are active efforts that could potentially lead to impeachment proceedings against President Biden.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any congressional action aimed at removing Joe Biden from the presidency before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, there has been congressional action aimed at removing Joe Biden from the presidency, although it has not yet resulted in his removal.\n\nOn June 13, 2023, Rep. Lauren Boebert introduced House Resolution 503 (H.Res. 503) to impeach President Joe Biden for high crimes and misdemeanors, specifically related to his handling of immigration and the southern border[1][2].\n\nThis resolution was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Homeland Security, and later to the Subcommittee on Border Security and Enforcement on August 23, 2023. However, it has not progressed beyond the committee stage[1][2].\n\nTherefore, while there has been an introduction of an impeachment resolution, no final action has been taken to remove President Biden from office.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\nApproximately 40 days remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\nIf nothing changes, Joe Biden will remain the US President until January 20, 2025. Therefore, as of January 1, 2025, he will still be in office.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\nWith only about 10 days left, the likelihood of any extraordinary event causing Biden to leave office becomes even slimmer. The probability remains extremely low.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\nHad there been approximately 160 days until January 1, 2025, there would have been more time for potential unforeseen events. However, given the stability of the current situation and lack of credible threats to Biden's presidency, the probability would still remain very low, albeit slightly higher than with only 40 days remaining.\n\n**Rationale:**\nAs of November 21, 2024, Joe Biden is serving his term as the 46th President of the United States, set to conclude on January 20, 2025. The normal transition of power occurs on Inauguration Day, and there are no credible indications or developments suggesting Biden will leave office before this date. While there are ongoing investigations and political tensions, none have reached a threshold that would likely result in Biden's removal from office before January 1, 2025. Historical precedents and the current political climate support the continuation of his presidency until the scheduled transition.\n\n**Probability: 1%**",
