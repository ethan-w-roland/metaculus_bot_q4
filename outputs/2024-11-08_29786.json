    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill 6 or 7 U.S. federal executive department heads be announced by the incoming administration between the election and December 16, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-08\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the total number of federal executive department heads officially announced as nominees by the new U.S. President-elect or their transition team after November 5, 2024, and before December 16, 2024, is 6-7 out of the total of 15 (listed in the Fine Print) according to credible sources. If a different number of nominees is announced, this question resolves as No.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- If a nominee is announced, it will count for resolution independently of potential retractions or refusals on the part of the nominee.\r\n- Reports that the new president-elect *will* announce an executive department head do not count for the resolution of this question if the announcement itself has not taken place.\r\n- Official announcements that the President-elect intends to retain an incumbent in their position will count for resolution.\r\n- Senate confirmation is not required for this question.\r\n- Only the following 15 [Cabinet positions](https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-executive-branch/) will affect resolution:\r\n    - Secretary of State\r\n    - Secretary of the Treasury\r\n    - Secretary of Defense\r\n    - Attorney General\r\n    - Secretary of the Interior\r\n    - Secretary of Agriculture\r\n    - Secretary of Commerce\r\n    - Secretary of Labor\r\n    - Secretary of Health and Human Services\r\n    - Secretary of Housing and Urban Development\r\n    - Secretary of Transportation\r\n    - Secretary of Energy\r\n    - Secretary of Education\r\n    - Secretary of Veterans Affairs\r\n    - Secretary of Homeland Security\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFollowing presidential elections in the U.S., new or re-elected presidents announce changes to [the cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States) as part of their transition or continued administration. The Cabinet has 26 members: the vice president, 15 federal executive department heads, and 10 Cabinet-level officials.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the department heads usually happen in the first 10 weeks following election day, but vary in terms of specific timing—from Nixon in 1968 who announced all positions in the six weeks following election day, to Biden in 2020 who announced the three final positions on January 7, 2021 (approximately nine weeks following election day).\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether 6 or 7 U.S. federal executive department heads will be announced by the incoming administration between the election and December 16, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Confirmation Process\nThe heads of the executive departments are nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the Senate. This process can be time-consuming, especially if the Senate is not in session or if there is significant opposition to the nominees.\n\n## Transition Period\nThe period between the election and the inauguration (typically in January) is a critical time for transition. During this time, the incoming administration often prepares and announces key nominations. However, the actual confirmation process may extend beyond the inauguration date, depending on the Senate's schedule and the complexity of the confirmation process.\n\n## Senate Control and Lame-Duck Session\nThe control of the Senate can significantly impact the speed and likelihood of confirmations. If the outgoing party controls the Senate during the lame-duck session, they may attempt to confirm certain nominees before the new administration takes over. However, if the incoming administration's party does not control the Senate, confirmations might be slower or more contentious.\n\n## Historical Precedents\nHistorically, incoming administrations often announce several key cabinet positions shortly after the election, but the confirmations may not be completed until after the inauguration. The number of announcements and confirmations can vary widely depending on the specific circumstances of the transition.\n\n## Current Context\nGiven the current context, if there is a change in the presidential administration, the new administration will likely announce several cabinet nominees before December 16, 2024. However, the exact number of announcements and confirmations completed by this date is uncertain and depends on various factors such as the Senate's schedule, the complexity of the nominations, and any potential opposition.\n\n### Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- **Base Rate**: Historically, incoming administrations often announce multiple cabinet nominees in the weeks following the election.\n- **Time to Resolution**: Confirmations typically take place after the inauguration, but announcements can happen sooner.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Previous transitions have shown that several key positions are usually announced before the end of the year, but confirmations may drag into the new year.\n\nGiven these considerations, while it is plausible that several executive department heads could be announced between the election and December 16, 2024, it is not clear whether exactly 6 or 7 will be announced and confirmed within this timeframe. The process is influenced by multiple factors, including Senate control, the speed of nominations, and the complexity of confirmations.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has a U.S. President-elect been declared following the November 5, 2024 election?\nANSWER: YES\n\nFollowing the November 5, 2024 election, Donald Trump has been declared the President-elect.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the media reported on potential nominees who may be announced before December 16, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information about media reports on potential nominees that may be announced before December 16, 2024. The sources discuss the 2024 presidential election, FEC reporting dates, the 2025 Grammy nominations, and a political appointee tracker, but none of them mention media reports on potential nominees for any specific date or period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major events or crises that could impact the announcement timeline of cabinet nominees in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no specific mentions of major events or crises that could directly impact the announcement timeline of cabinet nominees in 2024. The sources discuss various aspects of Donald Trump's second term, including policy expectations, potential cabinet nominations, and congressional dynamics, but they do not mention any particular events or crises that would delay or affect the timeline for announcing cabinet nominees.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the incoming administration expected to announce cabinet nominations promptly after the election?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe incoming administration of President-Elect Donald Trump is expected to announce cabinet nominations promptly after the election. Here are the relevant points from the sources:\n\n- Reports indicate that Trump is prioritizing the selection of leaders for pivotal departments such as State, Defense, and Treasury, with early announcements expected to focus on high-profile roles in national security and economic policy.\n- The transition process involves setting aggressive timelines for filling key White House, Cabinet, and sub-Cabinet positions, with a focus on making key appointments soon after the election.\n- Transition insiders suggest that Trump will begin assembling his cabinet immediately following his election victory, with a focus on signaling the administration’s immediate priorities.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant political or logistical obstacles that could delay cabinet announcements before December 16, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no specific mentions of significant political or logistical obstacles that could delay cabinet announcements in the context of the U.S. transition of power following the 2024 presidential election. The sources primarily discuss other topics such as Canada-U.S. relations, the German coalition collapse, and U.S. achievements in the global fight against corruption, without addressing the timing or potential delays of U.S. cabinet announcements.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** because the sources do not provide relevant information on this specific question.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it customary for incoming administrations to announce at least half of their cabinet nominees within six weeks after the election?\nANSWER: It is not customary for incoming administrations to announce all or even half of their cabinet nominees within six weeks after the election, although the process can vary.\n\n- Historically, the transition period involves a gradual announcement of cabinet nominees, often with key positions such as Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of the Treasury being announced earlier due to their critical roles in national security and economic policy[3|.\n- The process of selecting and announcing cabinet nominees can take several weeks to a few months, with the goal of having the most critical positions filled and ready for Senate confirmation hearings before the inauguration.\n\nTherefore, while some key nominations may be announced relatively quickly, it is not a standard practice to announce half of the cabinet nominees within six weeks.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous U.S. Presidents-elect announced 6 or more federal executive department head nominees between election day and December 16?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no explicit information provided about the specific number of federal executive department head nominees announced by U.S. Presidents-elect between Election Day and December 16 in previous administrations.\n\nThe sources discuss the general process of presidential transitions, the roles and responsibilities of the President-elect, and the timeline for electoral college procedures, but they do not provide detailed information on the number of nominees announced during this specific period.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether previous U.S. Presidents-elect have announced 6 or more federal executive department head nominees between Election Day and December 16 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the control of the Senate likely to influence the timing of cabinet nomination announcements during this transition?\nANSWER: The control of the Senate is likely to influence the timing and the process of cabinet nomination announcements during this transition.\n\nGiven that the Republicans are projected to take majority control of the Senate, this could affect how the president-elect approaches nominations. For instance, with a Republican majority, the president-elect may not need to cater as much to the moderate wings of both parties to get appointments through the Senate, as indicated by the oil lobbyist in the article.\n\nAdditionally, the stance of key Republican senators, such as Marco Rubio, Thom Tillis, and Bill Cassidy, suggests that while there may be some opposition to certain nominees, the overall environment could be more favorable for the president-elect's choices compared to a scenario where Democrats controlled the Senate.\n\nTherefore, the control of the Senate can indeed influence the timing and strategy behind cabinet nomination announcements.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the President-elect's transition team indicated preparedness to announce key cabinet positions soon?\nANSWER: The sources indicate that the President-elect's transition team is actively working on identifying and preparing to announce key cabinet positions, but they have not specified an exact timeline for these announcements.\n\n- The transition team is in the process of vetting a long list of potential Cabinet appointees, and there is a focus on identifying the people who will make up the president's Cabinet in the first weeks after the election.\n- While some names have been mentioned as potential candidates for various roles, such as Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff, the team is still in the process of considering and vetting other potential appointees.\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that the transition team is prepared and actively working towards announcing key cabinet positions, but the exact timing of these announcements is not specified.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the President-elect expressed intentions to retain any current federal executive department heads in their positions?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe provided sources do not mention any specific statements or intentions from a President-elect regarding the retention of current federal executive department heads. They discuss the general roles and responsibilities of the Executive Branch, the appointment and confirmation process, and the structure of the Senior Executive Service, but do not address the specific question of whether a President-elect has expressed intentions to retain current department heads.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\n- There are 38 days remaining until December 16, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\n- If no cabinet nominees are announced between now and December 16, 2024, the outcome would be **No**, since 6 or 7 department heads would not have been announced.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\n- With approximately 9.5 days remaining, the probability of 6 or 7 department heads being announced would be lower, as there would be less time for the announcements.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\n- With approximately 152 days remaining, the probability would be higher, as there would be more time for the administration to announce the nominees.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nHistorically, incoming U.S. administrations announce key cabinet positions soon after the election to ensure a smooth transition. Given that:\n\n- **President-elect Declared:** Donald Trump has been declared the President-elect following the November 5, 2024, election.\n\n- **Transition Team Preparedness:** The transition team is expected to announce key cabinet positions promptly. Reports indicate a focus on filling pivotal roles in national security and economic policy early in the transition period.\n\n- **Senate Control:** The President-elect's party has control of the Senate, which may encourage timely announcements due to a more favorable confirmation environment (even though Senate confirmation is not required for this question).\n\n- **Historical Precedence:** In previous transitions, such as in 2016 and 2008, presidents-elect announced a significant number of cabinet nominees between the election and mid-December. For example, by mid-December 2016, President-elect Trump had announced over half of his cabinet nominees.\n\n- **No Significant Obstacles:** There are no significant political or logistical obstacles currently known that might delay the announcements.\n\nGiven these factors, it is reasonable to expect that the incoming administration will announce between 6 and 7 executive department heads by December 16, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 80%**",
