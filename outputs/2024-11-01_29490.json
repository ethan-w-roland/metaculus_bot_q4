    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the US State Department approve more than 20 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves based on the total number of arms sales approvals by the US State Department listed at the Major Arms Sales [notifications page](https://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/archive-date/202410) by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency for October 2024, November 2024, and December 2024, when accessed by Metaculus on January 1, 2025.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNote that some State Department arms approvals are subject to congressional approval; however, this question only asks about arms sales listed at the resolution source as being approved by the State Department, even if later rejected by Congress.\n\nEvery listing will count as only one event, regardless of the number of types of equipment listed.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe United States is the largest arms exporter in the world, [accounting for](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/fs_2403_at_2023.pdf) 42% of global arms exports, with France and Russia tied for a distant 2nd, at 11%, and China in 4th place at 6%. In the past 5 years, State Department-approved arms sales per month have been as follows:\n\n| Month           | Number |\n|-----------------|--------|\n| October 2024    | 9      |\n| September 2024  | 12     |\n| August 2024     | 22     |\n| July 2024       | 4      |\n| June 2024       | 7      |\n| May 2024        | 10     |\n| April 2024      | 7      |\n| March 2024      | 10     |\n| February 2024   | 8      |\n| January 2024    | 7      |\n| December 2023   | 17     |\n| November 2023   | 5      |\n| October 2023    | 7      |\n| September 2023  | 7      |\n| August 2023     | 5      |\n| July 2023       | 4      |\n| June 2023       | 12     |\n| May 2023        | 7      |\n| April 2023      | 6      |\n| March 2023      | 10     |\n| February 2023   | 5      |\n| December 2022   | 6      |\n| November 2022   | 8      |\n| October 2022    | 3      |\n| September 2022  | 5      |\n| August 2022     | 7      |\n| July 2022       | 13     |\n| June 2022       | 3      |\n| May 2022        | 4      |\n| April 2022      | 6      |\n| March 2022      | 4      |\n| February 2022   | 9      |\n| January 2022    | 5      |\n| December 2021   | 5      |\n| November 2021   | 1      |\n| October 2021    | 1      |\n| September 2021  | 2      |\n| August 2021     | 8      |\n| July 2021       | 3      |\n| June 2021       | 4      |\n| May 2021        | 3      |\n| April 2021      | 4      |\n| March 2021      | 6      |\n| February 2021   | 5      |\n| December 2020   | 15     |\n| November 2020   | 6      |\n| October 2020    | 11     |\n| September 2020  | 9      |\n| August 2020     | 2      |\n| July 2020       | 15     |\n| June 2020       | 2      |\n| May 2020        | 7      |\n| April 2020      | 8      |\n| March 2020      | 4      |\n| February 2020   | 5      |\n| January 2020    | 2      |\n| December 2019   | 1      |\n| November 2019   | 5      |\n| October 2019    | 8      |\n| September 2019  | 5      |\n\nThe average per month is 6.7. The month of August 2024, with 22 sales, was the record highest since the monthly archive begin, in 2004.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the US State Department approving more than 20 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context and Volume of Sales\n- The US engages in a significant number of arms sales annually. For example, in Fiscal Year 2023, the total authorized value for Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) was $157.5 billion, and for Foreign Military Sales (FMS), it was $80.9 billion.\n- The State Department regularly approves multiple arms sales each quarter. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) frequently announces several major arms sales in a single update, indicating a high volume of transactions.\n\n## Notification and Approval Process\n- Under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), the President must formally notify Congress 30 calendar days before proceeding with major defense equipment sales valued at $14 million or more, defense articles or services valued at $50 million or more, or design and construction services valued at $200 million or more. For certain countries like NATO members, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel, or New Zealand, the notification period is 15 days.\n- This process suggests that multiple sales can be approved within a short period, given the relatively short notification times.\n\n## Transparency and Reporting\n- While public information on commercial arms sales (DCS) is less detailed than for FMS, it is clear that a substantial number of sales are approved each year. The lack of detailed public notifications for DCS does not necessarily indicate a lower volume of sales but rather a difference in transparency levels.\n\n## Base Rates\n- Given the historical data and the ongoing nature of US arms sales, it is reasonable to assume that the US State Department approves a significant number of arms sales each quarter.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the exact number of approvals for the fourth quarter of 2024 cannot be predicted with certainty, the historical context and the ongoing volume of arms sales suggest that approving more than 20 arms sales in a single quarter is plausible. However, the question cannot be answered definitively as yes or no without specific data for the fourth quarter of 2024. The base rates and the process outlined indicate a high likelihood, but confirmation would require actual data from that period.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major international defense contracts been announced for finalization in Q4 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about major international defense contracts announced for finalization in Q4 2024. The sources primarily discuss contracts and market activities within the U.S. defense sector, mergers and acquisitions, and general industry outlooks, but they do not provide details on international defense contracts for Q4 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do historical data show that Q4 typically has higher numbers of arms sales approvals than other quarters?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not offer specific quarterly breakdowns of arms sales approvals that would allow us to determine if Q4 (the fourth quarter) typically has higher numbers of arms sales approvals than other quarters.\n\nThe data presented in the sources are mostly annual or aggregated over several years, and they do not provide the detailed quarterly analysis needed to answer this question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent policy changes encouraging increased US arms exports in late 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no evidence to suggest recent policy changes encouraging increased US arms exports in late 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources discuss various proposed rules and legislation aimed at tightening controls and restrictions on arms exports, such as the proposed rules by the BIS and DDTC to enhance export controls and the interim final rule by the Department of Commerce to tighten restrictions on firearm exports.\n- There are also legislative efforts to reform the Arms Export Control Act to prioritize human rights considerations and to impose stricter conditions on arms sales, such as the SAFEGUARD Act and the Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act.\n- The context provided does not indicate any policy changes aimed at increasing US arms exports but rather focuses on strengthening regulations and controls.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US State Department approved more than 20 arms sales globally in any previous quarter?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the question about whether the US State Department has approved more than 20 arms sales globally in any previous quarter cannot be definitively answered from the information given.\n\nThe sources provide annual and fiscal year data on arms sales and exports, such as the total values of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) licenses, but they do not break down the data into quarterly figures or the number of individual sales.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US State Department shown a trend of increasing arms sales approvals in the months leading up to November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is evidence suggesting an increase in arms sales approvals, but it is not specifically tied to the months leading up to November 2024.\n\n- The U.S. State Department's summary for Fiscal Year 2023 indicates a significant increase in the total value of Foreign Military Sales, with a 55.9% increase from $51.9 billion in FY2022 to $80.9 billion in FY2023.\n- However, this data is aggregated for the entire fiscal year and does not provide a monthly breakdown or specific trends leading up to November 2024.\n\nTherefore, while there is an overall increase in arms sales approvals in FY2023, the sources do not provide enough detail to confirm a specific trend in the months immediately leading up to November 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant pending arms sales expected to be approved before the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several significant arms sales that have been notified to Congress and are in the process of approval, which could be finalized before the end of 2024.\n\n- On October 24, 2024, the Biden administration notified Congress of a potential sale to Saudi Arabia of $440 million for more than 1000 TOW 2A and TOW 2B missiles.\n- On October 11, 2024, notifications included sales to Saudi Arabia of $655 million for Hellfire II missiles, $251.8 million for AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder missiles, and $139 million for various ammunition.\n- In August 2024, a notification was made for a possible $650 million sale to Saudi Arabia for AIM-120C-7/C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) and LAU-128 Missile Rail Launchers.\n- In September 2024, a $500 million deal was notified for maintenance support services for various helicopters belonging to the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command.\n\nThese notifications indicate that these sales are in the process of being reviewed and could be approved before the end of 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the average monthly number of arms sales approvals increased in 2024 compared to previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the information regarding the average monthly number of arms sales approvals, particularly in the context of domestic or international arms sales, is not directly addressed.\n\nFor domestic gun sales, the source indicates that while there has been a significant number of gun sales in 2024, the average monthly sales have actually declined slightly compared to the previous year. From January to April 2024, an estimated 5,483,223 guns were sold, averaging about 1.3 million guns per month, which is slightly lower than the average of about 1.4 million guns per month during the same period in 2023.\n\nFor international arms sales, the sources do not provide a clear comparison of the average monthly approvals in 2024 versus previous years. They discuss significant arms agreements and deliveries but do not offer a monthly average for approvals.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the average monthly number of arms sales approvals has increased in 2024 compared to previous years is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any ongoing conflicts or tensions in 2024 that could increase international demand for US arms sales?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several ongoing conflicts and tensions in 2024 that could increase international demand for US arms sales.\n\n1. **Russia-Ukraine Conflict**: The ongoing war in Ukraine continues to escalate, with intensified military operations and the involvement of NATO countries in supporting Ukraine. This situation is likely to drive demand for military equipment and aid.\n\n2. **Israel-Hamas Conflict**: The conflict in Gaza and the potential for it to ignite a wider regional conflict involving other Palestinian territories and Islamist militant groups could lead to increased demand for arms from countries involved or supporting the parties in the conflict.\n\n3. **U.S.-China Tensions**: Rising tensions across the Taiwan Strait and in the South China Sea, along with the possibility of a severe cross-strait crisis, could prompt countries in the region to seek increased military capabilities, potentially including arms purchases from the U.S..\n\n4. **Middle East and North Africa Conflicts**: Ongoing conflicts in Syria, Sudan, and other regions, as well as the presence of various militant groups, are likely to maintain or increase demand for military equipment and arms.\n\n5. **North Korea’s Nuclear and Missile Programs**: The continued development and testing of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles by North Korea could lead to increased military spending and arms purchases by countries in the region, including potential buyers of U.S. arms.\n\nThese conflicts and tensions highlight a complex geopolitical landscape where the demand for military equipment and arms is likely to remain high or increase.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are any geopolitical events in 2024 leading the US to bolster allies through increased arms sales?\nANSWER: Yes, several geopolitical events in 2024 are leading the US to bolster its allies through increased arms sales.\n\n1. **Global Instability and Allied Demand**: The US Air Force is experiencing a significant increase in foreign military sales, driven by a growing sense of global instability. This has led to increased demand from U.S. allies to bolster their defense arsenals, particularly with purchases of F-35 and F-16 aircraft.\n\n2. **Conflict in Ukraine**: In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the US has renewed its plans for massive weapons transfers to Ukraine, contributing to the rise in arms sales.\n\n3. **Middle East Conflicts**: Following Hamas’ attacks in October 2023, the US has committed to expanded weapons deliveries in support of Israel, further increasing arms sales in the region.\n\nThese events highlight the US's efforts to strengthen its allies through increased arms sales in response to various geopolitical challenges.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any legal or congressional obstacles that might decrease arms sales approvals in Q4 2024?\nANSWER: There are several potential legal and congressional obstacles that could impact arms sales approvals in Q4 2024:\n\n## Congressional Review and Approval Processes\n- Current law under the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) allows Congress to adopt a joint resolution of disapproval to block an arms sale, although this has never been successfully done. However, Congress can still influence the timing and composition of arms sales through informal consultations and legislative actions.\n- Proposed legislation, such as the National Security Powers Act (NSPA) and the National Security Reforms and Accountability Act (NSRAA), aims to require affirmative congressional approval for certain arms sales, particularly those involving risky or destabilizing weapons. If these bills were to pass, they would introduce a new layer of congressional oversight that could slow or block certain arms sales.\n\n## Human Rights Considerations\n- The Safeguarding Human Rights in Arms Exports Act of 2023 and the Stop Arming Human Rights Abusers Act propose to prohibit arms sales to countries with gross human rights violations. If these bills are enacted, they would create significant obstacles for arms sales to certain countries.\n\n## Notification and Transparency Requirements\n- Existing and proposed legislation may increase the transparency and reporting requirements for arms sales, which could lead to more scrutiny and potential delays or blocks on sales. For example, the Safeguarding Human Rights in Arms Exports Act would clarify and strengthen human rights restrictions in the Leahy Law, applying them to all U.S. arms sales.\n\n## Legislative Actions\n- The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2024, while not currently including ambitious reform proposals, could still be amended to include measures that enhance congressional oversight of arms sales. Any such amendments could introduce new obstacles for arms sales approvals.\n\nGiven these potential changes and ongoing legislative efforts, there are indeed legal and congressional obstacles that could decrease arms sales approvals in Q4 2024.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time Left Until Outcome is Known:**\n\nAs of today's date, November 1, 2024, there are **two months** remaining until the outcome is determined on January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the Outcome Would Be If Nothing Changed:**\n\nCurrently, there have been **9 arms sales approvals** in October 2024. If no further approvals occur in November and December 2024, the total for the fourth quarter would remain at 9. Since this is less than 21, the question would resolve as **False**—the US State Department would not have approved more than 20 arms sales globally in Q4 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast If There Was Only a Quarter of the Time Left:**\n\nIf there were only **half a month** left until the outcome date, the likelihood of reaching more than 20 approvals would be low. With limited time, it's improbable that the number of approvals would more than double from 9 to over 20. Therefore, I would forecast a **low probability** of the question resolving as true.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast If There Was 4× the Time Left:**\n\nIf there were **eight months** remaining until January 1, 2025, there would be ample time for additional arms sales approvals. Considering historical averages and potential geopolitical factors, the probability of exceeding 20 approvals in Q4 2024 would increase. I would forecast a **higher probability** of the question resolving as true.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nTo estimate the probability that the US State Department will approve more than 20 arms sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2024, I have considered several factors:\n\n1. **Historical Data:**\n\n   - **Monthly Average:** The average number of arms sales approvals per month from September 2019 to October 2024 is approximately **6.7**.\n   - **Quarterly Totals:** Historically, quarters typically accumulate around **20 approvals** (6.7 approvals/month × 3 months ≈ 20).\n   - **Peak Instances:** August 2024 had an exceptionally high number of approvals at **22**, the highest on record since 2004.\n\n2. **Current Quarter Progress:**\n\n   - **October 2024:** There have been **9 approvals**, which is above the monthly average.\n   - **Pending Approvals:** Significant pending arms sales are expected to be approved before the end of 2024, including major deals with Saudi Arabia totaling over $1.5 billion.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Factors:**\n\n   - **Ongoing Conflicts:** \n     - **Russia-Ukraine Conflict:** Continues to drive demand for arms in Eastern Europe.\n     - **Israel-Hamas Conflict:** Recent escalations may lead to increased arms sales to allies in the Middle East.\n     - **US-China Tensions:** Heightened tensions could prompt increased arms sales to allies in the Asia-Pacific region.\n   - **Allied Support:** The US is likely to bolster allies through arms sales in response to global instability.\n\n4. **Policy and Legislative Environment:**\n\n   - **Potential Obstacles:** There are pending legislative efforts to increase oversight and potentially restrict arms sales, particularly concerning human rights considerations.\n   - **Historical Impact of Legislation:** While proposed laws could introduce obstacles, such measures have historically had limited immediate impact on arms sales approvals within a given quarter.\n\n5. **Seasonal Trends:**\n\n   - **End-of-Year Approvals:** There is anecdotal evidence that arms sales approvals can surge toward the end of the fiscal year or calendar year as agencies finalize deals.\n\n6. **Uncertainties:**\n\n   - **Lack of Clear Quarterly Trends:** It's unclear if Q4 typically sees higher approvals than other quarters.\n   - **Domestic Political Climate:** Domestic politics could either expedite or hinder approvals, but specific impacts are uncertain.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the above factors:\n\n- The current total of **9 approvals** in October 2024 is promising.\n- Historical averages suggest **approximately 20 approvals** per quarter.\n- Significant pending deals could substantially increase the total approvals.\n- Geopolitical tensions are likely to drive up demand and approvals.\n- Potential legislative obstacles present some risk but may not significantly impact the total within the quarter.\n\nBalancing these factors, there is a moderate to high probability that more than 20 arms sales will be approved in Q4 2024.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
