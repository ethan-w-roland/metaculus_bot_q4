    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Merck stock continuously remain below its all-time high before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-07\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Merck remains below $134.63 continuously through December 31, 2024. If the price ever exceeds that (including as an intraday high), this question resolves as **No**. Outcome verified through Yahoo Finance's [historical data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MRK/history/). \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIn case of forward or reverse stock splits, the price will be adjusted and resolved accordingly, based on comparison to the all-time high.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nReuters: [Harris vs Trump: Stocks to watch as White House race enters final stretch](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/harris-vs-trump-stocks-watch-white-house-race-enters-final-stretch-2024-11-01/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Merck stock will continuously remain below its all-time high before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Performance and Current Price\n- The all-time high for Merck stock was $132.10 on June 24, 2024. As of recent data, the stock price is significantly lower than this high, with a current price around $106.64.\n\n## Recent Trends\n- Merck's stock has declined by 14.4% over the past six months, underperforming both the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry and the S&P 500 Index. The stock is currently trading below its 200- and 50-day moving averages.\n\n## Earnings and Financials\n- The next earnings report is estimated to be between January 30, 2025, and February 3, 2025. Historical earnings releases have shown varied reactions in the stock price, but the upcoming report could potentially impact the stock's performance.\n\n## Key Products and Pipeline\n- Merck is heavily reliant on Keytruda, which accounts for around 50% of its pharmaceutical sales. While Keytruda continues to drive revenue growth, there are concerns about the company's dependence on this drug and the potential impact of its patent exclusivity ending in 2028.\n\n## Valuation\n- Merck's shares are currently trading at a forward price/earnings ratio of 11.69, which is lower than the industry average and its 5-year mean. This suggests that the stock might be considered relatively undervalued.\n\n## Dividends and Market Capitalization\n- Merck has a stable dividend yield of 2.86% and a large market capitalization of around $278 billion, indicating a solid financial foundation.\n\nGiven these points, while it is impossible to predict with certainty whether Merck's stock will remain below its all-time high before January 1, 2025, several factors suggest it could:\n\n- **Current Price and Trends**: The stock is currently well below its all-time high and has been underperforming in recent months.\n- **Earnings and Financials**: The upcoming earnings report could influence the stock price, but historical performance does not guarantee a significant immediate rise.\n- **Valuation**: Despite being relatively undervalued, the stock's performance is influenced by various market and company-specific factors.\n\nHowever, the question cannot be answered with a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" without speculation, as stock prices can fluctuate based on numerous unpredictable factors.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been significant insider buying of Merck stock in recent weeks?\nANSWER: NO,\n\nThere has been no significant insider buying of Merck stock in recent weeks. According to the sources, there have been no insider purchases of Merck stock in the last 90 days or the last year.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Merck's current stock price below $134.63 as of November 7, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Merck's current stock price is below $134.63 as of November 7, 2024. The current price of Merck & Co Inc (MRK) is $100.73, which is significantly lower than its 52-week high of $134.63.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming earnings reports for Merck before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: No, there are no upcoming earnings reports for Merck scheduled before January 1, 2025. The next earnings report for Merck is expected to be released on or around February 6, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have analysts recently upgraded their price targets for Merck stock to above $134.63?\nANSWER: No, analysts have not recently upgraded their price targets for Merck stock to above $134.63.\n\n- Recent reports indicate that several analysts have actually lowered their price targets for Merck. For example, Morgan Stanley lowered the price target to $123 from $130, and Guggenheim reduced it to $130 from $137.\n- The current average price target from various analysts is around $133.56, which is still below the 52-week high of $134.63.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Merck's stock price exceeded $134.63 at any time since June 24, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Merck's stock price has exceeded $134.63 since June 24, 2024.\n\n- The article from AAII mentions that during the month of June, Merck & Co Incâ€™s stock price reached a high of $134.63, but it does not provide information on prices after June 28, 2024.\n- The other sources do not provide specific daily or weekly stock price data for the period after June 24, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** because the available sources do not provide sufficient information to determine if the stock price exceeded $134.63 after June 24, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Merck recently received FDA approval for any new drugs?\nANSWER: Yes, Merck has recently received FDA approval for new drugs and treatment regimens.\n\n- On September 18, 2024, Merck's KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) was approved in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable advanced or metastatic malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).\n- On March 26, 2024, Merck's WINREVAIR (sotatercept-csrk) was approved for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group 1).\n- Additionally, other recent approvals include KEYTRUDA in combination with other chemotherapies for various cancers, such as biliary tract cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, though these approvals may not be as recent as the ones mentioned above.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Merck's stock price ever increased by more than 20% within a two-month period?\nANSWER: To determine if Merck's stock price has ever increased by more than 20% within a two-month period, we need to examine the historical performance data of Merck's stock.\n\nFrom the sources provided:\n\n- The historical performance data in the last 6 months does not show any two-month period with an increase of more than 20%.\n- The performance report on Barchart.com provides various time frames, but it does not specify any two-month period with a 20% or more increase.\n- The Nasdaq article discusses the overall performance of Merck's stock since 2021 but does not break down the performance into specific two-month periods.\n\nGiven the available data, there is no clear evidence to confirm that Merck's stock price has increased by more than 20% within a specific two-month period. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any scheduled industry conferences where Merck is presenting before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, there are scheduled industry conferences where Merck is presenting before January 1, 2025.\n\n- Merck is scheduled to present at several events, including the UBS Global Healthcare Conference, but the specific dates mentioned before January 1, 2025, include:\n  - October 31, 2024\n  - October 22, 2024\n  - September 18, 2024\n  - September 5, 2024\n  - July 30, 2024\n  - June 11, 2024\n  - June 3, 2024\n  - May 28, 2024\n  - May 15, 2024\n  - April 25, 2024\n  - March 12, 2024\n  - March 11, 2024\n  - March 5, 2024\n  - February 1, 2024\n  - January 8, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major macroeconomic events that could positively impact pharmaceutical stocks before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several factors and potential events that could influence pharmaceutical stocks, but it is unclear if there are specific major macroeconomic events that would positively impact pharmaceutical stocks before January 1, 2025.\n\nHere are some points to consider:\n\n- The sources discuss various challenges and headwinds facing the pharmaceutical industry, such as increased regulatory scrutiny, the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act, and geopolitical tensions. These factors are generally seen as negative or neutral rather than positive.\n\n- There is an expectation of continued deal activity and innovation in the sector, which could potentially drive growth, but this is more related to industry-specific strategies rather than macroeconomic events.\n\n- The study on the impact of major health events on pharmaceutical stocks suggests that such events can significantly influence stock performance, but these are health-related rather than macroeconomic events.\n\n- Macroeconomic indicators like GDP, inflation rates, and unemployment rates can influence stock prices, but the sources do not specify any upcoming macroeconomic events that would have a positive impact on pharmaceutical stocks before January 1, 2025.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Merck announced any significant clinical trial results expected before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, Merck has announced significant clinical trial results that are relevant and expected to be further analyzed or concluded before January 1, 2025.\n\n1. **mRNA-4157 and Pembrolizumab**: Merck and Moderna announced new 3-year data from the phase 2b KEYNOTE-942 clinical trial, showing sustained improvements in recurrence-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival for patients with high-risk stage III/IV melanoma. An additional year of follow-up is planned, which will be before January 1, 2025.\n\n2. **Vibostolimab and Pembrolizumab**: Although the phase 3 KeyVibe-010 trial was discontinued due to futility criteria, results from ongoing data analyses of this study will be shared with the scientific community and communicated to regulatory agencies, which is expected to happen before January 1, 2025.\n\n3. **Other Ongoing Trials**: Merck is involved in several other clinical trials, including a phase 3 trial evaluating mRNA-4157 combined with pembrolizumab in patients with resected high-risk melanoma, which is actively enrolling participants and will continue into 2025.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately **54 days** remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If nothing changes, and Merck's stock price remains below $134.63, the question would resolve as **Yes**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With about **13.5 days** left, I would forecast an even higher probability that the stock remains below its all-time high, as there's less time for a significant price increase.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** With approximately **216 days** until the outcome is known, there would be more opportunity for the stock price to rise, so I would forecast a slightly lower probability that it remains below the all-time high.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 7, 2024, Merck's stock price is **$100.73**, which is approximately **25%** below its all-time high of **$134.63**. For the stock to exceed its all-time high before January 1, 2025, it would need to increase by over **33%** in less than two months.\n\nSeveral factors suggest that such a significant increase is unlikely within the given time frame:\n\n- **Historical Performance:** Merck's stock has declined by **14.4%** over the past six months and is trading below both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating a bearish trend.\n\n- **Earnings Reports:** There are no scheduled earnings reports before January 1, 2025, which limits the potential for positive earnings surprises to boost the stock price.\n\n- **Analyst Price Targets:** Recent analyst revisions have **lowered** price targets for Merck, with the average target around **$133.56**, still below the all-time high.\n\n- **Lack of Major Catalysts:** There are no significant upcoming events, such as major clinical trial results or FDA approvals, expected before the end of the year that could dramatically increase investor optimism.\n\n- **Market Conditions:** The broader pharmaceutical industry is facing headwinds, and no major macroeconomic events are anticipated to positively impact the sector in the near term.\n\n- **Stock Volatility:** As a large-cap company with a market capitalization of approximately **$278 billion**, Merck's stock is less volatile and less likely to experience rapid price swings without substantial catalysts.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability that Merck's stock will remain below its all-time high before January 1, 2025, is high.\n\n**Probability: 95%**",
