    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill China's youth unemployment rate be greater than 17.0 and less than or equal to 18.0 for October 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-07\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve based on the youth unemployment rate for October 2024, as reported by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/youth-unemployment-rate), using data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\r\nThe question will resolve based on the reported youth unemployment rate, rounded to the nearest 0.1 percentage point.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe youth unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force aged 16-24 without work but available for and seeking employment, based on the calculation method used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China as of August 2024.\r\n\r\nIf the National Bureau of Statistics of China revises its calculation method or age range for the youth unemployment rate before September 2024, the question will be resolved using the most up-to-date definition and methodology.\r\n\r\nIn the event that Trading Economics does not report the youth unemployment rate for August 2024 before October 7, 2024, or if the data is not available from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the question will resolve as \"Annulled\". The data can be found [directly from the NBS here](https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=A01) by selecting \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate\" under \"Indicators\" on the left side and observing the data in the row labeled \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate of the Population Aged from 16 to 24 Excluding Students(%)\".\n\nBACKGROUND:\nChina's youth unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people aged 16 to 24 who are not in school and are unemployed, has been a growing concern for the country's policymakers and economists. In July 2024, the rate [soared to 17.1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/chinas-youth-unemployment-soars-above-17percent-in-july.html), the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December 2023.\r\n\r\nThe new calculation method, introduced in late 2023, excludes those who are still in school, as more people in China are pursuing higher education amid a more competitive job market. Under the previous calculation method, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023.\r\n\r\nThe rising youth unemployment rate has been attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes in the labor market. As the issue continues to draw attention, this question aims to predict the youth unemployment rate for August 2024, providing insight into the short-term trajectory of this critical economic indicator.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of China's youth unemployment rate being greater than 17.0 and less than or equal to 18.0 for October 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends\n- The youth unemployment rate in China was 17.6% in September 2024, down from 18.8% in August 2024.\n- This rate has been volatile, with a record high of 21.3% in June 2023 and a recent low of 13.2% in June 2024.\n\n## Economic Context\n- China's economy is experiencing a slowdown, which has impacted job opportunities, particularly in high-value service sectors such as real estate, finance, and IT.\n- Stringent hiring practices and the costs associated with terminating employees are also contributing to the high youth unemployment rate.\n\n## Methodological Changes\n- The National Bureau of Statistics has changed its methodology to exclude students from the unemployment calculations, which has affected the reported rates.\n\n## Projections\n- Trading Economics' global macro models and analysts' expectations suggest that the youth unemployment rate is projected to be around 20.0% by the end of the current quarter, although this is a broader projection and not specific to October.\n\nGiven these points, while the September rate was 17.6%, the trend and economic conditions suggest that the rate could remain high. However, predicting the exact range for October 2024 is challenging without specific data for that month.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The average youth unemployment rate from 2021 to 2024 has been around 16.68%, but recent months have seen significant fluctuations.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The data for October 2024 will be available in the near future, but current trends indicate ongoing economic challenges that could influence the youth unemployment rate.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The global economic context, including China's economic slowdown and specific sectoral declines, continues to impact job markets.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is plausible that the youth unemployment rate could fall within the specified range (greater than 17.0 and less than or equal to 18.0) for October 2024, given the recent trends and economic conditions, it is not possible to definitively answer the question as yes or no without the actual data for October. The answer is not immediately clear based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did reports from Trading Economics as of October 2023 forecast China's youth unemployment rate to remain high in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of forecasts from Trading Economics as of October 2023 regarding China's youth unemployment rate for 2024. The sources provide current and historical data, as well as forecasts made more recently, but they do not include forecasts made specifically in October 2023.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did sectors that typically employ young workers in China, such as technology or manufacturing, experience downturns as of October 2023?\nANSWER: As of the information available up to October 2023, sectors that typically employ young workers in China, such as technology and manufacturing, did experience significant challenges and downturns.\n\n- The technology sector, in particular, was affected by regulatory burdens that impeded growth, making it harder for young workers to find jobs in this industry.\n- The general economic downturn and the collapse of the property and housing market also led to a hiring slowdown, with jobs in sectors suitable for new labor market entrants being among the hardest hit.\n\nThese factors indicate that these sectors were indeed experiencing downturns and challenges in employing young workers.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the National Bureau of Statistics of China announce any plans to change the calculation method or age range for the youth unemployment rate after August 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, the National Bureau of Statistics of China announced plans to change the calculation method for the youth unemployment rate after August 2023.\n\n- The previous data series for the surveyed urban youth unemployment rate was halted in June 2023 due to a high proportion of students among the surveyed population, with the rate reaching a record high of 21.3% at that time.\n- In January 2024, the NBS started publishing data for a revamped version of the youth jobless rate, which excludes students, to more accurately reflect the size of the workforce.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there significant numbers of recent graduates entering the job market in China as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the significant influx of graduates entering the job market in China is primarily discussed in the context of 2024, not October 2023.\n\n- The sources mention that a record 11.7 to 11.8 million college students are set to graduate in 2024, which is the focus of the job market challenges described.\n\nThere is no specific mention of a significant number of recent graduates entering the job market in October 2023. Therefore, the answer to whether there were significant numbers of recent graduates entering the job market in China as of October 2023 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were analysts predicting continued high youth unemployment rates in China for 2024 as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, as of the period around June to September 2023, analysts were already expressing concerns and observations that suggested high youth unemployment rates in China would persist.\n\n- The youth unemployment rate had hit a record high of 21.3% in June 2023, prompting China to halt and then revise the publication of these figures.\n- Analysts noted that the economic slowdown, real estate downturn, and stringent hiring practices were contributing factors to the high youth unemployment rates.\n- The concerns about the large number of college graduates entering the job market and the challenges in finding suitable employment were also highlighted.\n\nWhile the specific predictions for October 2023 are not directly mentioned in the sources, the ongoing economic challenges and the analysts' comments suggest that they were indeed anticipating continued high youth unemployment rates in China.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 2023, was China's youth unemployment rate exhibiting an upward trend?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, the data on China's youth unemployment rate indicates that it had been increasing in the preceding months, but the specific trend for October 2023 itself is not directly provided in the sources.\n\n- In June 2023, the youth unemployment rate hit a record high of 21.3% before the data release was halted.\n- The data release resumed in December 2023 with a revised methodology, showing a rate of 14.9%.\n- However, by July and August 2024, the rate had increased again, to 17.1% and 18.8%, respectively.\n\nSince the sources do not provide specific data for October 2023, but indicate a halt in data release from July to November 2023, it is unclear what the exact trend was in October 2023.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there historical precedent for China's youth unemployment rate being between 17.0% and 18.0%?\nANSWER: Yes, there is historical precedent for China's youth unemployment rate being between 17.0% and 18.0%.\n\n- In July 2024, the youth unemployment rate in China was 17.1%, which is within the specified range.\n- The average youth unemployment rate in China from 2021 to 2024 has been around 16.68%, but it has fluctuated, with rates sometimes falling within or close to the 17.0% to 18.0% range. For example, in September 2024, the rate was 17.6%.\n- Historical data also shows that the youth unemployment rate has been high in recent years, with a record high of 21.3% in June 2023, but it has also been in the range of 17% to 18% during various periods.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Was the global economic outlook negative as of October 2023, potentially impacting China's youth unemployment in 2024?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, the global economic outlook was generally cautious and pointed to several challenges, which could have potential implications for various economic indicators, including unemployment.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- Global growth is forecast to slow down, from 3.5% in 2022 to 3.0% in 2023 and 2.9% in 2024, which is below the historical average.\n- Policy tightening to reduce inflation is expected to cool economic activity, and risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside.\n- China's property sector crisis could deepen, and the country's growth is forecast to slow, which could impact various economic sectors and potentially affect employment rates.\n\nWhile these sources do not specifically address China's youth unemployment in 2024, the overall negative economic outlook and the anticipated slowdown in China's growth could potentially impact employment rates, including those of the youth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there ongoing economic challenges in China as of October 2023 that could contribute to high youth unemployment in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there were ongoing economic challenges in China as of October 2023 that could contribute to high youth unemployment in 2024.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the following challenges:\n\n- **Declining Property Market**: The property sector, which is a significant component of China's economy, has been in a downturn, with many property developers defaulting and a need for stabilization of the property market.\n- **Debt and Financial Risks**: High levels of corporate and household debt, particularly in the real estate sector, pose significant risks to economic stability. Local governments are also grappling with high levels of debt, which could impact their ability to service their debts.\n- **Weak Consumption Growth**: Despite some recovery in consumption, there has been sluggish demand for durable goods and big-ticket items, and households appear hesitant to spend due to lack of confidence in the market outlook.\n- **Demographic Challenges**: China's labor force is shrinking, with the population in the 15–64 age range expected to decline about 1 percent annually by 2030. This demographic trend can contribute to labor market challenges, including youth unemployment.\n- **Global and External Challenges**: Tensions with the United States, complex global supply chain disruptions, and other external factors are adding to the economic pressures faced by China, which can impact employment opportunities.\n\nThese ongoing economic challenges as of October 2023 could indeed contribute to high youth unemployment in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Chinese government introduced policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment as of October 2023?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of October 2023, the Chinese government had introduced several policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment. Here are some examples:\n\n- A policy introduced in July 2023 encouraged employers to hire fresh college graduates and registered unemployed youth by offering a one-time allowance of 1,500 yuan ($207) for each young person hired.\n- The government launched a 100-day campaign starting in June 2023 to find jobs for college graduates and job seekers, and another campaign to provide employment policy introductions, career guidance, job recommendations, and skill training courses or internships.\n- In September 2023, as part of broader measures, the government continued to implement policies such as subsidized employment, skills development, and labor market policies to address youth unemployment.\n\nAdditionally, in September 2023 and beyond, the government issued a comprehensive 24-point plan to promote high-quality and full employment, which included measures such as aligning higher education programs with job market needs, investing in staff training, and prioritizing projects with strong job creation potential.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of November 7, 2024, the official youth unemployment rate for October 2024 is expected to be released soon, likely within the next few days to a week.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current economic conditions and recent trends continued without significant change, the youth unemployment rate might remain elevated but could show slight improvement due to government interventions. It is plausible that the rate would fall within the range greater than 17.0% and less than or equal to 18.0%.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith less time remaining, and assuming no major economic shifts, I would forecast a moderate probability that the youth unemployment rate would be within the specified range, considering gradual improvements or stabilization.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith more time before the outcome is determined, there would be increased uncertainty. Economic reforms or external factors could either improve the situation significantly or exacerbate unemployment. The probability of the rate falling within the specified range might decrease due to potential fluctuations.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nChina's youth unemployment rate has been a significant concern, reaching record highs in mid-2023, such as 21.3% in June 2023 under the previous calculation method. Contributing factors include economic slowdowns, challenges in key employment sectors like technology and real estate, and global economic uncertainties.\n\nIn response, the Chinese government implemented policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment:\n\n- **Employment Incentives:** Offering subsidies to employers who hire recent graduates and unemployed youth.\n- **Skill Development Programs:** Initiatives to enhance the employability of young job seekers through training.\n- **Economic Stimulus Measures:** Efforts to stabilize key sectors and stimulate job creation.\n\nBy October 2024, these measures may have started yielding results, potentially leading to a gradual decrease in the youth unemployment rate. However, structural issues and external economic pressures could limit the pace of improvement.\n\nConsidering the balance of these factors, there is a moderate likelihood that the youth unemployment rate for October 2024 is greater than 17.0% and less than or equal to 18.0%. The rate may have decreased from previous highs but could still remain within this range due to persistent economic challenges.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
