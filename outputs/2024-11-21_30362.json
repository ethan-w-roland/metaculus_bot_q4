    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Alphabet/Google continuously operate through January 1, 2025, without announcing Eric Schmidt's return as CEO or as a member of its Board of Directors?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **No** if before January 1, 2025, Eric Schmidt has been announced as the next CEO of Google or Alphabet, or is listed as being on its board of directors [here](https://abc.xyz/investor/board-and-governance/) or is announced as having been elected or appointed to the board. It also resolves as **No** if the company ceases operations. Otherwise this resolves as **Yes**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nInterim, acting, or temporary CEO does not count.\n\nIf the company has multiple CEOs and this individual is going to be one of them, it will count.\n\nThis question resolves based on announcement; the date of beginning work is irrelevant for purposes of this question. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nEric Schmidt served as CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011 and was its board chairman from 2011 to 2015 and then chairman of Alphabet from 2015 to 2017.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Alphabet/Google continuously operating through January 1, 2025, without announcing Eric Schmidt's return as CEO or as a member of its Board of Directors, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Leadership\nAs of the current date, Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Alphabet, and there is no indication from recent sources that he will be replaced by Eric Schmidt or anyone else in the immediate future. The market predictions on Manifold Markets suggest a low probability (around 9-12%) of Sundar Pichai ceasing to be CEO before the end of 2024[1].\n\n## Antitrust and Legal Issues\nAlphabet is currently involved in several antitrust battles, but these do not directly imply a change in leadership. Instead, they focus on the company's business practices and potential structural remedies, such as the sale of the Chrome browser or other products, which do not necessarily involve changes to the CEO or Board of Directors[2][4].\n\n## Business Operations and Strategy\nThe company is actively engaged in AI development, cloud services expansion, and other technological advancements. There is no mention of any plans to bring back Eric Schmidt, who has been involved in various advisory roles but is not currently part of the active leadership or Board of Directors[3][5].\n\n## Market and Internal Predictions\nThe market predictions and internal assessments do not indicate any significant likelihood of Eric Schmidt returning to a leadership role. The focus is on the current leadership's strategies and the company's ongoing operations and innovations.\n\nGiven these points, it is highly likely that Alphabet/Google will continue to operate through January 1, 2025, without announcing Eric Schmidt's return as CEO or as a member of its Board of Directors. However, since the future is inherently uncertain, this cannot be stated with absolute certainty, but the current evidence strongly supports this outcome.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Alphabet/Google made any announcements about changes in its CEO position since November 21, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any announcements regarding changes in Alphabet/Google's CEO position since November 21, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Eric Schmidt currently listed as a member of Alphabet's board of directors as of November 21, 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nEric Schmidt stepped down from the board of directors at Alphabet in June 2019 and did not seek reelection. Since then, he has held the role of a technical advisor, but he is no longer a member of the board of directors[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Alphabet/Google currently have multiple CEOs serving simultaneously?\nANSWER: No, Alphabet and Google do not currently have multiple CEOs serving simultaneously. As of December 3, 2019, Sundar Pichai became the CEO of both Google and Alphabet, replacing Larry Page and Sergey Brin in their respective roles[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Eric Schmidt publicly expressed interest in returning to a leadership role at Alphabet/Google since November 21, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Eric Schmidt has publicly expressed interest in returning to a leadership role at Alphabet/Google since November 21, 2024.

The sources discuss current and past members of the board, financial results, and other company activities, but do not include any information about Eric Schmidt being added to the board.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any current legal or financial issues that might lead Alphabet/Google to cease operations before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no indications that Alphabet/Google is at risk of ceasing operations before January 1, 2025. The sources discuss ongoing antitrust cases and potential remedies, including the possibility of Google being forced to sell off parts of its business, such as the Chrome browser, or other structural changes. However, these discussions do not suggest that the company would cease operations entirely[1][2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent resignations from Alphabet/Google's board of directors since November 21, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information about any resignations from Alphabet/Google's board of directors since November 21, 2024. The sources do mention past resignations and changes, such as Eric Schmidt's resignation in 2020, but they do not cover events after November 21, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Alphabet/Google currently operating without any bankruptcy or cessation proceedings?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Alphabet/Google is undergoing any bankruptcy or cessation proceedings. Here are the key points:\n\n- The financial reports for Q2 2024 and Q1 2024 show strong revenue growth, increased profitability, and robust financial health[1][2][3].\n- There is no mention of bankruptcy or cessation proceedings in any of the sources.\n- The company's financial strength, including its cash reserves, minimal reliance on debt, and strategic investments, suggests stability and continued operations[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Sundar Pichai expected to continue serving as CEO of Alphabet/Google through January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is a high probability indicated that Sundar Pichai is expected to continue serving as CEO of Alphabet/Google through January 1, 2025.\n\n- A market prediction on Manifold Markets suggests a 70% chance that Sundar Pichai will remain Alphabet CEO by the end of 2025, and only a 9% chance that he will cease to be CEO before the end of 2024[2].\n- There is no indication in the recent earnings call or other statements that suggest any imminent change in leadership[1][3].\n\nGiven this information, the answer is likely affirmative.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nFrom November 21, 2024, to January 1, 2025, there are **40 days** remaining.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf the current state remains unchanged, Alphabet/Google is expected to continue operating without announcing Eric Schmidt's return as CEO or as a member of its Board of Directors.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 10 days left, the likelihood of any significant changes in leadership or board composition is minimal. The probability that Alphabet/Google will continue without announcing Eric Schmidt's return remains very high.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith around 160 days, there's a greater window for potential changes. However, given Alphabet/Google's strong financial position, stable leadership under Sundar Pichai, and lack of indications of any planned changes involving Eric Schmidt, the probability of continuity without such an announcement remains high, though slightly lower than with the shorter time frame.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nBased on the current leadership stability, strong financial health, and absence of indications pointing towards Eric Schmidt's return to a leadership or board position, it is highly probable that Alphabet/Google will continue operating without such announcements by January 1, 2025. The company's ongoing focus on significant projects like AI development and cloud services further supports its continuous operation. Additionally, market predictions suggest a low likelihood of leadership changes in the near term. While a longer time frame introduces more uncertainty, the company's established position and lack of signals for such a transition maintain a high probability of continuity.\n\n**Probability: 90%**",
