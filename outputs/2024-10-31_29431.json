    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Kalshi be #1 in the free apps in the Apple App Store on November 5, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-31\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, on November 5, 2024, according to the Apple App Store at [this link](https://apps.apple.com/us/charts/iphone/top-free-apps/36), on or after November 4, 2024 Kalshi is ranked in #1 overall when accessed by Metaculus Admins. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. In case of the resolution source being down, Metaculus Admins will wait until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nOn October 28, 2024, the CEO of Kalshi [tweeted](https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1851102973738271088), \"Alright - this is getting crazy. \n\nRaise your hand if you want a market on who will be #1 in the entire App Store by Nov 5th?\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Kalshi being the #1 free app in the Apple App Store on November 5, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Popularity and Current Trends\n- Kalshi has seen a significant surge in popularity, particularly with the approach of the 2024 US presidential election. The platform has attracted $100 million in bets in a single month, indicating a high level of interest and engagement.\n\n## Regulation and Uniqueness\n- Kalshi is the only regulated American prediction market, which sets it apart from other apps and could contribute to its popularity due to its unique offering of legally trading on event outcomes, including the presidential election.\n\n## User Experience and Challenges\n- Despite its popularity, Kalshi faces challenges such as low liquidity and high fees, which have been highlighted by users. These issues could potentially impact its user base and overall ranking in the app store.\n\n## App Store Rankings\n- App Store rankings are influenced by a variety of factors including downloads, user engagement, and reviews. While Kalshi's current popularity is high, maintaining the #1 spot among free apps would require sustained user interest and positive feedback.\n\n## Time Frame\n- The question pertains to a specific date, November 5, 2024. The app's ranking can fluctuate rapidly based on various factors such as new app releases, changes in user behavior, and marketing efforts.\n\nGiven these points, it is not immediately clear whether Kalshi will be the #1 free app in the Apple App Store on November 5, 2024. The ranking depends on dynamic factors such as user engagement, new downloads, and the performance of other apps around that time.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, app store rankings are highly volatile and can change quickly.\n- The success of an app in maintaining a top ranking often depends on continuous updates, marketing, and user satisfaction.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The question is specific to a date just a few days after the current date, which means any prediction would need to account for short-term trends and any significant events or updates that might occur in the app or the broader app ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, while Kalshi has strong current momentum, predicting its exact ranking on a specific future date involves too many variables to provide a definitive yes or no answer.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple featured Kalshi in prominent positions within the App Store recently?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe provided sources do not contain any specific information about Apple featuring the Kalshi app in prominent positions within the App Store. The sources discuss general features and guidelines for the App Store, App Store Connect, and how apps can be featured, but they do not mention Kalshi specifically.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi ever been ranked #1 in the free apps category of the Apple App Store?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Kalshi has ever been ranked #1 in the free apps category of the Apple App Store. The sources list various top-ranked apps, but Kalshi is not mentioned among the top-ranked free apps in any of the lists provided.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Kalshi currently ranked within the top 5 free apps in the Apple App Store?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information that indicates Kalshi is currently ranked within the top 5 free apps in the Apple App Store. The sources describe the features and functionality of Kalshi, but they do not provide ranking information from the Apple App Store.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Kalshi experiencing a surge in downloads due to the 2024 US presidential election?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not explicitly mention a surge in downloads for Kalshi due to the 2024 US presidential election. While they do discuss the significant trading volume and interest in Kalshi's election prediction markets, there is no specific information about the number of downloads or an increase in downloads.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Kalshi investing in significant marketing or advertising campaigns targeting November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit information indicating that Kalshi is investing in significant marketing or advertising campaigns specifically targeting November 2024. The sources focus on the legal and regulatory aspects of Kalshi's event contracts, particularly the dispute with the CFTC and the self-certification of new contracts, but they do not mention marketing or advertising efforts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has a prediction market app ever reached #1 in the free apps category during previous US elections?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that a prediction market app has reached the #1 position in the free apps category during previous US elections. The sources discuss the features, usage, and popularity of various prediction market apps such as Polymarket, Robinhood, and Kalshi, but they do not provide rankings or historical data on app store positions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are any popular apps expected to launch or update on November 5, 2024, likely to occupy the top ranking?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about app launches or updates scheduled for November 5, 2024, that would indicate any new or updated apps are likely to occupy the top ranking on that date.\n\nThe sources discuss recent and ongoing trends, popular apps, and some soft launches, but they do not provide details about future launches or updates specifically scheduled for November 5, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Kalshi currently receiving predominantly positive user reviews and high average ratings in the App Store?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is unclear if Kalshi is currently receiving predominantly positive user reviews and high average ratings in the App Store.\n\nWhile some users have praised Kalshi for its user-friendly interface, educational materials, and the concept of event trading, others have expressed significant dissatisfaction due to issues such as low liquidity, high fees, and poor customer service.\n\nWithout access to the current overall rating or a comprehensive summary of all user reviews, it is difficult to determine the predominant sentiment or average rating. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Kalshi being promoted by major media outlets or influencers as of October 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Kalshi is being promoted by major media outlets and influencers as of October 31, 2024.\n\n- Kalshi has been featured in several major media outlets, including the New York Post, TechCrunch, and Fortune, which have reported on its election betting platform and its recent growth.\n- Additionally, Kalshi's election betting platform was promoted during live coverage of a Donald Trump rally on Right Side Broadcasting Network, a conservative media outlet.\n- The platform has also gained visibility through its legal victory against the CFTC, which has been widely reported in the media.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any legal or regulatory issues currently impacting Kalshi's ability to operate fully?\nANSWER: Yes, there are ongoing legal and regulatory issues impacting Kalshi's ability to operate fully.\n\n- Kalshi is involved in a legal battle with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over its offer of political event contracts, including those related to the presidential election, control of Congress, and specific Senate races. The CFTC has argued that these contracts constitute \"gaming\" or \"gambling\" and are contrary to the public interest, while Kalshi contends that they are compliant with the law and regulated.\n\n- Despite a favorable ruling from a federal appeals court on October 2, 2024, which allowed Kalshi to offer these contracts, the CFTC has appealed the decision and is seeking to expedite its appeal. The appeals court has denied the CFTC's emergency motion to stay the lower court's ruling, but the case is still pending, and the CFTC continues to argue that these contracts could undermine election integrity.\n\n- The ongoing legal proceedings and the CFTC's continued opposition mean that Kalshi's operations in this area are subject to potential future restrictions or changes based on the outcome of the appeal.",
    "comment": "(a) There are 5 days left until November 5, 2024.\n\n(b) If nothing changed, Kalshi would not be ranked #1 in the free apps in the Apple App Store on November 5, 2024.\n\n(c) If there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 1 day), I would forecast a slightly lower probability due to the reduced time for any significant changes.\n\n(d) If there was 4 times the time left (approximately 20 days), I would forecast a slightly higher probability, but it would remain low given the challenges involved.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**Current Rankings and Trends:**\n- **Lack of Current High Ranking:** There is no evidence that Kalshi is currently ranked within the top 5 free apps in the Apple App Store. Achieving the #1 spot within 5 days would require a significant and unprecedented surge in downloads.\n- **Historical Performance:** Kalshi has not previously reached the #1 position in the free apps category, suggesting that such a leap is unlikely without extraordinary circumstances.\n\n**Market Dynamics:**\n- **Competitive Landscape:** The top positions in the App Store are typically held by widely popular social media apps, games, and utility apps with massive user bases and significant marketing budgets.\n- **App Store Ranking Factors:** Rankings are influenced by download volume, user engagement, ratings, and reviews. Kalshi would need a substantial increase in all these areas to climb to the top spot.\n\n**Time Frame Considerations:**\n- **Limited Time for Change:** With only 5 days remaining, there is minimal time for Kalshi to implement strategies that could dramatically increase its ranking.\n- **Impact of Election Day:** While the US presidential election on November 5 could drive interest in election-related apps, it is uncertain if this interest would be sufficient to propel Kalshi to the #1 spot.\n\n**Marketing and Promotion:**\n- **No Significant Campaigns Noted:** There is no information indicating that Kalshi is launching major marketing or advertising campaigns targeting this specific time frame.\n- **Media Coverage:** Kalshi has received some media attention and promotion by influencers, which may increase visibility but is unlikely to result in a meteoric rise in rankings in such a short period.\n\n**Legal and Regulatory Challenges:**\n- **Ongoing Disputes with the CFTC:** The legal battles with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission could hinder Kalshi's operations and public perception, affecting user acquisition and retention.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the above factors, the probability of Kalshi being the #1 free app in the Apple App Store on November 5, 2024, is very low. While there is a slight chance due to potential spikes in interest around the election, the obstacles are significant.\n\n**Probability: 3%**",
