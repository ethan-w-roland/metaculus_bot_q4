According to [Iowa State University](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/), \"The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) collects environmental data from cooperating members with observing networks. The data are stored and made available on this website.\" \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the temperature in Phoenix, AZ will remain below 80 degrees F (approximately 26.7°C) for the entire month of December 2024, here are some key points from the available sources:\n\n## Historical and Average Temperatures\n- Daytime temperatures in Phoenix in December typically reach around 19°C (66°F) to 20°C (68°F)[2][3][5].\n- The average maximum temperature for December is usually around 19°C (66°F), with some days potentially reaching up to 22°C (72°F) or slightly higher[2][3].\n\n## Daily Temperature Ranges\n- The daily temperature ranges for December in Phoenix are generally between 11°C (52°F) and 20°C (68°F), with occasional warmer days but rarely exceeding 25°C (77°F)[3].\n\n## Extreme Temperature Records\n- While there are records of higher temperatures in past Decembers, such as a maximum record of 29°C (84°F) in 2010, these are exceptions rather than the norm[3].\n\n## Forecasted Conditions\n- The long-range forecast for December 2024 suggests mild to cool conditions with some periods of sunshine and occasional cooler spells, but it does not indicate temperatures consistently above 80°F (26.7°C)[4].\n\nGiven these points, it is highly unlikely that the temperature in Phoenix, AZ will exceed 80 degrees F (26.7°C) for the entire month of December 2024. The average and historical data suggest that temperatures will generally remain below this threshold.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the historical data and forecasts, the answer to whether the temperature will remain below 80 degrees F for the entire month of December 2024 is **likely yes**. However, it is important to note that weather can be unpredictable, and while it is highly unlikely, there is always a small chance of an unusual warm spell.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant heatwaves forecasted for Phoenix, AZ in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of heatwaves forecasted for Phoenix, AZ in December 2024.

According to NOAA, a slowly-developing La Niña event is anticipated to impact the weather across the country, including Arizona. This La Niña event is likely to result in a warmer and drier winter than normal in Arizona, although the correlation to below-normal precipitation is strongest for moderate to strong La Niña events, and there is still a chance of wetter than normal conditions[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are long-range weather forecasts predicting above-average temperatures for Phoenix, AZ in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the long-range weather forecasts do not indicate above-average temperatures for Phoenix, AZ in December 2024.\n\n- The forecast from Weather2Travel shows daytime temperatures usually reaching 19°C (66°F) and nighttime temperatures falling to 4°C (39°F), which are within normal ranges for December[1].\n- The Almanac.com forecast indicates temperatures for December 2024 as \"48° (avg.)\" which suggests average temperatures rather than above-average[2].\n- The World-Weather.info forecast also shows temperatures that are consistent with average December temperatures in Phoenix, with no indication of above-average temperatures[4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an El Niño event occurring in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it is clear that the El Niño event of 2023-2024 has already dissipated by the time we are considering December 2024.\n\n- The EarthSky article indicates that the El Niño event is expected to end by late spring or early summer 2024 and transition to neutral or possibly La Niña conditions by fall[1].\n- The NOAA Climate.gov update from June 2024 confirms that El Niño released its hold on the tropical Pacific in May 2024[4].\n- The November 2024 ENSO update also states that El Niño has dissipated and there is a likelihood of La Niña developing soon[5].\n\nTherefore, there is no El Niño event occurring in December 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average December temperature in Phoenix, AZ increasing compared to the past five years?\nANSWER: To determine if the average December temperature in Phoenix, AZ is increasing compared to the past five years, we need to examine the temperature trends over this specific period.\n\n1. **Historical Data**: The sources provided do not offer a direct comparison of average December temperatures over the last five years. However, they do provide historical temperature data and trends.\n\n2. **Temperature Trends**: The source from Weatherspark mentions that temperatures in Phoenix have been warming over the years, especially since the 1970s, but it does not specify the trend for the last five years[2].\n\n3. **Recent Weather History**: The 2024 weather history report does not provide a detailed comparison of December temperatures over the past five years. It focuses more on the overall weather history for 2024 rather than a specific month-by-month comparison[5].\n\nGiven the information available, there is no specific data to directly compare the average December temperatures in Phoenix over the last five years. Therefore, the answer to whether the average December temperature is increasing compared to the past five years is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has urban heat island effect in Phoenix, AZ been increasing in recent years?\nANSWER: Yes, the urban heat island effect in Phoenix, AZ has been increasing in recent years.\n\nSeveral sources indicate that the urban heat island effect in Phoenix is exacerbated by ongoing urbanization and climate change. Here are some key points:\n\n- The growth of Phoenix and the expansion into the desert valley have contributed to an increasing urban heat island effect, making nighttime temperatures 10 to 15 degrees warmer than in rural areas[3].\n- Studies by Climate Central show that the urban heat island effect in Phoenix amplifies temperatures by about 7.4 degrees on average, with some areas experiencing even higher temperature increases[1][2].\n- The urban heat island effect is intensified by the absorption and retention of heat by urban surfaces such as asphalt and concrete, and this effect is more pronounced in densely populated and built-up areas[1][2][4].\n- Recent data and trends indicate that Phoenix has warmed significantly more than other nearby communities, with the urban heat island effect accounting for a substantial portion of this warming, estimated to be around five degrees of the total 7.4-degree increase over the past 100 years[5].\n\nThese factors collectively suggest that the urban heat island effect in Phoenix has indeed been increasing in recent years.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent changes to the Phoenix, AZ climate monitoring infrastructure that could affect temperature reporting?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent changes and initiatives in Phoenix, AZ, that could impact climate monitoring and temperature reporting.\n\n1. **Advanced Heat Sensing Equipment**: The city is involved in advanced heat research and mitigation efforts, including the use of specialized monitoring equipment. For example, the Brookhaven National Laboratory's Center for Multiscale Applied Sensing is using a Ford F550 truck equipped with remote sensors, weather balloons, and other instruments to capture detailed data on heat waves and atmospheric conditions[3].\n\n2. **Southwest Integrated Field Laboratory (SW-IFL)**: This laboratory, involving scientists from multiple institutions, is working on next-generation predictive tools and resilient solutions for urban heat. This includes sensing heat through instrumentation, human experience, and simulations, which can enhance the accuracy and detail of temperature reporting[3].\n\n3. **Office of Heat Response and Mitigation**: This office, established by Mayor Kate Gallego, is focused on implementing solutions to mitigate the urban heat island effect. This includes various initiatives such as cool pavement programs, shade plans, and other heat mitigation strategies that could influence how temperatures are monitored and reported[4][5].\n\nThese advancements and initiatives suggest that the infrastructure for monitoring and reporting temperatures in Phoenix is being enhanced and refined.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n  \nThere are **35 days** left until the outcome is known, from November 26, 2024, to December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n  \nIf current conditions and historical climate patterns remain consistent, Phoenix, AZ typically experiences December high temperatures averaging between **66°F to 68°F**, with occasional days reaching up to **77°F**. Under these unchanged conditions, it is highly likely that daily high temperatures will remain below **80°F** throughout December 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n  \nWith approximately **9 days** left until December 31, 2024, forecasts would rely heavily on short-term weather patterns. If the upcoming week forecasts indicate stable temperatures within the historical range, the probability of all remaining days staying below **80°F** remains high. However, the limited timeframe reduces the ability to account for potential anomalous weather events, slightly decreasing confidence.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n  \nConsidering a timeframe of around **140 days**, encompassing multiple months leading up to December, broader climate trends and potential variations could influence December temperatures. Despite this extended period, December in Phoenix historically remains cooler, so the forecast would still favor temperatures mostly staying below **80°F**, albeit with increased uncertainty due to the longer projection period.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nPhoenix, AZ typically enjoys mild December temperatures, with historical data showing average high temperatures well below the **80°F** threshold. While climate change has introduced trends of increasing temperatures, December remains one of the cooler months in Phoenix's climate calendar. The recent high of **84°F** in December 2023 indicates that exceeding **80°F** is possible but remains an outlier rather than the norm. Additionally, current long-range forecasts for December 2024 suggest mild to cool conditions without significant heatwaves. However, factors like ongoing drought conditions and the intensifying urban heat island effect could marginally elevate temperatures. Given the balance of historical stability and gradual warming trends, the likelihood of all December days staying below **80°F** is high, though not absolute.\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
