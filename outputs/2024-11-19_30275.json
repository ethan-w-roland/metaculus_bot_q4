    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Kalshi outrank Robinhood in the top free Finance apps on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, on December 31, 2024, according to the Apple App Store at [this link](https://apps.apple.com/us/charts/iphone/finance-apps/6015?chart=top-free), Kalshi has a higher rank than Robinhood when accessed by Metaculus Admins. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. In case of the resolution source being down, Metaculus Admins will wait until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThis question represents an unfolding of events in which Kalshi continues building on its momentum, as surpassing the Robinhood app (currently ranked #22) would be considered quite a feat for a prediction market app.  On October 11, 2024, the CEO of Kalshi [tweeted](https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1844770826446319930) that Kalshi's app had surpassed Coinbase in the rankings, in the wake of Kalshi enabling betting on the US election.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Kalshi will outrank Robinhood in the top free Finance apps on December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Popularity and User Base\n- Kalshi has recently surged in downloads, overtaking brands like Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo, indicating strong user interest and growth[1].\n- Robinhood, however, is a well-established and popular investment app with a large existing user base, although its entry into the prediction market space is relatively new[1][2].\n\n## Specialization and Features\n- Kalshi specializes in prediction markets, offering a wide range of event contracts, including elections, and is fully regulated by the CFTC. It provides features like no fees on election contracts, the ability to buy and sell positions, and interest on long-term positions[1].\n- Robinhood, while a dominant player in traditional investments, has only recently entered the prediction market space with a limited offering focused on the presidential election. It charges a 1% fee on each election contract and does not allow for cashing out until the president is officially certified[1].\n\n## Market Dynamics\n- The competition between Kalshi and Robinhood in the prediction market space is new, with Robinhood's entry happening just before the 2024 presidential election. This timing might affect its immediate impact on app rankings[1].\n\n## App Store Rankings\n- App Store rankings can be volatile and influenced by various factors including marketing campaigns, user reviews, and new feature releases. As of now, Kalshi has shown significant growth, but Robinhood's established brand could still influence its ranking[1].\n\nGiven these points, it is not immediately clear whether Kalshi will outrank Robinhood in the top free Finance apps by December 31, 2024. The outcome depends on several factors such as user adoption, marketing efforts, and any new features or changes either platform might introduce.\n\n### Reference Classes and Base Rates\n- Historical data on app store rankings and user adoption rates for new features could provide some insights, but specific data on these apps' performance in the prediction market segment is limited.\n- The community prediction on a similar question about Kalshi outranking Coinbase is around 35.2%, indicating some uncertainty in Kalshi's ability to maintain or gain top rankings against established finance apps[3].\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The question resolves on December 31, 2024, giving both platforms several weeks to influence their rankings through user engagement, marketing, and feature updates.\n\nIn summary, while Kalshi has shown strong growth and specialization in prediction markets, Robinhood's established user base and brand recognition make the outcome uncertain. Further analysis of user trends, marketing efforts, and any new developments would be necessary to make a more informed prediction.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi received any major awards or recognitions in the finance app category this year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of Kalshi receiving any major awards or recognitions in the finance app category for the current year. The sources focus on the platform's operations, regulatory approvals, and the types of markets it offers, but do not include information about awards or recognitions.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Robinhood expanded its prediction market offerings beyond the 2024 presidential election since September 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Robinhood has expanded its prediction market offerings beyond the 2024 presidential election since September 2024. The sources only mention the launch of presidential election event contracts for the 2024 election, without any mention of additional prediction market offerings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi's app been ranked in the top 30 free Finance apps on the Apple App Store in the past month?\nANSWER: Yes, Kalshi's app has been ranked in the top positions of the Apple App Store's free Finance apps category in the past month. Specifically, it reached the number one position in the 'Finance' category on November 5, 2024[3][5]. This indicates that it has not only been in the top 30 but has actually topped the category.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Robinhood's app maintained a top 25 ranking in the free Finance apps category on the Apple App Store over the past three months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, as of November 9, 2024, Robinhood's app is ranked 8th in the free Finance apps category on the Apple App Store[3].\n\nGiven that this ranking is within the top 25 and there is no indication of a significant drop below this ranking in the recent past, it can be inferred that Robinhood's app has maintained a top 25 ranking over the past three months.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Robinhood introduced any significant new features or updates to its app in the last six months?\nANSWER: Yes, Robinhood has introduced significant new features and updates to its app in the last six months.\n\n- Robinhood has rolled out a new app experience that includes a customizable dashboard with widgets, allowing users to rearrange, add, and remove widgets to display the information that matters most to them. This update also includes new portfolio and search tabs, and an account tab for managing account details[4].\n- Additionally, there have been mentions of other new features and updates for 2024 and beyond, including various enhancements and new tools for users[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi secured additional funding or investment to support its growth in the past year?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nIn the past year, Kalshi has secured significant additional funding and investment to support its growth. Here are some key points:\n\n- Kalshi has received tens of millions of dollars in short-term loans from investors, including VC firm Neo and its founder Ali Partovi, to sustain its growth ahead of the U.S. election[1].\n- The company is also in discussions with new and existing investors to raise a formal equity round of as much as $50 million, with the possibility of raising more[1].\n- As of October 2024, Kalshi had raised a total of $106 million in equity capital and was valued at $787 million[1].\n\nThese funding efforts are aimed at supporting Kalshi's rapid growth, particularly driven by the surge in demand for betting on the U.S. election outcomes.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Robinhood's user base decreased due to negative publicity or service issues in the last six months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of the user base decrease being directly attributed to negative publicity or service issues in the last six months. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources do indicate a decline in Robinhood's user base, with the number of active users dropping from 17.3 million in 2021 to around 11.8 million in 2023 and the third quarter of 2024[2][3][4].\n- However, the reasons mentioned for this decline include a general decrease in user engagement and transaction revenue since the peak during the pandemic-driven trading frenzy, rather than specific negative publicity or service issues[2][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the user base decrease is due to negative publicity or service issues in the last six months is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi launched any major marketing campaigns targeting new users since October 2024?\nANSWER: While the sources do not explicitly mention a \"major marketing campaign\" launched by Kalshi specifically targeting new users since October 2024, they do indicate several initiatives and partnerships that could be seen as efforts to attract new users.\n\n- Kalshi has partnered with Zero Hash to enable seamless funding of accounts using USDC, which could attract new users by simplifying the funding process[2].\n- Kalshi announced a partnership with FOREX.com, which includes a $20 bonus for FOREX.com clients accessing the Kalshi platform to trade the US Presidential Election. This partnership is aimed at broadening access to Kalshi's platform for FOREX.com's clients[4].\n\nThese partnerships and integrations can be considered as efforts to attract and engage new users, although they may not be described as traditional \"marketing campaigns.\"\n\nGiven this context, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have user ratings for Kalshi on the Apple App Store improved over the last three months?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not offer specific data or trends regarding the improvement or decline of user ratings for Kalshi on the Apple App Store over the last three months. The sources discuss the app's popularity and rankings during the U.S. presidential election, as well as user reviews, but they do not provide a comparative analysis of user ratings over time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi experienced a significant increase in monthly active users in the past quarter?\nANSWER: Based on the available information, it is clear that Kalshi has experienced a significant increase in activity, although the specific metric of \"monthly active users\" is not directly addressed. Here are some key points that indicate a significant increase in activity:\n\n- Kalshi's web traffic has increased by 732.3% compared to the previous month, as of October 2024[5].\n- The platform saw a substantial growth in contracts related to the 2024 US Presidential election, with the value of political contracts rising from $15 million on October 15 to over $250 million by November 3[1].\n- Kalshi's mobile app has also seen significant traction, ranking first in the \"finance\" chart of Apple’s App Store and sixth overall[1].\n\nWhile these metrics do not explicitly state the number of monthly active users, they strongly suggest a significant increase in user engagement and activity on the platform. Therefore, the answer can be inferred as:\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 1 month and 12 days (43 days).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends continue without any significant changes, Kalshi would likely maintain its leading position over Robinhood in the top free Finance apps by December 31, 2024. Kalshi is currently ranked #1, while Robinhood is positioned at #8. Without any new developments, both apps would continue on their existing trajectories, keeping Kalshi ahead.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about 10-11 days remaining, the likelihood of significant shifts in app rankings diminishes. Given Kalshi's current lead and the short timeframe, it is probable that Kalshi would continue to outrank Robinhood unless Robinhood implements rapid and impactful changes to its app or marketing strategy.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith approximately 172 days until the outcome, there is ample time for both Kalshi and Robinhood to influence their app rankings through updates, marketing campaigns, user engagement initiatives, or other strategic changes. While Kalshi has a strong current position, Robinhood's established user base and resources could enable it to make significant moves to improve its ranking. However, given Kalshi's recent momentum and growth, it would still have a competitive advantage.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nKalshi has demonstrated robust growth and currently holds the #1 position in the Apple App Store's free Finance apps category. The company's focus on prediction markets, substantial funding, and strategic partnerships have contributed to its strong standing. Robinhood, while an established player with a large user base, is ranked #8 and has experienced a decline in active users. Although Robinhood has introduced new features and maintains a solid ranking, the existing gap between the two apps suggests that Kalshi is well-positioned to maintain its lead.\n\nThe additional time before the outcome allows for further consolidation of Kalshi's user base and potential enhancements to its app. While Robinhood has the capacity to close the gap, the current momentum in favor of Kalshi, combined with the specific focus on prediction markets where Kalshi has specialized offerings, supports a higher probability of Kalshi maintaining its top position over Robinhood.\n\n**Probability:** 80%",
