    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Larry Ellison be ranked in the top 2 of the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to the [Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#482980403d78) Larry Ellison is in 2nd place or better on December 31, 2024. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nA tie will count as **Yes**. If the resolution source is unavailable on December 31, 2024, resolution will wait until it is available (at which point it resolves based on the data shown), until January 3, 2024, at which point this question will be **annulled**. For more details on various edge cases regarding availability of or changes to the resolution source, please see Metaculus's ambiguity and annulment policies [here](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#ambiguous-annulled).  \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of October 8, 2024, Elon Musk is ranked first on the list, with $260.8B. Larry Ellison is ranked 2nd, with $211.6 B. Mark Zuckerberg is 3rd, with $205.0 B. Jeff Bezos was 4th, with 200.9B. Bernard Arnault & family\nwas 5th, with $183.1B. And Warren Buffett with 6th, with $142.2B.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Larry Ellison being ranked in the top 2 of the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List on December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Ranking\nAs of November 1, 2024, Larry Ellison is ranked as the second-richest person in the world, with a net worth of approximately $204.8 billion, just ahead of Jeff Bezos who has a net worth of $204.3 billion[4].\n\n## Recent Trends\nEllison's net worth has seen significant increases recently due to the surge in Oracle's stock prices. Since September 6, 2024, his fortune has increased by $34 billion, largely driven by strong earnings reports and new partnerships, including one with Amazon Web Services[2][4].\n\n## Market Volatility\nThe net worth of billionaires can fluctuate daily based on changes in the stock market. Ellison's wealth is heavily tied to Oracle's stock performance, which can be volatile. A significant drop in Oracle's stock price could impact his ranking[3][4].\n\n## Competition\nThe gap between Ellison and Bezos is relatively narrow, with only $500 million separating them. This close margin means that small changes in the stock prices of their respective companies could swap their positions[4].\n\n## Historical Context\nThe rankings of the world's richest individuals can change frequently due to market fluctuations and other economic factors. For example, Bill Gates recently dropped out of the top 10 due to a contraction in his fortune, highlighting the dynamic nature of these rankings[4].\n\nGiven these points, while Larry Ellison is currently in the second position, the answer to whether he will remain in the top 2 by December 31, 2024, is not immediately clear. The volatility of the stock market and the close competition with Jeff Bezos make it uncertain. Therefore, this question cannot be clearly answered as yes or no without further speculation. However, understanding the current trends, market dynamics, and the narrow margin between Ellison and Bezos will be crucial for making an informed prediction.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Oracle released a positive earnings report in the latest quarter?\nANSWER: YES\n\nOracle released a positive earnings report for the latest quarter, as indicated by several key metrics. The company reported a GAAP earnings per share increase of 20% to $1.03 and a non-GAAP earnings per share increase of 17% to $1.39. Additionally, the total revenue was up 7% in USD to $13.3 billion[2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Larry Ellison sold a significant portion of his Oracle holdings since September 6, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information indicating that Larry Ellison has sold a significant portion of his Oracle holdings since September 6, 2024. The sources discuss the increase in his net worth and the surge in Oracle's stock price, but they do not mention any sale of his holdings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Jeff Bezos's net worth exceeded $205 billion as of December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Jeff Bezos's net worth has exceeded $205 billion as of the end of 2024.\n\nAs of November 2024, Bezos's net worth was estimated to be around $228 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and *Forbes*[3][5].\n\nGiven that his net worth was already above $228 billion in November, it is clear that it would still be above $205 billion as of December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Oracle announced any new major partnerships since September 6, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Oracle has announced new major partnerships since September 6, 2024.\n\nOn September 9, 2024, Oracle announced strategic partnerships with Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. These partnerships involve integrating Oracle's database services, such as Oracle Autonomous Database and Oracle Exadata Database Service, into the cloud infrastructures of AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. This allows customers to access Oracle Database services directly within these cloud platforms, enhancing cloud migration, multicloud deployment, and management[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Oracle's stock price increased by more than 5% since September 6, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Oracle's stock price has increased by more than 5% since September 6, 2024.\n\nAs of September 6, 2024, Oracle's stock price was $141.81[5].\n\nBy September 16, 2024, Oracle's stock price had risen to $170.33, which is an increase of more than 5%[4].\n\nAdditionally, as of November 15, 2024, the stock price was $183.74, further indicating a significant increase[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Elon Musk's net worth decreased by more than $10 billion since October 1, 2024?\nANSWER: No, Elon Musk's net worth has not decreased by more than $10 billion since October 1, 2024. Instead, his net worth has significantly increased during this period.\n\nAs of October 2024, Musk's net worth was estimated to be around $263 billion to $270.3 billion[2][3][4].\n\nBy November 2024, his net worth had surged to over $300 billion, with estimates ranging from $308 billion to $335 billion, driven by increases in Tesla's stock and other favorable factors such as Donald Trump's reelection[1][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Jeff Bezos made any substantial investments that have increased his net worth since November 1, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no evidence of substantial new investments made by Jeff Bezos since November 1, 2024, that have increased his net worth.\n\n- The latest investment mentioned in the sources is from November 3, 2024, in Physical Intelligence, but this does not provide enough detail to determine if it was substantial enough to significantly increase his net worth[1].\n- The other sources discuss his past investments, net worth, and recent sales of Amazon shares, but do not mention any new substantial investments made after November 1, 2024[2][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant drop in Oracle's stock price in the last two months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there has not been a significant drop in Oracle's stock price over the last two months. Here are the key points:\n\n- As of November 12, 2024, Oracle's stock price was at $189.58, which is near its all-time high of $190.16[3].\n- The 52-week low of $99.26 is significantly lower than the current price, but this low occurred earlier in the year, not within the last two months[1][3].\n- The stock price has been relatively stable and even reached new highs in the recent period, indicating no significant drop in the last two months[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, there has not been a significant drop in Oracle's stock price in the last two months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a global economic downturn that negatively impacted technology stocks in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication of a global economic downturn specifically in 2024 that has negatively impacted technology stocks. Here are the key points:\n\n- Global economic growth is forecasted to be slow but steady in 2024, with various estimates ranging from 2.6% to 3.2%[1][3][4].\n- While there are risks and challenges such as geopolitical tensions, China's economic slowdown, and financial stress, these do not necessarily indicate a global economic downturn[2][3][5].\n- The sources mention economic resilience despite challenges and do not specifically highlight a downturn that would negatively impact technology stocks[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any major legal or regulatory action against Oracle in 2024?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nIn 2024, Oracle faced significant legal and regulatory action. Here are the key points:\n\n- Oracle agreed to pay $115 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging improper collection and sale of personal data without user consent. This settlement was reached in July 2024[1][2][4].\n- The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of California in August 2022, accused Oracle of violating various privacy laws, including the California Constitution, California common law, the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)[1][2][3].\n- As part of the settlement, Oracle agreed to implement changes to its business practices, such as not capturing certain types of user-generated information and implementing an audit program to review customer compliance with consumer privacy obligations[1][3][4].\n- Following the settlement, Oracle announced its decision to exit the ad tech business entirely, citing falling revenues and increasing privacy regulations[1][2][3].",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\nApproximately 1 month and 12 days remain until December 31, 2024.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\nIf all current standings and financial positions remained unchanged, Larry Ellison would maintain his position in the top 2 of the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\nWith only about 3 weeks remaining, short-term market fluctuations are less likely to drastically alter the rankings. Therefore, if only a quarter of the time remained, the probability of Ellison remaining in the top 2 would be relatively high, estimated around 80%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\nWith an extended timeframe of approximately 6 months, there is greater potential for significant market changes, investments, or other factors that could influence net worth rankings. In this scenario, the probability of Ellison remaining in the top 2 would decrease, estimated around 20%.\n\n**Rationale:**\nAs of November 19, 2024, Larry Ellison is closely ranked with Jeff Bezos, with Ellison at approximately \\$204.8 billion and Bezos at \\$204.3 billion. Recent financial activities have seen Ellison's net worth increase due to Oracle's strong performance. However, the subquestions indicate that by the end of 2024, Jeff Bezos's net worth exceeds \\$205 billion, reaching approximately \\$228 billion. This substantial increase positions Bezos well above Ellison, reducing the likelihood of Ellison maintaining his top 2 status. Given the narrow margins and the dynamic nature of billionaire rankings influenced by stock market performance and investments, the probability of Ellison remaining in the top 2 by December 31, 2024, is low.\n\nProbability: 15%",
