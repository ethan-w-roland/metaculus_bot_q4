    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Donald Trump win Arizona and Georgia in the 2024 election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald Trump wins the popular vote in Arizona and Georgia in the 2024 presidential election. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Election Forecast Correlations](https://roadtolarissa.com/forecast-correlation/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Donald Trump winning Arizona and Georgia in the 2024 presidential election, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Arizona\n- As of the latest polls, Donald Trump is leading Kamala Harris in Arizona by a narrow margin. According to 270toWin, Trump leads Harris by 1.7% based on an average of seven polls, with the latest conducted as of October 27.\n- Arizona is considered a crucial swing state, having flipped to Democratic in the 2020 presidential election when Joe Biden won by a slim margin of about 10,000 votes. This historical context suggests that the state is highly competitive.\n- The state's demographics, including a significant Hispanic population (31.6%), and the presence of independent voters (29.15% of registered voters as of November 2023) could influence the outcome.\n\n## Georgia\n- In Georgia, Trump is also leading, but by a very slight margin. As of the latest polls, Trump leads Harris by 0.9% based on an average of six polls, with the latest conducted as of October 27.\n- Georgia is another swing state where the election is expected to be closely contested. The state has seen shifts in voter demographics and voting patterns in recent elections, making it a critical battleground.\n\n## General Election Context\n- Both Arizona and Georgia are among the key swing states that could decide the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. The polls in these states, as well as others, are extremely close and within the margin of error, indicating a high level of uncertainty.\n- National polls show Harris with a narrow lead, but Trump is ahead in some of the critical swing states, highlighting the complexity and competitiveness of the election.\n\nGiven the current polling data and the historical context, it is not possible to definitively predict whether Donald Trump will win Arizona and Georgia with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" The elections in these states are highly competitive, and the outcomes could go either way based on various factors, including voter turnout, last-minute campaign efforts, and any unforeseen events that might influence voter decisions.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are independent voters in Georgia showing a preference for Donald Trump in recent polls?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about the preferences of independent voters in Georgia. The sources discuss the overall polling trends and the general race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in Georgia, but they do not provide details on how independent voters are leaning.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any significant events or scandals recently that negatively impact Donald Trump's campaign in Arizona?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any significant recent events or scandals that specifically negatively impact Donald Trump's campaign in Arizona. The sources focus on his campaign rallies, policy discussions, and the ongoing election campaign dynamics, but they do not report any scandals or negative events affecting his campaign in Arizona.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout among Republican voters in early voting higher than in 2020 in Arizona?\nANSWER: Yes, voter turnout among Republican voters in early voting is higher in Arizona compared to 2020.\n\n- In 2020, Republicans made up around 32-33% of the early vote in Arizona. However, in the current election, Republicans account for 42-43% of the early vote, which is a significant increase from the previous election cycle.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are independent voters in Arizona showing a preference for Donald Trump in recent polls?\nANSWER: Based on the recent polls, independent voters in Arizona are not showing a clear or significant preference for Donald Trump over Kamala Harris.\n\nAccording to the CNN poll, independent voters in Arizona are divided, with 45% favoring Trump and 43% supporting Harris. This indicates a relatively even split among independent voters rather than a clear preference for Trump.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the polling margins for Donald Trump in Arizona outside the margin of error?\nANSWER: No, the polling margins for Donald Trump in Arizona are not outside the margin of error. According to the sources, Trump has a slim lead in Arizona, but it is within a narrow margin. For example, The Guardian mentions that Trump leads by four points in Arizona, which is still within the margin of error given the tightness of the race.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump leading in the majority of recent reputable polls in Arizona as of October 29, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, as of October 29, 2024, Donald Trump is indeed leading in the majority of recent polls in Arizona, although the lead is very slim.\n\n- A report from Fox 10 Phoenix indicates that Trump leads Harris by 1.7% in Arizona from an average of seven polls in the state, with the latest conducted as of October 27.\n- The 270toWin website also shows that Trump is ahead of Harris in Arizona, with an average of 8 polls indicating Trump at 48.9% and Harris at 47.1%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump leading in the majority of recent reputable polls in Georgia as of October 29, 2024?\nANSWER: As of October 29, 2024, the polling data indicates that Donald Trump is not consistently leading in the majority of recent reputable polls in Georgia. Here are the key points:\n\n- According to the New York Times, the race in Georgia is very close, with neither candidate having a significant lead.\n- The Guardian reports that Trump holds a slight edge of one to two points in Georgia, which is within the margin of error.\n- Fox10Phoenix and 270toWin indicate that Trump leads by a very narrow margin of 0.9% in Georgia, based on the average of recent polls.\n- FiveThirtyEight's polling averages also show a very tight race, with no clear majority lead for Trump.\n\nGiven that the leads are extremely narrow and within the margin of error, it is not accurate to say that Trump is leading in the majority of recent reputable polls in a decisive manner.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the polling margins for Donald Trump in Georgia outside the margin of error?\nANSWER: No, the polling margins for Donald Trump in Georgia are not outside the margin of error. According to the sources, the polls in Georgia show Trump and Harris to be very close, often within the margin of error.\n\nFor example, the Trafalgar Group's survey showed Trump leading with 48% to Harris' 46%, with a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points.\nA poll by Redfield and Wilton Strategies also showed Trump leading with 48% against Harris' 46%, which is also within the margin of error.\nAdditionally, a Marist College poll found equal backing for both candidates, each receiving 49%, indicating a tie within the margin of error.\n\nThese results indicate that the polling margins in Georgia are too close to be considered outside the margin of error.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any significant events or scandals recently that negatively impact Donald Trump's campaign in Georgia?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several significant events and ongoing issues that could negatively impact Donald Trump's campaign in Georgia:\n\n## Ongoing Legal Issues\nDonald Trump is facing a sprawling criminal case in Georgia related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Despite some recent legal victories, such as the dismissal of several charges, the case remains a significant issue. The indictment includes 41 criminal counts against Trump and 18 others, alleging a wide-ranging scheme to interfere with the election. The case is currently stalled due to pending appeals, but it continues to draw attention and could impact public perception.\n\n## Public Feuds\nTrump has been involved in a public feud with Georgia's Republican Governor, Brian Kemp, which has been described as self-destructive and potentially harmful to Trump's campaign in the state. Trump's repeated criticism of Kemp has made the state more challenging for him to win.\n\n## Campaign Spending and Strategy\nThe Trump campaign is spending heavily in Georgia to offset the negative impact of Trump's attacks on Governor Kemp and other local issues. However, the need for such significant spending indicates the challenges Trump faces in the state.\n\n## Delayed Trial and Appeals\nThe trial in the Georgia election interference case is unlikely to take place before the November election due to ongoing appeals and other legal challenges. This ongoing legal uncertainty can continue to cast a shadow over Trump's campaign.\n\nThese factors collectively contribute to a challenging environment for Trump's campaign in Georgia.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout among Republican voters in early voting higher than in 2020 in Georgia?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that there has been a shift in early voting patterns among Republican voters in Georgia compared to 2020.\n\n- The sources indicate that Republicans are now more inclined to vote early, contrary to the anti-early voting rhetoric of 2020. Trump has explicitly urged his supporters to vote early in person, and many seem to be following this advice.\n- While specific partisan data for Georgia is not detailed in the sources, the general trend across key battleground states shows an increase in Republican early voting participation. For instance, in states where data is available, Republicans now represent a higher percentage of early voters compared to 2020.\n\nGiven this context, although the sources do not provide explicit numbers for Georgia specifically, the overall trend suggests that voter turnout among Republican voters in early voting is likely higher than in 2020.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nThe 2024 U.S. presidential election is scheduled for Tuesday, November 5, 2024. Today's date is October 29, 2024. Therefore, there are **7 days** left until the election results will start to become known.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and Election Day, based on current polling data and early voting trends, Donald Trump holds very narrow leads in both Arizona and Georgia. These leads are within the margins of error, indicating that the races are effectively statistical ties. Given the slight leads and higher Republican early voting turnout, it is possible that Trump could win both states, but the outcome remains highly uncertain due to the tightness of the races.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **2 days** left until the election, the likelihood of significant events altering the current dynamics would be reduced. Given the current slight leads and early voting patterns favoring Republicans, I would slightly **increase** the probability of Trump winning both Arizona and Georgia compared to my current estimate.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **28 days** (4 weeks) left until the election, there would be more opportunity for events that could impact voter sentiment, such as debates, significant news stories, or campaign developments. Given the potential for increased volatility over a longer period, I would slightly **decrease** the probability of Trump winning both states compared to my current estimate.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**1. Current Polling Data:**\n\n- **Arizona:**\n  - Donald Trump leads Kamala Harris by an average of **1.7%** based on recent polls.\n  - The lead is within the **margin of error**, indicating a highly competitive race.\n  - **Independent voters** in Arizona are nearly evenly split, with 45% favoring Trump and 43% supporting Harris.\n- **Georgia:**\n  - Trump leads Harris by an average of **0.9%** based on recent polls.\n  - This lead is also within the **margin of error**.\n  - **Independent voters**' preferences are unclear due to a lack of specific data.\n\n**2. Early Voting and Voter Turnout:**\n\n- **Arizona:**\n  - Republican early voting turnout is higher than in 2020, with Republicans accounting for **42-43%** of the early vote (an increase from 32-33% in 2020).\n- **Georgia:**\n  - While specific numbers are not provided, there is a trend of increased early voting participation among Republicans in key battleground states.\n  - Trump's encouragement for supporters to vote early suggests a strategic shift that may benefit his campaign.\n\n**3. Demographics and Historical Context:**\n\n- **Arizona:**\n  - The state's significant **Hispanic population** (31.6%) traditionally leans Democratic but is not monolithic in voting behavior.\n  - A substantial portion of **independent voters** (29.15%) adds to the unpredictability.\n- **Georgia:**\n  - Demographic shifts, including growth in urban and suburban areas, have made Georgia more competitive.\n  - In the **2020 election**, Biden won Georgia by a margin of approximately **12,000 votes**.\n\n**4. Recent Events and Campaign Dynamics:**\n\n- **Legal Issues in Georgia:**\n  - Trump faces ongoing legal challenges related to alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia.\n  - While some charges have been dismissed, the presence of legal issues could negatively impact voter perception.\n  - Trump's public feud with Republican Governor **Brian Kemp** may alienate some Republican voters.\n\n- **Campaign in Arizona:**\n  - No significant recent events or scandals specifically negatively impacting Trump's campaign have been reported.\n\n**5. Correlation Between States:**\n\n- There is likely a **positive correlation** between Trump's performance in Arizona and Georgia due to:\n\n  - Similar national campaign influences.\n  - Shared demographic trends affecting voter behavior in swing states.\n  - The impact of nationwide events on voter sentiment in multiple states.\n\n- However, the correlation is not perfect due to state-specific factors.\n\n**6. Base Rates and Statistical Considerations:**\n\n- Winning both states requires calculating the joint probability.\n- Assuming Trump's chances of winning are approximately **55%** in Arizona and **50%** in Georgia individually.\n- If treated as independent events: 0.55 (Arizona) * 0.50 (Georgia) = **27.5%** chance of winning both.\n- Considering positive correlation, the joint probability would be higher than 27.5% but less than 55%.\n\n**7. Additional Factors:**\n\n- **Margin of Error:**\n  - The leads being within the margin of error suggest that polling uncertainties are significant.\n- **Undecided Voters:**\n  - A portion of voters remains undecided, who could swing the results in either direction.\n- **Early Voting Patterns:**\n  - Increased Republican early voting may indicate higher overall enthusiasm among Trump's base.\n\n---\n\n**Probability Estimation:**\n\nTaking into account the slight leads in both states, the higher Republican early voting turnout, the uncertainties due to margins of error, and the positive correlation between the outcomes in Arizona and Georgia, I estimate the probability that Donald Trump will win both states as follows:\n\n- Base joint probability (assuming independence): **27.5%**\n- Adjusting for positive correlation and current trends: **+17.5%**\n\n**Final Probability Estimate:**\n\n**Probability: 45%**\n\n---\n\nThis estimate reflects the significant uncertainty in the races due to tight polling margins and the fact that both states are highly competitive battlegrounds. While Trump's campaign has favorable indicators such as increased early voting turnout among Republicans, there are also factors that could hinder his success, particularly in Georgia. The positive correlation between the states increases the joint probability compared to treating them as independent events, but the overall likelihood remains less than even.",
