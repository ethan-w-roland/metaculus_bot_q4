    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill armed conflicts between the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) lead to at least 100 deaths before 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, at any time before January 1, 2025, either of the following occur:\n\n*    There are at least three credible government sources reporting at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of Taiwan and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.\n*    There are at least three credible news reports that at least one exchange of weapon fire between the national military forces or law enforcement personnel of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China causing a total of at least 100 deaths.\n\nPlease note: positive resolution could in theory be the result of a few incidents separated by multiple years if the total number of deaths from such incidents will reach at least 100 from now till the end of 2024.\n\nThis question will resolve as **No** otherwise.\n\nIn the context of this question, an armed conflict will be defined as a dispute that concerns a government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in an exchange of weapon fire or detonations\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) claims sovereignty over the land currently controlled by the [Republic of China (Taiwan)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) and has been increasingly belligerent in recent years about their claim here. NBC news [recently claimed](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/threat-china-invading-taiwan-growing-every-day-what-u-s-ncna1273386) that the threat of China invading Taiwan is \"growing every day\".\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of armed conflicts between the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) leading to at least 100 deaths before 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Tensions and Military Posture\n- The relationship between Taiwan and the PRC is increasingly tense, with the PRC employing various coercive tactics short of armed conflict, including large-scale military exercises, air incursions, and naval patrols near Taiwan.\n- The PRC has been modernizing its military, particularly focusing on capabilities needed to annex Taiwan, and some observers believe the PLA could be ready to execute a range of military campaigns against Taiwan by 2025.\n\n## Recent Incidents and Escalations\n- Following the 2024 Taiwanese presidential election, the PRC has escalated its pressure on Taiwan, including increased air incursions, naval patrols, and economic measures. This escalation has been particularly noticeable around Taiwan’s outlying islands like Kinmen.\n- There have been recent incidents, such as the February 2024 clash between Taiwan’s coast guard and a PRC vessel, which resulted in deaths and further heightened tensions.\n\n## Potential Trigger Points\n- Several potential trigger points could lead to increased conflict in the near future, including the Taiwanese presidential election in January 2024, the U.S. presidential elections in November 2024, and the PLA’s centennial in 2027. However, the most immediate concern is the period between 2024 and 2025, given Taiwan’s military predictions about the PRC’s readiness to invade.\n\n## Historical Context\n- The Taiwan Strait has seen several crises in the past, including the First and Second Taiwan Strait Crises in the 1950s, which involved significant military engagements and resulted in substantial casualties. While these crises were resolved without leading to a full-scale war, they highlight the potential for violent conflict.\n\n## Uncertainty and Speculation\n- Despite these tensions and potential trigger points, there is significant uncertainty about whether and when a full-scale armed conflict might occur. Experts disagree on the likelihood and timing of a Chinese invasion, and various factors, including international reactions and the U.S. political landscape, play a crucial role in determining the PRC’s actions.\n\nGiven these points, while there is a heightened risk of conflict and the potential for significant casualties, it is not possible to definitively predict whether armed conflicts will lead to at least 100 deaths before 2025. The situation remains highly volatile and dependent on multiple variables, including the actions of key stakeholders and the broader geopolitical context.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the February 2024 clash between Taiwan's coast guard and a PRC vessel resulted in cumulative casualties of at least 100 deaths?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe sources clearly indicate that the February 2024 clash between Taiwan's coast guard and a PRC vessel resulted in the deaths of two Chinese fishermen, but there is no mention of cumulative casualties totaling at least 100 deaths.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the PRC launched a military invasion of Taiwan since January 1, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources provided do not indicate that the People's Republic of China (PRC) has launched a military invasion of Taiwan since January 1, 2024.

    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately 56 days remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changes between now and January 1, 2025, the outcome would be **No**, as there have been no reported armed conflicts between Taiwan and the PRC resulting in a total of at least 100 deaths.\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about 14 days left until the deadline, the probability of the question resolving as **Yes** would be even lower due to the minimal time for significant developments to occur.\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately 224 days left (extending the deadline to mid-2025), the probability would increase somewhat, given more time for potential escalations, but significant uncertainties would remain.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 6, 2024, tensions between the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) remain high, with increased military activities and political posturing by the PRC. However, despite these heightened tensions, there have been no incidents resulting in armed conflict causing at least 100 deaths.\n\nThe window until January 1, 2025, is relatively short—less than two months. While unforeseen events can occur, the likelihood of a sudden escalation leading to significant casualties is relatively low within this time frame. Both Taiwan and the PRC are likely cautious about provoking an outright conflict due to the severe economic and political repercussions that would follow.\n\nKey factors influencing this assessment include:\n\n- **Recent Incidents:** The most significant recent clash resulted in two deaths, far below the 100-death threshold.\n\n- **International Relations:** The international community, including the United States, plays a stabilizing role. With the U.S. presidential elections just concluded, it's less likely that dramatic shifts in U.S. policy would provoke a sudden change in PRC actions before January 2025.\n\n- **PRC Strategic Considerations:** While the PRC has been modernizing its military and increasing pressure on Taiwan, launching a conflict resulting in significant casualties would undermine regional stability and could hinder the PRC's long-term strategic goals.\n\n- **Historical Patterns:** Historically, periods of increased tensions have not necessarily led to large-scale armed conflicts resulting in high casualties.\n\nGiven these factors, while the probability is not zero due to the unpredictable nature of international relations, it remains low for the specified time frame.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nProbability: **5%**",
