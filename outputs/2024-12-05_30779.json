    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Yoon Suk Yeol be President of South Korea on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Yoon Suk Yeol is President of the Republic of Korea (also known as South Korea) on December 31, 2024. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nRegardless of the circumstances, if Yoon Suk Yeol legally holds the office of President of the Republic of Korea on December 31, 2024, this question resolves as Yes\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Thousands of professors join call for president to resign](https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20241129133043835)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Yoon Suk Yeol being the President of South Korea on December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Status\nYoon Suk Yeol is currently the President of South Korea, having assumed office on May 10, 2022, after winning the presidential election on March 9, 2022[2].\n\n## Political Challenges\nYoon's administration has faced significant challenges, including low approval ratings, the 2022 Seoul Halloween crowd crush, and the ongoing 2024 South Korean medical crisis. His party, the People Power Party (PPP), suffered a landslide defeat in the 2024 parliamentary elections, which has weakened his political position. This has led some to describe him as a \"lame duck\" president[2].\n\n## Martial Law Declaration\nRecently, on December 3, 2024, Yoon declared martial law, a move that was quickly nullified by the National Assembly. This event highlights the intense political turmoil and the opposition he is facing[2][3].\n\n## Parliamentary Opposition\nThe opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) now holds a significant majority in the National Assembly, which further diminishes Yoon's ability to implement his policies and maintain strong political control[2].\n\n## Base Rates and Time to Resolution\nGiven that Yoon has already declared martial law and had it nullified, and considering the weakened state of his political power, there is a heightened sense of instability. However, the South Korean political system does not typically see presidents removed from office abruptly unless through impeachment or resignation.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile Yoon Suk Yeol is currently the President of South Korea, the political environment is highly volatile. The question of whether he will remain in office on December 31, 2024, cannot be answered with certainty based on the current information. Factors such as potential impeachment proceedings, further political crises, or Yoon's own decisions regarding his tenure could influence the outcome. Therefore, the answer is not immediately clear and would require ongoing monitoring of the political situation in South Korea.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Yoon Suk Yeol currently serving as the President of South Korea?\nANSWER: YES\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol was inaugurated as the 20th President of the Republic of Korea on May 10, 2022, and there is no indication in the provided source that he has left office since then[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Yoon Suk Yeol faced any significant resignations from his administration in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is information about a significant resignation following the martial law declaration. After President Yoon Suk Yeol declared and then lifted the martial law, his chief of staff resigned[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Yoon Suk Yeol's approval ratings above 40% as of December 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nAs of December 2024, President Yoon Suk Yeol's approval ratings are not above 40%. According to the latest surveys, his approval rating has been around 25%[3][4][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Yoon Suk Yeol announced his intention to resign before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not indicate that President Yoon Suk Yeol has announced his intention to resign. Instead, they discuss the opposition's efforts to impeach him and the political turmoil following his declaration of martial law, but there is no mention of Yoon announcing his resignation[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the People Power Party secure a majority in the 2024 South Korean parliamentary elections?\nANSWER: No, the People Power Party (PPP) did not secure a majority in the 2024 South Korean parliamentary elections. The Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) and its allies won a majority of the seats, with the DPK securing between 161 to 175 seats depending on the source, while the PPP secured 90 to 108 seats[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Was Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law on December 3, 2024, upheld by the National Assembly?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe provided source does not mention whether Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law on December 3, 2024, was upheld by the National Assembly. It discusses the declaration, the reasons given by the president, and the concerns about human rights, but it does not address the National Assembly's response or decision regarding the martial law declaration[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the Democratic Party of Korea hold a majority in the South Korean National Assembly as of December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the Democratic Party of Korea holds a majority in the South Korean National Assembly as of December 2024. The sources indicate that the Democratic Party and other smaller opposition parties together control the majority of the 300-seat parliament[2][3]. Specifically, it is mentioned that the Democratic Party and other small opposition parties have 192 seats, which is a majority in the National Assembly[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Yoon Suk Yeol been formally impeached by the National Assembly of South Korea?\nANSWER: To determine whether Yoon Suk Yeol has been formally impeached by the National Assembly of South Korea, we need to check the most recent and reliable sources of information on this topic.\n\nAs of my last update in October 2023, there was no information indicating that Yoon Suk Yeol had been formally impeached. However, since my knowledge may not be up to date, it is crucial to consult the latest news and official statements from the National Assembly of South Korea or other credible sources.\n\nGiven the current information available to me, I cannot confirm whether Yoon Suk Yeol has been formally impeached.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any legal challenges to Yoon Suk Yeol's presidency since December 3, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been legal challenges to Yoon Suk Yeol's presidency since December 3, 2024.\n\nFollowing Yoon's declaration of martial law, the opposition parties quickly reacted by submitting an impeachment motion against him. This motion was filed in the National Assembly, and voting on the impeachment is expected to take place in the next few days[2][3].\n\nAdditionally, if the impeachment motion passes with a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, the Constitutional Court would then decide whether Yoonâ€™s impeachment is valid[1][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Yoon Suk Yeol successfully addressed the 2024 South Korean medical crisis?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe 2024 South Korean medical crisis, triggered by the increase in medical student quotas and the subsequent strike by doctors, remains unresolved. Here are some key points that indicate the crisis is still ongoing:\n\n- Despite the government's efforts to increase the medical student quota, thousands of resident and intern doctors have resigned and not returned to work, leading to severe staffing shortages and significant disruptions in medical services[1][3].\n- The crisis has resulted in increased patient deaths, delayed treatments, and financial troubles for hospitals[1][3].\n- The government has implemented various measures, such as deploying military and public health doctors, expanding the role of nurses, and setting up emergency response systems, but these have not fully alleviated the crisis[3].\n- The situation continues to be dire, with reports of patients dying due to delayed treatment and the medical system still under significant strain[1][3].\n\nThese points indicate that President Yoon Suk Yeol has not successfully addressed the 2024 South Korean medical crisis.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n26 days (from December 5, 2024, to December 31, 2024)\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\nYoon Suk Yeol remains President of South Korea.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\nWith approximately 6-7 days left, the impeachment proceedings would be in their final stages. Given the current political climate and the opposition's majority in the National Assembly, there is a heightened likelihood that the impeachment could succeed, leading to Yoon Suk Yeol's removal from office.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\nWith around 104 days, there would be ample time for political maneuvers, negotiations, or unforeseen events that could either solidify Yoon's position or lead to his resignation. However, given the current trajectory of political instability and opposition strength, the probability of Yoon remaining in office might slightly increase as stabilizing factors come into play, but significant challenges would still persist.\n\n**Rationale:**\nAs of December 5, 2024, Yoon Suk Yeol's presidency is under significant threat due to low approval ratings, the nullification of his martial law declaration, and the Democratic Party of Korea holding a majority in the National Assembly. The ongoing impeachment motion, supported by the majority opposition, substantially increases the likelihood of his removal from office. Historically, South Korea has seen presidents removed through impeachment, especially when facing overwhelming legislative opposition and public dissatisfaction. Given the current political instability and the procedural momentum behind the impeachment, the probability of Yoon Suk Yeol remaining President by December 31, 2024, is diminished.\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
