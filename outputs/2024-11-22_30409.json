    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew program make it to 2025 without being cancelled?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if either of these occur: 1) The Boeing Starliner Program is not canceled before January 1, 2025. 2) The Boeing Starliner Program completes its first operational flight before January 1, 2025.  The question resolves as **No** if either of these events occur before January 1, 2025: 1) The Boeing Starliner Program ceases to be part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. 2) Boeing withdraws from the NASA Commercial Crew Program before completing its first [operational flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1).\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThere is a decent chance that additional test or demonstration flights are performed, and these are not counted in this case. The deciding flight needs to be distinctly considered an \"operational\" flight, the \"Post Certification Mission-1\" or \"Boeing Starliner-1.\"\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBoeing, one of two selected contractors for the [NASA Commercial Crew program](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/commercial-crew-program/) (the other being SpaceX), has developed its spacecraft, named *Starliner* to deliver astronauts to and from the ISS. \n\nUnfortunately, since inception, this Boeing program has been riddled with issues and delays. The [first orbital demo flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Orbital_Flight_Test), taking place in December 2019, was a failure as while the capsule was safely recovered, multiple serious issues during flight resulted in not completing mission objectives, such as reaching and docking with the ISS. \n\nDue to these issues, Boeing agreed to perform a [second orbital flight test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Orbital_Flight_Test_2) at \"no cost to the taxpayer\" with an estimated US$410 million out-of-pocket expenditure, and while this mission was nominally successful with the spacecraft docking to the ISS and returning safely, multiple serious issues were discovered both pre-launch--causing delays--and during operation including numerous failures of the maneuvering thruster system. \n\nThe latest flight of Starliner, the [crew flight test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crew_Flight_Test) launched in 2024 and gained massive media attention as failures in the thruster system resulted in the astronauts getting \"stranded\" aboard the ISS. After investigation, Boeing and NASA have decided to not risk returning the astronauts on the partially defective Starliner capsule, instead returning them on a different spacecraft. The defective Starliner will return to earth, unmanned. \n\nLooking towards the future, there is currently a planned [Starliner-1 mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner-1) in the \"fully operational phase\" of the Starliner Commercial Crew program, scheduled for no earlier than August, 2025. This mission, if it takes place, will begin a series of regular operational missions where Starliner transports four astronauts up to the ISS on a schedule. \n\nGenerally though, there are serious doubts about the future of the Boeing Starliner program. [For example, NASA has already double-booked the Starliner-1 Flight with the SpaceX-11 Flight](https://spacepolicyonline.com/news/starliner-passes-in-orbit-tests-but-first-operational-launch-slips/) in anticipation that Boeing will not be ready in time.\n\nThe technical issues, and more critically, the apparent inability of Boeing to fix known technical issues throw serious doubt upon Boeing's engineering skill and commitment to the program, making it likely that, for example, NASA insists on a fourth demo flight or potentially, Boeing decides to cut their losses and cancels the program.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew program continuing into 2025 without being cancelled, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Status and Challenges\n- The Boeing Starliner has faced significant setbacks, including thruster malfunctions during the Crew Flight Test in June 2024, which led to the decision to return the spacecraft to Earth without its crew[3][4][5].\n- This test flight was part of the Commercial Crew Program, and the issues encountered have delayed the program's progress.\n\n## Financial and Budgetary Issues\n- Boeing has exceeded its initial budget by at least $1.6 billion as of July 2024, which is a significant financial strain[4].\n- Despite the budget overruns, NASA has agreed to additional payments to ensure Boeing continues as a second commercial crew provider[4].\n\n## NASA's Commitment and Support\n- NASA has expressed continued support for the Starliner program, emphasizing the importance of having multiple American crew launch systems for redundancy and continued human space operations[3][4].\n- NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg have committed to continuing the Starliner program despite the recent setbacks[4].\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n- The program is in competition with SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which has already demonstrated reliability in multiple flights to the International Space Station. This competition adds pressure on Boeing to resolve its issues quickly[3].\n\n## Future Plans and Commitments\n- Boeing and NASA are planning further tests and missions, including simulation and flight readiness reviews, to address the current issues and ensure the Starliner's safety and functionality[2].\n- NASA has ordered six Boeing crew rotation missions to the International Space Station, indicating a long-term commitment to the program[1].\n\nGiven these points, while there are significant challenges and financial pressures, there is no clear indication that the program will be cancelled immediately. NASA's commitment to maintaining multiple crew launch systems and the ongoing efforts to resolve the issues with the Starliner suggest that the program is likely to continue into 2025, albeit with a cautious and monitored approach.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The success rate of similar space programs, such as SpaceX's Crew Dragon, can serve as a reference class, but each program has its unique challenges.\n- The historical context of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, which was designed to foster competition and redundancy, supports the continuation of multiple programs.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The resolution of the current issues and the completion of necessary tests and simulations will be crucial in determining the program's future. The timeframe for these resolutions will likely extend into 2025.\n\nIn summary, while the Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew program faces substantial challenges, the current information suggests that it is likely to continue into 2025, supported by NASA's commitment to redundancy in crew launch systems and ongoing efforts to address the program's issues.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Boeing Starliner-1 mission been officially scheduled for August 2025?\nANSWER: The Boeing Starliner-1 mission has not been officially scheduled for August 2025, but rather it has been delayed to at least August 2025. The exact timing and configuration of the Starliner-1 mission will be determined once a better understanding of Boeingâ€™s path to system certification is established[1][3][4].\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Boeing Starliner-1 mission completed its first operational flight before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe Boeing Starliner-1 mission, which is the first operational flight of the Starliner, has not completed its first operational flight before January 1, 2025. According to the sources, the launch of Starliner-1 was initially hoped to be in February 2025, but it has been delayed further, with the mission now scheduled for August 2025[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has NASA not announced any cancellation plans for the Boeing Starliner program as of November 2024?\nANSWER: As of the provided sources, there is no mention of NASA announcing any cancellation plans for the Boeing Starliner program. The sources discuss the decision to return the Starliner spacecraft uncrewed due to technical issues, the ongoing testing and data collection, and the plans for future certification and missions, but they do not indicate any intention to cancel the program.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Boeing announced any additional demo flights for the Starliner program after the June 2024 Crew Flight Test?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of Boeing announcing additional demo flights for the Starliner program after the June 2024 Crew Flight Test. The sources discuss the recent Crew Flight Test, past test flights, and some of the challenges and future operational plans, but they do not specify any new demo flights scheduled after the June 2024 test.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has NASA provided additional funding to Boeing for the Starliner program after July 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that NASA has provided additional funding to Boeing for the Starliner program after July 2024. The sources discuss the existing contract and cost overruns that Boeing is covering, but they do not mention any new funding from NASA after July 2024.\n\n- The sources explain the fixed-price contract and the costs Boeing has incurred, but there is no mention of new funding from NASA[1][2][4].\n- The latest updates on the program focus on the delays, technical issues, and Boeing's financial charges, without any reference to new funding from NASA[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has SpaceX Crew Dragon completed all scheduled missions without significant delays as of November 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 2024, there is evidence to suggest that while many SpaceX Crew Dragon missions have been completed, there have been some significant delays and issues.\n\n- The Crew 8 mission, for example, returned to Earth after a 235-day expedition, which was about a month longer than expected due to various delays, including high winds and rough seas related to hurricanes Helene and Milton[3].\n- Additionally, there were medical evaluations and a hospitalization of one crew member after the splashdown, indicating some complications[3].\n\nGiven these instances, it is clear that not all scheduled missions have been completed without significant delays.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Boeing Starliner program still part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the Boeing Starliner program is still part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program as of November 2024. Despite the recent decision to return the Starliner spacecraft uncrewed due to safety concerns and ongoing testing, NASA and Boeing continue to work together to gather data, address issues, and prepare for future flights to the International Space Station[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Boeing successfully resolved the thruster system issues identified in the June 2024 Crew Flight Test?\nANSWER: The thruster system issues identified in the June 2024 Crew Flight Test of Boeing's Starliner have not been fully resolved yet, although significant progress has been made.\n\n- The hot fire tests conducted on July 27 showed that 27 of the 28 RCS thrusters performed within expected parameters, with the thrusters operating at peak thrust rating values[1][2][4].\n- However, the root causes of the thruster failures and helium leaks are still being investigated. Ground tests and simulations have provided insights into the issues, such as the heating of the thruster \"doghouses\" and the degradation of seals, but a final solution or design change to prevent these issues in the future has not been implemented or confirmed[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, while the current mission has seen improvements and stabilization of the thruster system, the underlying issues have not been completely resolved.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has NASA ordered six crew rotation missions for Boeing Starliner as of November 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 2024, NASA has not ordered six crew rotation missions for the Boeing Starliner. Instead, due to the ongoing issues and delays with the Starliner's certification, NASA has decided to use SpaceX's Crew Dragon for its crew rotation missions in 2025, including Crew-10 and Crew-11[4][5].\n\nThe Starliner's Crew Flight Test mission, which launched in June 2024, encountered several issues, leading NASA to delay the certification and operational use of the Starliner. As a result, the Starliner-1 mission has been delayed from February to August 2025, and NASA is still evaluating whether another test flight is needed before certifying the Starliner for regular missions[4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Boeing exceeded its budget by more than $1.6 billion as of July 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that Boeing has incurred significant losses and exceeded various budget and cost expectations.\n\n- In the second quarter of 2024, Boeing reported a GAAP loss per share of ($2.33) and a core loss per share of ($2.90), with operating cash flow of ($3.9) billion and free cash flow of ($4.3) billion. This indicates substantial financial strain[3].\n- The third-quarter loss for 2024 was $6 billion, which is the largest since the start of the pandemic in 2020. The commercial airplanes unit alone had a loss of over $4 billion in the third quarter[4].\n- Boeing has also reported significant \"abnormal production costs\" related to its 787 and 777X programs, amounting to over $1.5 billion in 2023[2].\n\nGiven these figures, it is evident that Boeing's losses and additional costs have far exceeded $1.6 billion as of July 2024.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nNovember 22, 2024, to January 1, 2025, is approximately 39 days.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends continue without any significant improvements, it is likely that the Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew program will face cancellation before January 1, 2025, due to unresolved technical issues, continued delays, and substantial budget overruns.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 10 days remaining, the probability of cancellation would likely increase due to limited time to address ongoing challenges. Forecast Probability: 70%\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith around 144 days until resolution, there is more time to implement fixes, secure additional funding, and demonstrate progress. This extended timeframe could improve the chances of the program continuing. Forecast Probability: 50%\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe Boeing Starliner Commercial Crew program has encountered persistent technical difficulties, including thruster malfunctions and delays in achieving mission objectives. As of November 2024, Boeing has already exceeded its budget by more than $1.6 billion, and there is uncertainty regarding the resolution of critical issues such as the thruster system's reliability. NASA's commitment to maintaining multiple crew launch systems provides some support, but the competitiveness with SpaceX's more reliable Crew Dragon adds pressure on Boeing to perform.\n\nGiven the tight timeframe of 39 days until January 1, 2025, Boeing faces significant challenges in resolving technical and financial issues swiftly enough to avoid cancellation. The lack of recent progress in resolving the thruster system and the financial strain further diminish the likelihood of the program's continuation without decisive action.\n\nMoreover, NASA's inclination to double-book missions with SpaceX as a contingency indicates a strategic shift towards more dependable providers, potentially sidelining Boeing if improvements are not evident soon. While there is a possibility for Boeing to make necessary adjustments within an extended timeframe, the limited time remaining as of the current date constrains the likelihood of a successful turnaround.\n\n**Probability: 45%**",
