    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill former First Lady of Pakistan Bushra Bibi be arrested before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Bushra Bibi, the wife of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, is arrested before January 1, 2025.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\nBACKGROUND:\nNBC News: [Pakistani troops killed as protesters storm barricades demanding the release of jailed ex-PM Imran Khan](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/pakistan-protests-imran-khan-troops-killed-islamabad-violence-rcna181774)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Bushra Bibi being arrested before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Legal Status\n- Non-bailable arrest warrants have been issued against Bushra Bibi by a Rawalpindi accountability court due to her failure to appear in court for eight consecutive hearings in a corruption case involving GBP 190 million[2][3][5].\n\n## Recent Attempts at Arrest\n- On November 23, 2024, a team from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and police attempted to arrest her at her residence in Peshawar but were unsuccessful as she was not present[1][3][5].\n\n## Ongoing Investigations and Cases\n- Bushra Bibi and her husband, Imran Khan, are accused of misusing PKR 50 billion (GBP 190 million) that was returned to Pakistan by the UK’s National Crime Agency. These funds were allegedly meant for the national treasury but were redirected for personal benefits and to establish Al-Qadir University[2][3][5].\n\n## Political and Social Context\n- Bushra Bibi resides in Peshawar, where Imran Khan's political party, PTI, holds power. This could potentially influence the enforcement of the arrest warrants[1][3].\n\n## Additional Legal Complications\n- Besides the GBP 190 million corruption case, there are other cases against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi, including vandalism during protests in Islamabad, which might complicate the arrest process[4].\n\nGiven these points, while there are active efforts to arrest Bushra Bibi and legal grounds for her arrest, the success of these efforts depends on various factors such as her availability, the effectiveness of the law enforcement agencies, and any potential political or legal interventions.\n\n### Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- The history of similar cases in Pakistan suggests that the process of arresting high-profile individuals can be complex and sometimes delayed due to various legal and political reasons.\n- The fact that previous attempts to arrest her were unsuccessful indicates that there might be ongoing efforts to evade or delay the arrest.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The current political climate in Pakistan, with Imran Khan and his party being in a state of conflict with the government, could influence the timing and success of the arrest.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Similar cases involving high-profile individuals in Pakistan have often seen delays and legal battles that can extend the time to resolution.\n\nIn conclusion, while the legal framework supports the possibility of her arrest, the actual outcome depends on several variables, including her availability, legal maneuvers, and the political environment. Therefore, it is not immediately clear whether she will be arrested before January 1, 2025.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bushra Bibi missed any scheduled court appearances in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Bushra Bibi has missed scheduled court appearances in 2024. According to the sources, an accountability court issued non-bailable warrants against her because she missed eight consecutive hearings[1][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there active arrest warrants for Bushra Bibi issued by Pakistani courts?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThere are active arrest warrants for Bushra Bibi issued by Pakistani courts. An accountability court in Islamabad issued non-bailable arrest warrants for her due to her continuous absence from court hearings in the £190 million corruption case[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bushra Bibi been apprehended by law enforcement authorities since November 23, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nSince November 23, 2024, attempts have been made to arrest Bushra Bibi, but she has not been apprehended. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and police visited her residence in Peshawar on November 23, but she was not present at the time[1][2][5].\n\nAdditionally, the Peshawar High Court has granted her transit bail until December 23, which further indicates that she has not been arrested[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Bushra Bibi currently residing in Peshawar?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Bushra Bibi is indeed residing in Peshawar after her release from Adiala Jail. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- Bushra Bibi arrived in Peshawar after being released from Adiala Jail and is staying at the Chief Minister's House in Peshawar[1][2][4].\n- PTI leaders and officials have confirmed that she will stay in Peshawar instead of going to Lahore[1][2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any change in the political power held by PTI in Peshawar since November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information regarding a change in the political power held by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in Peshawar since November 2024. The sources focus on the protests, the November 24 rally, and the subsequent events, but they do not provide details about any shifts in political power or control in Peshawar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any successful arrests of high-profile individuals in Pakistan in the last six months?\nANSWER: YES\n\nIn the last six months, there have been significant arrests of high-profile individuals in Pakistan. For example:\n\n- Nearly 1,000 protesters, including supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan, were arrested in Islamabad during protests calling for his release[1][3][4].\n\n- Additionally, the former director general of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, was taken into custody by the Pakistan Army in connection with a private housing scheme scandal[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any legal appeals filed to delay the arrest of Bushra Bibi?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been legal appeals and measures taken to delay or prevent the arrest of Bushra Bibi.\n\n- In the £190 million graft case, Bushra Bibi had requested an exemption from attending the court hearings on medical grounds, which led to the issuance of a non-bailable arrest warrant. However, she was granted protective bail by the Peshawar High Court, extending it till December 23, which directed law enforcement agencies not to arrest her till then in any of the cases[1].\n\n- Additionally, in the iddat case, Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan filed appeals against their conviction, which involved arguments and legal proceedings that delayed the final verdict and any potential arrest related to that case[2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the National Accountability Bureau have the resources to execute an arrest warrant for Bushra Bibi?\nANSWER: Yes, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has the resources to execute an arrest warrant for Bushra Bibi. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- NAB has the enforcement powers that include the issuance of arrest warrants, as stated in the National Accountability Ordinance and other documents[3][4].\n- Specifically, NAB can issue non-bailable arrest warrants, as seen in the case of Bushra Bibi where such warrants were issued for her non-appearance in court[5].\n- NAB can also seek assistance from other authorities, such as the Interior Ministry, for the execution of arrest warrants, as evident from the case of Imran Khan's arrest[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence that Bushra Bibi has taken measures to evade arrest authorities?\nANSWER: Yes, there is evidence suggesting that Bushra Bibi has taken measures or been involved in situations that indicate an attempt to evade arrest authorities.\n\n1. **Non-Attendance in Court Hearings**: Bushra Bibi has been absent from court hearings, leading to the issuance of a non-bailable arrest warrant against her. This continuous absence was cited as a reason for the warrant, implying she was \"deliberately not appearing in court\"[1].\n\n2. **Protective Bail and Exemptions**: She has been granted protective bail and has requested exemptions on medical grounds, which could be seen as measures to avoid immediate arrest[1].\n\n3. **Fleeing the Scene During Protests**: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif alleged that during the protests, Bushra Bibi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur fled the scene after clashes erupted, indicating an attempt to avoid arrest or confrontation with security forces[3][4].\n\nThese instances collectively suggest that Bushra Bibi has taken steps to avoid or evade arrest authorities.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there ongoing public support for Bushra Bibi that might protect her from arrest?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is significant public support for Bushra Bibi, which could potentially influence her situation regarding arrest.\n\n- Bushra Bibi has emerged as a central figure in the protests demanding the release of her husband, Imran Khan, and her involvement has garnered substantial public support. Her address to the protesters and her insistence on holding the protest at a central location in Islamabad have rallied a large number of supporters[1][3].\n- Analysts have noted that her relationship to Imran Khan gives her a level of authenticity and appeal to the protesters, which has helped in mobilizing large numbers of people[1][3].\n- The public admiration for her, particularly after her near-year-long imprisonment, has contributed to her popularity and the support she receives from PTI supporters[1].\n\nWhile this public support does not guarantee that she will not be arrested, it suggests that any attempt to arrest her could face significant public backlash and resistance, which might make the authorities more cautious in their actions. Therefore, the ongoing public support could potentially offer some protection or at least complicate any efforts to arrest her.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n27 days (from December 4, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current circumstances remain unchanged, Bushra Bibi would **not** be arrested by January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 7 days left, the probability of arrest would be **10%**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith around 4 months left, the probability of arrest would increase to **50%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the limited time frame of 27 days until January 1, 2025, several factors influence the probability of Bushra Bibi's arrest:\n\n1. **Active Arrest Warrants:** Non-bailable warrants have been issued against her for multiple missed court appearances, indicating a clear legal mandate for her arrest.\n\n2. **Previous Evasion Attempts:** Past unsuccessful attempts to arrest her suggest that she has both the means and possibly the support to evade law enforcement efforts.\n\n3. **Political and Social Support:** Residing in Peshawar, where Imran Khan's PTI holds significant influence, may provide her with protective leverage. Additionally, substantial public support could deter authorities from making aggressive arrest attempts due to potential backlash.\n\n4. **Legal Complications:** Ongoing legal appeals and protective bail extend the timeline for any enforcement actions, reducing the likelihood of an immediate arrest within the remaining 27 days.\n\n5. **Law Enforcement Capabilities:** While the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) possesses the resources to execute arrest warrants, the combination of legal protections and political influence may impede swift action.\n\n6. **Time Sensitivity:** With only 27 days left, there is limited window for law enforcement to navigate legal hurdles, mobilize resources effectively, and execute an arrest without significant resistance.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a clear legal basis for her arrest, practical challenges and external support mechanisms significantly lower the probability within the short remaining period.\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
