    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations for the United States for the week of Dec 7, 2024 be more than 2,000?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThese questions will resolve as the weekly total number of confirmed influenza hospitalizations in the United States for the week ending on Dec 7, 2024, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), currently anticipated to be posted at [this dataset](https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub/blob/main/target-data/target-hospital-admissions.csv) from the FluSight Forecast Hub.\n\nThe value used for resolution will be the number shown in the \"value\" column in target-hospital-admissions.csv with \"location_name\" as \"US\" and the \"date\" corresponding to the relevant week end date.\n\nThe CDC uses \"epidemiological weeks\" which begin on Sunday and end on Saturday. To allow for data revisions and reporting delays, this question will resolve according to data shown at the resolution source 4 weeks after the respective end date.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nForecasters please note two things:\n\n-  At the time of this question's launch, the CDC has not yet begun updating the FluSight Forecast Hub dataset with numbers from the 2024-25 season. \n\n- There is some uncertainty about where the resolution data will be. If the CDC publishes the data at a different location than the one listed above, Metaculus Admins will issue a clarification updating the question accordingly.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the CDC, 0.4% of all deaths in the United States from October 2023 to August 2024 [had](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/flu-summary-2023-2024.html#cdc_generic_section_8-mortality-surveillance) influenza listed as an underlying or contributing cause. At its height, for the week ending January 6, 2024, 1.3% of all deaths in the US stemmed from influenza. In the past decade and a half, the CDC [estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/about/faq.html#cdc_tools_technologies_features-flu-related-hospitalization) that flu has, with the exception of the outlier year 2020, resulted in 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations per year. \n\nOver the wide sweep of history, much of the [fat tail risk](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0921-x) from pandemics has come from influenza. Since 1900, the start of the [late modern medicine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9609744/) era, the deadliest pandemic faced globally [was](https://openpublichealthjournal.com/contents/volumes/V14/TOPHJ-14-128/TOPHJ-14-128.pdf) the 1918 Spanish Flu. It was caused by [H1N1](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html) and killed an estimated 2%-3% of the world's population. Other notable influenza pandemics occurred in [1957](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1957-1958-pandemic.html), [1968](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1968-pandemic.html), and [2009](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.htm).\n\nThe CDC runs an annual [FluSight](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/index.html) forecasting exercise, producing an [ensemble forecast](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/flu-forecasts.htm) of weekly influenza hospitalizations compiled from forecasts [submitted](https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub) by a number of teams. The forecasts are compared to the \"gold standard\" flu hospitalization data, [described by the CDC here](https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub/tree/main/target-data), compiled from the underlying data [here](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh). The data used is from `Field 34` of the source data, described in the [guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf) as follows:\n\n>Information Needed: Previous dayâ€™s admissions with laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection\n\n>Description: Enter the total number of patients (adult and pediatric) who were admitted to an inpatient bed on the previous calendar day who had laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection at the time of admission. Include inpatient, overflow, observation, ED, ED awaiting orders for an inpatient bed, active surge/expansion, ICU, NICU, PICU, newborn and nursery\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations for the United States for the week of December 7, 2024, will be more than 2,000, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context and Seasonal Patterns\n- Influenza activity and hospitalization rates typically follow a seasonal pattern, with peaks usually occurring between December and February.\n- The 2023-2024 season saw peak hospitalizations between December 17, 2023, and January 13, 2024, with a significant decline by May 2024.\n\n## Current Seasonal Activity\n- As of the latest reports, seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally as of early September 2024.\n- However, this does not provide direct insight into the upcoming season's activity.\n\n## Hospitalization Rates\n- Historical data shows that influenza-associated hospitalization rates can vary significantly across seasons. For example, rates ranged from 8.7 to 102.9 per 100,000 population in pre-COVID-19 seasons.\n- During the 2023-2024 season, there were approximately 25,000 to 40,000 hospitalizations reported, depending on the source and time frame considered.\n\n## Age and Demographic Factors\n- Hospitalization rates are highest among adults aged 65 years and older, followed by children aged 0 to 4 years.\n\n## Predictive Factors\n- The timing and intensity of influenza seasons can be influenced by various factors, including vaccination rates, circulating virus strains, and other respiratory disease activities.\n\nGiven these points, it is challenging to predict with certainty whether the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations for the week of December 7, 2024, will exceed 2,000 without current data on the 2024-2025 season. Here are some considerations:\n\n- **Base Rates**: Historical data suggests that peak weeks can see significant hospitalization numbers, but the exact timing and magnitude can vary.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The influenza season typically peaks in late December to early February, so December 7 might be on the cusp of increasing activity.\n- **Current State**: As of the latest reports, there is no specific data available for the 2024-2025 season to make a precise prediction.\n\nWithout specific data for the 2024-2025 season, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the weekly total will be more than 2,000. However, historical trends suggest that it is plausible for hospitalization numbers to rise significantly during peak season weeks.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the CDC reported early signs of increased influenza activity or outbreaks in the United States as of November 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nAs of November 2024, the CDC has not reported early signs of increased influenza activity or outbreaks in the United States. The reports indicate that seasonal influenza activity remains low nationally, with stable and low levels of influenza virus positivity and emergency department visits for influenza.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have multiple states in the United States reported widespread influenza activity as of early November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or reports for influenza activity in the United States as of early November 2024. The sources primarily discuss the 2023-2024 influenza season, which ended in May 2024, and do not provide real-time or current data for the 2024-2025 season as of early November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the CDC reported that influenza hospitalization rates in the United States are higher in November 2024 compared to the same period in previous years?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not contain specific data on influenza hospitalization rates for November 2024 compared to the same period in previous years. The reports from the CDC discuss the current and past influenza seasons, but the data for November 2024 is not explicitly compared to previous years in the provided sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the CDC issued a warning about an early or severe influenza season for 2024-2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the CDC has issued a warning about an early or severe influenza season specifically for the 2024-2025 season.\n\n- The sources discuss the recommendations for the 2024-2025 flu season, including the transition to trivalent flu vaccines and the importance of vaccination, but they do not mention any warnings about an early or severe season.\n- The information provided focuses on the vaccine composition, vaccination recommendations, and general surveillance strategies, without any specific warnings about the severity or timing of the upcoming flu season.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the predominant influenza strains circulating in the 2024-2025 season associated with increased disease severity?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not contain information about the disease severity associated with the predominant influenza strains circulating in the 2024-2025 season. They focus on the recommendations for the composition of influenza vaccines for the 2024-2025 season, the exclusion of the B/Yamagata lineage virus, and the specific virus strains recommended for inclusion in trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines, but they do not discuss the severity of the disease caused by these strains.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the influenza vaccination rate in the United States for the 2024-2025 season lower than in previous years?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not contain specific data or comparisons regarding the influenza vaccination rate for the 2024-2025 season relative to previous years. They discuss recommendations, vaccine composition, and general guidelines for the 2024-2025 influenza season, but they do not provide vaccination rate comparisons.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have COVID-19 related public health measures, such as mask mandates or social distancing, been largely discontinued in the United States by November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that while the strict public health measures such as mask mandates and social distancing have been significantly relaxed, they have not been completely discontinued.\n\nThe White House's National COVID-19 Preparedness Plan indicates that the use of public health mitigation measures like masking is recommended but will be less frequent, suggesting a more targeted and less widespread use of these measures.\n\nThe CDC's new community snapshot and other updates also suggest a shift towards more nuanced and localized guidance, rather than blanket mandates. However, the plan still includes recommendations for masks and other precautions in certain situations, indicating that these measures are not entirely discontinued.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are hospitalizations for other respiratory illnesses, like RSV or COVID-19, unusually high in the United States in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the answer is **NO**, hospitalizations for other respiratory illnesses like RSV or COVID-19 are not unusually high in the United States in November 2024.\n\n- The CDC reports that as of November 1, 2024, the amount of acute respiratory illness causing people to seek healthcare is low nationally, and COVID-19 activity is declining in most areas.\n- While there are signs of increased RSV activity in the southern and southeastern United States, particularly in young children, the overall national trend for respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and RSV, is not indicated to be unusually high.\n- Another source confirms that this yearâ€™s respiratory season in the U.S. appears to be in decline, with most indicators trending down after a late surge in December.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did countries in the Southern Hemisphere experience a severe influenza season during their 2024 winter?\nANSWER: The severity of the 2024 influenza season in the Southern Hemisphere varied by region and country, but it was not uniformly severe across all areas.\n\n- In South America, countries like Chile, Ecuador, and Uruguay experienced high levels of flu activity and severe disease, particularly with the H3N2 strain.\n- In the African region, Zambia reported an early start to the season and very high levels of illness and severe disease, primarily with the H1N1 strain.\n- In the Oceania region, Australia's flu season was described as moderate and similar to pre-COVID years, with activity decreasing in recent weeks.\n\nWhile some countries experienced high levels of severe disease, the overall characterization of the season as \"severe\" is not consistent across all regions. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations in the United States exceed 2,000 during the week ending December 7 in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic?\nANSWER: To determine if the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations in the United States exceeded 2,000 during the week ending December 7 in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to look at historical data on influenza hospitalizations.\n\nThe sources provided do not offer specific weekly data for the exact week ending December 7, but they do provide some context and aggregate data that can help infer the answer.\n\n1. **CDC Data**: The CDC tracks influenza hospitalizations, but the provided link does not offer specific weekly data for the week ending December 7. However, it does provide annual and seasonal averages which can be used to estimate weekly rates.\n\n2. **Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations**: Studies and reports indicate that influenza-associated hospitalizations can vary significantly by season and virus type. For example, during some seasons, the annual averages of influenza-associated hospitalizations can be quite high, especially among certain age groups.\n\nGiven the lack of specific weekly data for the week ending December 7, we cannot definitively say whether the number exceeded 2,000 for that exact week. However, we know that during peak influenza seasons, hospitalization rates can be high enough that a weekly total of over 2,000 is plausible.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\nFrom today's date, November 5, 2024, until the resolution date (which is four weeks after December 7, 2024), there are approximately **60 days** remaining. The outcome will be known around January 4, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf current conditions persist, with influenza activity remaining low and no significant uptick in cases, the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations for the United States for the week of December 7, 2024, would likely be **less than 2,000**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith only 15 days left until the outcome (around November 20, 2024), and if influenza activity remains low with no emerging signs of a surge, I would forecast a **15% probability** that hospitalizations would exceed 2,000 for that week.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nIf there were 240 days left (extending into July 2025), the increased uncertainty about future influenza activity would lead me to forecast a **35% probability** that hospitalizations would exceed 2,000 for the week in question, accounting for potential late-season surges or unexpected trends.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current State of Influenza Activity:** As of November 2024, the CDC reports that influenza activity remains low nationally. There are no indications of early increases in flu cases, outbreaks, or unusual patterns that would suggest an imminent surge.\n  \n- **Historical Patterns:**\n  - **Seasonal Timing:** Influenza activity typically starts to increase in late November or December, peaking between December and February. However, significant hospitalization numbers often emerge later in the season.\n  - **Hospitalization Data:** In recent years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, weekly influenza hospitalizations exceeding 2,000 for the week ending December 7 were not common unless there was an early and severe flu season.\n  \n- **Base Rates and Mechanisms:**\n  - **Typical Hospitalization Rates:** Without specific data, it's challenging to pinpoint exact numbers, but base rates suggest that early December hospitalizations are usually below the 2,000 threshold in average flu seasons.\n  - **Factors Affecting Severity:** No predominant influenza strains known for increased severity are reported for the 2024-2025 season. Vaccination rates are presumed to be consistent with previous years, and public health measures have not drastically changed.\n  \n- **Uncertainties and Risks:**\n  - **Potential for Rapid Change:** Influenza activity can sometimes increase rapidly due to factors like viral mutations or changes in public behavior, but there are no current indicators of such developments.\n  - **External Influences:** Other respiratory illnesses, like RSV or COVID-19, are not reported to be unusually high, reducing the likelihood of compounded stress on the healthcare system that might indirectly influence flu hospitalizations.\n  \n- **Conclusion:** Given the current low influenza activity, historical trends, and lack of indicators for an early or severe flu season, it is **unlikely but possible** that hospitalizations will exceed 2,000 for the week ending December 7, 2024. Therefore, I estimate the probability to be moderately low.\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
