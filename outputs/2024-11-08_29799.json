    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of active US oil drilling rigs exceed 590 on November 29, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-08\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of active oil drilling rigs exceeds 590 on November 29, 2024, according to the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count, which can be accessed at [this](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_rotary_rigs) Ycharts link.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe link will be accessed by Metaculus Admins on or around November 30, 2024. In case of its inaccessibility, the secondary resolution source will be from Baker Hughes itself at [this link](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count). If both resolution links remain inaccessible by the end of the tournament, the question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBaker Hughes [issues](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/) US oil rig counts every Friday, and issued oil rig counts to the petroleum industry since 1944.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the number of active US oil drilling rigs exceeding 590 on November 29, 2024, here are some key points and trends from the available data:\n\n## Current Rig Count\nAs of the latest reports, the total active drilling rig count in the US is 585, with 481 oil rigs and 101 gas rigs.\n\n## Recent Trends\n- The rig count has been relatively stable in recent weeks, with minor fluctuations. For example, the total rig count increased by 1 to 586 in the week ending October 11, 2024, but then remained at 585 in subsequent weeks.\n- There has been a general decline in the rig count over the year. In October 2024, the total rig count was down from 625 a year ago.\n\n## Forecast and Analyst Views\n- Analysts predict that the US onshore rig count will remain relatively flat in 2024, with some forecasts indicating a slight decrease from 2023 levels. John Spears of Spears and Associates forecasts an average active onshore rig count of 674 in 2024, down from 697 in 2023.\n- The Permian Basin, a key oil-producing region, has seen some stability but is expected to benefit more significantly from new gas pipelines coming online in the latter half of 2024 and into 2025.\n\n## Economic and Market Factors\n- Oil prices have been volatile but generally lower than the highs seen in previous years. As of October 2024, oil prices were around $71.78, which is lower than the $80 range that could support stronger rig activity.\n- Natural gas prices, which also influence drilling decisions, have been low due to excess supply, although they have slightly recovered from their lows earlier in the year.\n\nGiven these points, the likelihood of the rig count exceeding 590 by November 29, 2024, seems low based on current trends and forecasts. The rig count has been stable but trending downward, and there are no strong indicators suggesting a significant increase in the near term.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historical data shows that significant increases in rig counts are often driven by substantial changes in oil or gas prices, or major improvements in drilling technology and infrastructure. Currently, such drivers are not prominently evident.\n- The current rig count is already below last year's levels, and forecasts suggest stability or slight decreases rather than increases.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- Any changes in rig counts due to new infrastructure, such as gas pipelines, are expected to take months to accrue, making an immediate increase by November 29, 2024, less likely.\n\nIn summary, while it is not impossible for the rig count to exceed 590 by November 29, 2024, the current trends and forecasts do not strongly support this outcome.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current number of active US oil drilling rigs significantly below 590 as of today?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 1, 2024, the current number of active US oil drilling rigs is 479, which is significantly below 590.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the number of active US oil drilling rigs increased by more than 100 rigs in a three-week period at any time in the past decade?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or mention of a three-week period where the number of active US oil drilling rigs increased by more than 100 rigs in the past decade.\n\n- The sources provide various snapshots and trends of rig counts, but they do not detail specific three-week periods of significant increases.\n- The closest information is about weekly and longer-term changes, but these do not meet the specific criteria of a three-week period with an increase of over 100 rigs.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent geopolitical event causing a major disruption in global oil supply?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence of a recent geopolitical event causing a major disruption in global oil supply.\n\n- The sources discuss various geopolitical tensions and their potential impacts on oil markets, but they do not indicate any recent major disruptions. For example, the CSIS article mentions the escalating turmoil in the Middle East but notes that oil prices remain stable despite these tensions.\n- The S&P Global Commodity Insights article highlights that despite geopolitical conflicts, there have been no significant crude supply hiccups or major disruptions to physical trade flows in the Asian oil market.\n- The European Central Bank's economic bulletin discusses the general impact of geopolitical shocks on oil prices but does not specify any recent major disruptions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have analysts predicted a substantial increase in US oil drilling rigs for November 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources provided do not indicate a substantial increase in US oil drilling rigs predicted for November 2024. Instead, they highlight various trends and forecasts that suggest a stable or declining rig count:\n\n- The total U.S. oil rig count has been declining year-over-year and over the past few months.\n- The Permian Basin, while still a significant contributor, has seen a decline in rig counts from its post-pandemic peak.\n- The overall U.S. rig count has been easing over the last three months, with a year-over-year decline.\n\nThere is no mention of a substantial increase in oil drilling rigs for November 2024 in the provided sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the recent trend in US oil drilling rig counts showing a significant upward trajectory?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the recent trend in US oil drilling rig counts does not indicate a significant upward trajectory.\n\n- As of the latest data, the US Oil Rig Count is at 479, which is down from 480 the previous week and down from 504 one year ago.\n- The total rig count has also shown a stable or slightly declining trend over the recent months. For example, the total rig count was 585 as of November 1, 2024, which is down from 625 one year ago.\n\nThese figures suggest that the number of active oil rigs has not been increasing significantly in recent times. Instead, there has been a slight decline or stability in the numbers.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming policy changes or government incentives that would likely increase US oil drilling activity in the next three weeks?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are indications of upcoming policy changes that could increase US oil drilling activity, although the specific timeline of the next three weeks is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n- President-Elect Trump is expected to reduce the time it takes to approve drilling permits on public lands by half and increase permit applications to drill on federal land, which would likely increase oil drilling activity.\n- Trump plans to end the Biden Administration's \"pause\" on new LNG export permits and reduce regulatory burdens and costs on oil and gas exploration, development, and transportation, further facilitating increased drilling activity.\n\nWhile these changes are anticipated to occur in the initial days and weeks of the Trump Administration, the sources do not specify exact timelines. However, given the intent to implement these changes early in the administration, it is reasonable to infer that such policies could be enacted within the next three weeks.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have oil prices experienced a significant surge in recent weeks that would incentivize increased drilling?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, oil prices have indeed seen an increase in recent weeks, which could potentially incentivize increased drilling.\n\n- As of November 7, 2024, WTI crude oil futures were around $72.29 per barrel, and Brent crude was at $75.59 per barrel, with both showing weekly gains.\n- The OPEC+ decision to extend production cuts and delay output increases supported an upward price movement. Specifically, Brent crude rose by about 2.5% and WTI crude by about 2.9% compared to the previous week.\n- These increases are attributed to various factors, including the OPEC+ supply decision, the US Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, and increased economic activity in the US and China.\n\nGiven these recent price increases, it is reasonable to conclude that oil prices have experienced a significant surge that could incentivize increased drilling.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any announced plans by major oil companies to significantly increase drilling activities before November 29, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no specific announcements or plans from major oil companies to significantly increase drilling activities before November 29, 2024.\n\n- The sources indicate that the U.S. drilling activity is expected to remain flat or see only minor increases in 2024. For example, the rig count is forecast to stay below 700 for the remainder of 2024, and overall U.S. drilling is predicted to increase by only 0.6% in 2024.\n- There are mentions of upcoming pipeline projects that could impact drilling activity, but these effects are expected to be felt more significantly in 2025 rather than before the end of 2024.\n- While there are some positive indicators and expectations for long-term growth, there are no immediate plans for a significant increase in drilling activities before November 29, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a historical instance where US oil rig counts increased by over 20% within a month?\nANSWER: To determine if there has been a historical instance where US oil rig counts increased by over 20% within a month, we need to examine the historical data on oil rig counts.\n\nHistorical data from sources such as Baker Hughes and other energy reports indicate significant fluctuations in oil rig counts over the years, particularly in response to changes in oil prices and drilling technologies.\n\n- In the mid-2010s, there was a significant rebound in oil rig counts after a sharp decline. For example, after reaching a low of 404 active drilling rigs in May 2016, the rig counts started to rise as oil prices recovered and drilling technologies improved.\n- However, specific monthly increases of over 20% are not commonly reported in the provided sources. The sources do mention significant year-over-year changes, such as a 33% increase in 2022, but these are not monthly increases.\n\nGiven the available data, there is no explicit mention of a month where the US oil rig counts increased by over 20%. Therefore, based on the provided sources, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any technological advancement or new discovery prompting an immediate increase in US oil drilling?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several technological advancements and factors contributing to the immediate increase in US oil drilling and production.\n\n1. **Advances in Hydraulic Fracturing and Horizontal Drilling**: These technologies have revolutionized the industry by unlocking vast oil reserves in shale formations, particularly in areas like the Permian Basin and the Bakken Formation. These techniques have significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of oil extraction processes.\n\n2. **Improved Drilling Productivity**: Enhancements in drilling processes, such as longer lateral lengths, optimized well spacing, and enhanced fracturing designs, have led to greater well productivity. This means producers can extract more oil from existing fields, often at a lower cost.\n\n3. **Data Analytics and Automation**: The integration of advanced data analytics and automation has further enhanced the efficiency of drilling operations, reducing costs and minimizing environmental impact. Technologies like Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) are being used to optimize processes, improve decision-making, and enhance predictive maintenance.\n\n4. **Infrastructure Expansion**: The expansion of pipelines, refineries, and export terminals has made it easier to transport and process large volumes of oil, supporting higher production levels and facilitating the U.S.’s rise as a major crude oil exporter.\n\nThese technological advancements and infrastructure developments are key drivers behind the current surge in US oil production.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are **21 days** remaining until November 29, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends continue without significant change, the number of active US oil drilling rigs would remain below 590 on November 29, 2024. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **5 days** left (a quarter of the remaining time), the likelihood of the rig count exceeding 590 would be even lower. The forecast probability of the question resolving as **Yes** would decrease slightly.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith **84 days** remaining (four times the current time left), there would be more opportunity for market changes. However, given current trends and forecasts, the probability of the rig count exceeding 590 would increase only marginally.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe current number of active US oil drilling rigs is significantly below 590. As of the latest data in early November 2024, the US oil rig count stands at **479**, down from **504** a year ago. The total rig count, including gas rigs, is **585**, which is still below the threshold of 590 even when combined.\n\n**Recent Trends:**\n\n- **Declining Rig Counts:** The number of active rigs has been declining over the past year. This downward trend is attributed to several factors, including market saturation, technological efficiencies reducing the need for more rigs, and cautious investment strategies by oil companies.\n\n- **Stable Oil Prices:** Oil prices have been relatively stable but are not high enough to incentivize a significant increase in drilling activity. Current prices around **$72 per barrel** are lower than the $80+ levels typically associated with ramped-up drilling.\n\n- **Analyst Forecasts:** Industry analysts predict that the US rig count will remain flat or decline slightly in 2024. Forecasts suggest that the average active onshore rig count will be lower than in 2023.\n\n**Market and Economic Factors:**\n\n- **Supply and Demand Dynamics:** Global oil supply exceeds demand due to slower economic growth and efforts toward renewable energy. This limits the incentive to increase drilling operations significantly in the short term.\n\n- **Geopolitical Stability:** There have been no recent geopolitical events causing major disruptions in global oil supply that would necessitate a rapid increase in US drilling.\n\n**Technological Advancements:**\n\nWhile technological advancements like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling have boosted US oil production over the past decade, there are no recent breakthroughs prompting an immediate increase in drilling activity within the next three weeks.\n\n**Infrastructure and Policy:**\n\n- **Infrastructure Projects:** Upcoming infrastructure projects, such as new pipelines, are expected to impact drilling activity, but these effects will materialize in late 2024 and into 2025, beyond the question's timeframe.\n\n- **Policy Changes:** There are no announced policy changes or government incentives slated to take effect before November 29, 2024, that would significantly boost drilling activity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the current rig counts, declining trends, lack of significant market drivers, and the short timeframe until November 29, it is unlikely that the number of active US oil drilling rigs will exceed 590.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
