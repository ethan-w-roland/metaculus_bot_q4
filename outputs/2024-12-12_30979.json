Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf there is a tie when looking at dollar values of their net worths, this resolves as **No**. If the resolution source is unavailable on December 31, 2024, resolution will wait until it is available (at which point it resolves based on the data shown), until January 3, 2025, at which point this question will be **annulled**.

Therefore, it is highly likely that Michael Jordan's net worth will exceed that of Howard Schultz on December 31, 2024, assuming there are no significant changes in their respective wealth in the remaining days of 2024.\n\nThis conclusion is clear and does not require speculation, as the current net worth values are well-documented and show a substantial difference in favor of Michael Jordan.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Howard Schultz sold any major assets since December 11, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information indicating that Howard Schultz has sold any major assets since December 11, 2024.

    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n19 days (from December 12, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf nothing changed, Michael Jordan's net worth would remain at $3.5 billion, and Howard Schultz's net worth would stay at $3.4 billion. Thus, Michael Jordan's net worth would exceed that of Howard Schultz.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 5 days remaining, the likelihood that either individual's net worth would change significantly enough to alter the current standings remains low. Therefore, the probability that Michael Jordan's net worth exceeds Howard Schultz's would still be high, around 85%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith an extended timeframe of about 76 days, there would be more opportunities for financial fluctuations, investments, or other factors to influence net worth. However, given the short actual timeframe of 19 days until December 31, this scenario serves as a theoretical reference. Over a longer period, the probability might slightly decrease due to increased uncertainty, but within the 19-day window, the impact remains minimal.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAs of December 12, 2024, Michael Jordan's net worth stands at $3.5 billion, while Howard Schultz's is at $3.4 billion. The 19-day period until December 31 is relatively short, making significant fluctuations in net worth unlikely. The only noted factor that could influence this outcome is the ongoing legal issues affecting Michael Jordan's finances. However, without specific details on the potential financial impact of these legal matters, it's reasonable to assume that they are unlikely to drastically reduce his net worth by more than $100 million in such a brief period. Additionally, there have been no indications of substantial changes to Howard Schultz's net worth that would offset the current $100 million difference. \n\nConsidering the current standings and the short time frame, the probability remains high that Michael Jordan's net worth will exceed Howard Schultz's by the end of the year.\n\n**Probability:** 85%",
