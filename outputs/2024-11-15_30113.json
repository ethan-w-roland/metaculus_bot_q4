    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the International Criminal Court issue any warrants in November or December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-15\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, after November 11, 2024, and before January 1, 2025, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issues a warrant of arrest for any individual, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If there are no reports of the ICC issuing any arrest warrants during that period, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nSummonses to appear will not count. For more information please see the ICC's [How the Court works](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/how-the-court-works), especially the following, under *Investigations*:\n\n>After gathering evidence and identifying a suspect, the Prosecution requests ICC judges to issue:\n>1. an arrest warrant: the ICC relies on countries to make arrests and transfer suspects to the ICC; or\n>2. a summons to appear: suspects appear voluntarily (if not, an arrest warrant may be issued).\n\nSecret warrants will only resolve as Yes if they are publicly and officially disclosed by a credible source before January 1, 2025. Anonymous or unsourced reporting that such a warrant has been issued will not be sufficient. If a secret arrest warrant is issued before January 1, 2025, but not publicly known until after that, it will not count.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe [International Criminal Court (ICC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court) was founded in 2002 following the wars in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, and it is [intended](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/29/icc-israel-warrants-gaza/) as a permanent court to investigate war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity done by individuals. It issued its first arrest warrants in 2005, and as of October 2024, it [has indicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_indicted_in_the_International_Criminal_Court) a total of 63 individuals.\n\nAs the ICC [explains](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/how-the-court-works) on its official website, an arrest warrant is requested by the Prosecutor as part of the investigative stage before trial, especially in cases in which suspects do not appear voluntarily. In May 2024, the ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan [filled applications](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-prosecutor-karim-aa-khan-kc-applications-arrest-warrants-situation-state) for warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as the now-dead Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif, and Ismail Haniyeh. As of 11 November 2024, no warrants for these individuals have been issued.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue any arrest warrants in November or December 2024, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Current Proceedings and Timeline\n- The ICC's Prosecutor, Karim Khan, recently applied for arrest warrants on May 20, 2024, against Israeli and Hamas leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The decision on these warrants is pending and could take several months, as has been the case in previous applications[3][4].\n\n## Decision Process\n- The Pre-Trial Chamber needs to examine the evidence and decide whether to issue the warrants. This process can be lengthy, and there is no fixed timeline for the decision. Historically, such decisions have taken several months to a year or more[3].\n\n## Ongoing Cases and Workload\n- The ICC is currently handling a high volume of cases and has an unprecedented demand for its work. This includes ongoing trials, confirmation of charges hearings, and other proceedings. The Court's President, Tomoko Akane, highlighted the busy period and the challenges in executing arrest warrants due to the lack of cooperation from states[5].\n\nGiven these points, it is not possible to definitively say whether the ICC will issue any arrest warrants in November or December 2024. The decision process is ongoing, and the timeline for such decisions can be unpredictable. Therefore, the answer to this question is not immediately clear based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any significant updates in the ICC's investigations since November 11, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no updates mentioned that specifically occur after November 11, 2024. The sources discuss events and developments up to October 2024, but do not include any information about significant updates in the ICC's investigations after that date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the ICC made any public statements indicating a decision on the May 2024 warrant applications is imminent?\nANSWER: No, the sources provided do not indicate that the ICC has made any public statements suggesting that a decision on the May 2024 warrant applications is imminent. The sources detail the filing of the applications for arrest warrants by the ICC Prosecutor but do not mention any timeline or indication of an imminent decision from the Pre-Trial Chamber[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any ICC officials indicated that the decision on the May 2024 warrants may be delayed beyond December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit statement from ICC officials indicating that the decision on the May 2024 warrants will be delayed beyond December 2024. The sources discuss various factors contributing to the delays, such as the submission of *amicus curiae* briefs, challenges to the court's jurisdiction, and external pressures, but they do not specify a timeline extending beyond December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber expedited the review process for the May 2024 arrest warrant applications?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information that directly addresses whether the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber expedited the review process for the May 2024 arrest warrant applications. The sources discuss general procedures and rules of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) arbitration, but they do not provide details about the specific case or the timing of the review process for the May 2024 arrest warrant applications.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there recent news reports suggesting that the ICC is close to issuing new arrest warrants as of November 15, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are recent news reports suggesting that the ICC is actively considering and in the process of issuing new arrest warrants as of November 15, 2024.\n\n- The ICC Prosecutor, Karim Khan KC, has applied for arrest warrants against Hamas leaders and Israeli officials, which indicates ongoing efforts to issue new warrants[2][3].\n- On 4 October 2024, the ICC unsealed six arrest warrants in the Libya situation, and there are plans for additional arrest warrants across several priority lines of inquiry in Libya[1][5].\n\nThese developments indicate that the ICC is indeed close to or in the process of issuing new arrest warrants.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the ICC issued arrest warrants in November or December in previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of the ICC issuing arrest warrants exclusively in November or December in previous years. However, the sources do provide examples of arrest warrants being issued in other months and the general process of how warrants are handled.\n\nFor instance, the sources mention that arrest warrants were issued in February 2023 for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, and in May 2024, applications were made for arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders[3][4][5].\n\nSince there is no explicit information about November or December, the answer to whether the ICC has issued arrest warrants in these months in previous years is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any member states increased their cooperation with the ICC regarding the individuals named in the May 2024 applications?\nANSWER: The information provided does not directly address whether any member states have increased their cooperation with the ICC specifically regarding the individuals named in the May 2024 applications for arrest warrants.\n\nHowever, there are indications of general support and cooperation from various states. For example, on 15 June 2024, 93 States issued a joint statement reaffirming their support for the ICC's independence and integrity, and vowing to preserve it from political interference and pressure[5].\n\nWhile this shows a broad commitment to supporting the ICC, it does not specifically mention increased cooperation related to the May 2024 applications.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the ICC ever issued secret arrest warrants that were publicly disclosed within the issuance period?\nANSWER: Yes, the ICC has issued arrest warrants that were initially kept secret but later publicly disclosed.\n\nIn the cases involving individuals from the situation in Ukraine, the ICC issued arrest warrants that were initially secret to protect witnesses and safeguard the investigations. However, the Court later authorized the public disclosure of these warrants to prevent further commission of crimes.\n\nFor example, in the cases against Sergei Ivanovich Kobylash and Viktor Nikolayevich Sokolov, as well as against Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova, and against Sergei Kuzhugetovich Shoigu and Valery Vasilyevich Gerasimov, the ICC judges decided that public awareness of the warrants could contribute to the prevention of further crimes and thus authorized their public disclosure[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the ICC currently experiencing delays due to a high volume of cases in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the ICC is currently experiencing delays and challenges due to several factors, including a high volume of cases.\n\n- The ICC President, Tomoko Akane, mentioned an \"unparalleled increase in demand for the Court’s work\" and highlighted the Court's \"extraordinarily busy period\" over the past 12 months, with numerous ongoing cases and new arrest warrants issued[1].\n- The Court faces criticism for its slow pace of justice, with investigations and trials often taking years to complete, which is exacerbated by the high volume of cases and limited resources[3].\n- Specific cases, such as those related to the situation in Palestine, have been delayed significantly, contributing to the overall perception of slow justice and inefficiency[4].\n\nThese points indicate that the ICC is indeed experiencing delays partly due to the high volume of cases it is handling.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the International Criminal Court ever issued an arrest warrant within six months of a prosecutor's application?\nANSWER: Yes, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued arrest warrants within six months of a prosecutor's application.\n\nFor example, in the case of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, the ICC Prosecutor submitted applications for arrest warrants on February 22, 2023, and the warrants were confirmed just 23 days later, on March 17, 2023[3].\n\nAnother instance is the arrest warrant for the former President of the Ivory Coast, Laurent Koudou Gbagbo, which was issued 30 days after the prosecutor's application on November 23, 2011[3].\n\nThese examples demonstrate that the ICC can issue arrest warrants well within a six-month timeframe following the prosecutor's application.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nThere are 46 days remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed from the current situation, the outcome would be **No**—the International Criminal Court (ICC) would not issue any arrest warrants in November or December 2024.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately 11.5 days left until January 1, 2025, my forecast for the ICC issuing any arrest warrants during the specified period would be **lower**, due to the reduced time for developments.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nIf there were about 184 days remaining until January 1, 2025 (hypothetically extending the time frame), my forecast for the ICC issuing arrest warrants in November or December 2024 would be **slightly higher**, as more time allows for additional information and developments that could indicate imminent warrants.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe ICC has historically issued arrest warrants within a range of timeframes after a prosecutor's application. Notably:\n\n- In some cases, arrest warrants have been issued within 23 days (e.g., the warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova in 2023).\n- In other instances, it has taken several months to over a year for warrants to be issued.\n\nGiven that the ICC Prosecutor applied for arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders in May 2024, we are now six months past that application. This is within the historical window where warrants could be issued.\n\nRecent developments suggest that the ICC is actively working on issuing new arrest warrants:\n\n- On October 4, 2024, the ICC unsealed six arrest warrants in the Libya situation and indicated plans for additional warrants.\n- Reports indicate that the ICC is close to issuing new arrest warrants as of November 15, 2024.\n\nHowever, there are factors that may delay the issuance of new warrants:\n\n- The ICC is experiencing a high volume of cases and unprecedented demand for its work, which could slow down proceedings.\n- There are no public statements from the ICC indicating that a decision on the May 2024 warrant applications is imminent.\n- Delays are common in ICC proceedings due to challenges such as gathering sufficient evidence, political considerations, and the need for judicial review by the Pre-Trial Chamber.\n\nConsidering the above, there's a reasonable chance that the ICC will issue at least one arrest warrant in November or December 2024. The combination of the time elapsed since the applications, historical precedents of warrant issuance timelines, and recent activity in other cases supports this probability.\n\nAdjusting for uncertainties:\n\n- If we had only a quarter of the time left (about 11.5 days), the likelihood would decrease because there would be less time for necessary procedures to conclude.\n- If we had four times the time left (extending to May 2025), the probability would increase slightly, as more developments could lead to warrant issuance within the specified period.\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
