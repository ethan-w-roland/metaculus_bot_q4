    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the 2024 World Chess Champion be decided in the first 10 games?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-08\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if either player in the 2024 World Chess Championship match reaches 7.5 points before the 11th classical game (e.g. by winning 5 games and drawing another 5).\n\nThis question will also resolve as **Yes** if for any other reason the 2024 Chess Champion is declared by FIDE before the 11th classical game is played (e.g. a player forteits the match or is disqualified during the match).\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n* If the match is played by any other players than Ding Liren and Gukesh Dommaraju, the question will be **Annulled**.\n* If the result of the game 10 is not known by 7 January 2025 (and the 2024 Chess Champion is still not declared by that date) the question will resolve as **Ambiguous**.\n* If the results of one or more of the first 10 games are annulled, then these games are not included in the count of the games for the resolution. This includes the case when both players receive 0 points for the game for violating Fair Play policy.\n* If the 2024 Chess Champion title is later revoked (e.g. due to revealed fact of cheating), it will not affect the question resolution.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe [World Chess Championship 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_2024) match between the reigning world champion Ding Liren (Rating: 2728 as of 1 Nov 2024) and the challenger Gukesh Dommaraju (Rating: 2783 as of 1 Nov 2024) is set to take place between 25 November and 13 December 2024, in Singapore.\n\nAs of November 1st, 2024, Ding Liren is [23rd in the world](https://2700chess.com/), but was in the top 5 for 6 consecutive years, reaching as high as #2, with his top rating being the 12th highest in the history of chess. He also [used to have](https://en.chessbase.com/post/ding-liren-profile-2024-fide) the longest unbeaten streak of 100 games, until Carsen surpassed it. Gukesh D has his own [set of achievements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gukesh_Dommaraju), being the third-youngest grandmaster in history, the third-youngest to reach a chess rating of 2700, the youngest to reach a rating of 2750, the youngest Candidates Tournament winner and the youngest contender to compete for the World Championship.\n\nThe match will be best of 14 games; a score of at least 7½ would win the world championship. If the score is equal after 14 games, tiebreak games with faster time controls will be played. \n\nIn chess a win is 1 point and a draw is ½ point with a high tendency towards draws at the highest level.\n\nThe time control for each game in the classical portion of the match is 120 minutes per side for the first 40 moves and 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment per move starting with move 41.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the 2024 World Chess Champion will be decided in the first 10 games, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Match Format\nThe 2024 FIDE World Championship Match will consist of 14 classical games. The player who scores 7.5 points or more wins the match. If the score is equal after 14 games, tie-breaks will be played.\n\n## Time Control and Game Schedule\nEach game follows a time control of 120 minutes for the first 40 moves, followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment starting from move 41. The schedule includes 14 game days interspersed with rest days, with only four rest days in total.\n\n## Scoring and Winning Conditions\nFor the champion to be decided in the first 10 games, one player must achieve a score of 7.5 points or more within those games. Given the scoring system, this would mean that one player must win at least 7.5 points out of the first 10 games, which is highly improbable but not impossible.\n\n## Historical Context\nIn previous World Chess Championships, it has been rare for the match to be decided before all scheduled games are played, especially given the high level of competition and the strategic nature of the game. However, the new regulations aim to encourage more decisive games by offering bonuses for wins and using faster time controls.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile it is theoretically possible for the 2024 World Chess Champion to be decided in the first 10 games, it is not likely given the competitive balance and the strategic depth of chess at this level. The match is more likely to go the full 14 games or even to tie-breaks.\n\nBased on the information available, the question cannot be clearly answered as yes or no without speculation. The outcome depends on the performance of the players, and there are too many variables to predict with certainty whether the champion will be decided within the first 10 games.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any indications that Ding Liren might forfeit or be disqualified from the 2024 World Chess Championship?\nANSWER: There are no indications in the provided sources that suggest Ding Liren might forfeit or be disqualified from the 2024 World Chess Championship. The sources discuss his recent form, health issues, and mental state, but they all confirm that he intends to defend his title against Gukesh in the upcoming championship.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any indications that Gukesh Dommaraju might forfeit or be disqualified from the 2024 World Chess Championship?\nANSWER: There are no indications in the provided sources that suggest Gukesh Dommaraju might forfeit or be disqualified from the 2024 World Chess Championship. All the sources discuss his preparation, recent performances, and the upcoming match against Ding Liren without mentioning any potential issues that could lead to forfeiture or disqualification.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any World Chess Championship match in recent history concluded before game 11 due to a player reaching the required points?\nANSWER: Yes, there has been a World Chess Championship match in recent history that concluded before game 11 due to a player reaching the required points.\n\nIn the 2021 FIDE World Chess Championship, Magnus Carlsen won the match by achieving a score of 7.5-3.5 against Ian Nepomniachtchi, which meant the match concluded before the 11th game was necessary.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Ding Liren experienced a significant decline in performance or rating in 2024 leading up to the championship?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nDing Liren has experienced a significant decline in his performance and rating since his victory in the 2023 World Chess Championship. This is indicated by several sources:\n\n- His rating has been falling with every event since he started active preparation for the World Championship match in January 2023.\n- There is a mention of a \"notable dip in his performance, with his rating and ranking falling significantly\" since his victory.\n\nThese points suggest that Ding Liren has indeed experienced a decline in both performance and rating leading up to the 2024 World Chess Championship.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do matches between players of similar top-level rankings typically result in a high number of draws?\nANSWER: YES, matches between players of similar top-level rankings in chess typically result in a high number of draws. Here are some key points that support this:\n\n- At the top level, players are often evenly matched, leading to a higher likelihood of draws. This is because both players are highly skilled and can avoid making significant mistakes that would lead to a decisive outcome.\n\n- The draw rate increases with the level of the players. For example, games between players with Elo ratings above 2600 show a consistent and high draw rate, often around 50% or more.\n\n- Top-level players often play more cautiously to avoid losses, which can result in more draws. Factors such as health issues, tournament strategy, and the desire to conserve energy also contribute to the higher draw rates among top players.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has either Ding Liren or Gukesh Dommaraju dominated their recent opponents with a high number of decisive wins?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that neither Ding Liren nor Gukesh Dommaraju has recently dominated their opponents with a high number of decisive wins, at least not in the context described.\n\nFor Ding Liren, the sources indicate that he has been struggling lately. He has a streak of 28 classical games without a win, with zero wins, 21 draws, and seven losses.\n\nWhile Gukesh Dommaraju is described as being in top form and having had a fantastic year, the specific mention of his recent performance is limited to his success in the Chess Olympiad where he scored 9/10, but this does not provide a comprehensive view of his recent matches against various opponents.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has either player exhibited a consistently aggressive playing style leading to fewer draws in recent tournaments?\nANSWER: The question pertains to chess players and their playing styles, particularly in the context of aggression and the frequency of draws in recent tournaments.\n\nFrom the source provided, here are some key points:\n\n- Top chess players have indeed adopted more aggressive playing styles in recent years, with players like Caruana, Nakamura, and others contributing to a more aggressive and exciting style of play.\n- The abolition of the \"Grandmaster Draw\" and the requirement to reach move 30 before a draw can be agreed upon have led to fewer draws, down from 66% to 50%.\n- Players like Anand, Shirov, Nakamura, and others are known for their aggressive attacking styles, which contribute to fewer draws and more decisive outcomes.\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that some top chess players have exhibited consistently aggressive playing styles, which has led to fewer draws in recent tournaments.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Gukesh Dommaraju shown a significant improvement in performance or rating in 2024 leading up to the championship?\nANSWER: Yes, Gukesh Dommaraju has shown a significant improvement in performance and rating in 2024 leading up to the championship.\n\n- He won the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament, becoming the youngest player in history to achieve this feat, which is a significant performance milestone.\n- During the Candidates Tournament, he achieved a rating performance of 2847 across the 14 rounds, indicating a high level of performance.\n- Following his success at the 2024 FIDE Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Gukesh broke into the world top-five for the first time on the October 2024 FIDE rating list, gaining 30 rating points with a gold medal performance of 3056.\n- His rating gains have also increased the gap between him and the current World Chess Champion, Ding Liren, by a significant margin.\n\nThese achievements and rating improvements highlight a substantial enhancement in his performance and standing in the chess world.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been changes in the 2024 World Chess Championship rules that encourage more decisive games?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe 2024 FIDE World Championship rules have indeed been modified to encourage more decisive games. Here are some key changes:\n\n- **Time Controls**: The time controls for classical games have been adjusted to two hours for the first 40 moves, followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with a 30-second increment starting from move 41. This is faster than the previous format, which had additional 60 minutes at move 40 and 15 minutes at move 60.\n\n- **Prize Fund Distribution**: The prize fund of $2.5 million will be distributed in a way that incentivizes playing for wins. Each player will receive $200,000 for every game they win, and the rest will be split equally. This is a change from the previous system where the match winner received 60% of the prize fund and the runner-up received 40%.\n\n- **Tie-Break Format**: The tie-break system has been adapted to favor shorter games with a gradual decrease in time controls. It starts with 15-minute rapid games, followed by 10-minute rapid games if needed, and then blitz games. This is designed to be more exciting and to encourage more decisive outcomes.\n\nThese changes are intended to promote more decisive games and reduce the likelihood of draws.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any external factors that could cause the championship match to end before the 11th game?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several external and internal factors that could cause a championship match or any game to end before its natural conclusion, depending on the sport and its specific rules.\n\n## Forfeits and Player Availability\nIn sports like basketball, a game can end early if a team has fewer than the required number of players due to injuries, fouling out, or ejections. For example, in FIBA tournaments, if a team has fewer than two players ready to play, the game is forfeited.\n\n## External Conditions\nGames can be abandoned or ended early due to external conditions such as weather, COVID-19 issues, or other safety concerns. For instance, in the 2021 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, a game was declared a no-contest due to COVID-19 quarantine issues, allowing the unaffected team to advance via walkover.\n\n## Safety and Conduct\nIn football (soccer), if a team is reduced to fewer than seven players during the game due to red cards and/or injuries, the game must be abandoned.\n\n## Other Rules\nIn various sports, rules about match postponement, player injuries, or equipment issues can also lead to a game being terminated or rescheduled. For example, in baseball, if a match is suspended and cannot be completed within 24 hours, the selections may be voided.\n\nThese factors can all contribute to a championship match ending before its scheduled conclusion.",
    "comment": "**(a)** Time left until the outcome to the question is known:\n\nAs of November 8, 2024, the World Chess Championship match is scheduled to take place between November 25 and December 13, 2024. This means the outcome will be known in approximately **35 days**.\n\n---\n\n**(b)** What the outcome would be if nothing changed:\n\nIf nothing changed, it is **unlikely** that the 2024 World Chess Champion will be decided in the first 10 games. Historically, matches between top-level players like Ding Liren and Gukesh Dommaraju tend to have a high number of draws, and the match would likely extend beyond game 10 or proceed to tie-breaks.\n\n---\n\n**(c)** What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:\n\nWith only about **9 days** left until the outcome is known, my forecast would remain largely **unchanged**, as there would be minimal new information affecting the likelihood of the match being decided within the first 10 games.\n\n---\n\n**(d)** What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:\n\nIf there were approximately **140 days** left until the outcome is known, there would be more time for unexpected events to occur (e.g., injuries, withdrawals), but barring such events, my forecast would still remain **similar**, as the fundamental factors influencing the outcome wouldn't change significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Precedence:** World Chess Championship matches between evenly matched grandmasters often have a high proportion of draws. For example, previous matches have frequently gone the full distance or required tie-breaks to determine the winner.\n\n- **Player Styles and Recent Performance:**\n  - **Ding Liren** has experienced a decline in performance and rating leading up to the championship. However, he remains a highly skilled and resilient player with extensive experience at the highest level.\n  - **Gukesh Dommaraju** has shown significant improvement, climbing into the world top five and demonstrating strong performances in recent tournaments. However, he is newer to this level of competition and may face pressures associated with his first World Championship match.\n\n- **Match Dynamics:**\n  - For the championship to be decided in the first 10 games, one player needs to reach a score of **7.5 points** before game 11. This would require a combination of decisive wins and few draws.\n  - The high tendency toward draws at this level makes it statistically less likely for a player to achieve 7.5 points within 10 games.\n\n- **External Factors:**\n  - No current indications suggest that either player will forfeit or be disqualified, which could otherwise lead to an early conclusion of the match.\n\n- **Rule Changes Encouraging Decisive Play:**\n  - While changes in the 2024 World Chess Championship rules aim to encourage more decisive games (e.g., adjusted time controls, prize incentives for wins), this may not be sufficient to significantly alter the likelihood of an early match conclusion between such closely matched opponents.\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
