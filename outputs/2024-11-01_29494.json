    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Apple earnings for Q3 2024 exceed $1.60 per share?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis questions resolves as **Yes** if the reported diluted earnings per share of Apple, Inc., for the third quarter of 2024 are >$1.60, based on the earnings report estimated to be released on November 7, 2024.  If they are less than or equal to that number, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nOnly GAAP diluted earnings per share will be considered. Should the date of the earnings announcement be moved, resolution will be on that date. For purposes of this question, Q3 2024 is considered to be the the three-month period ending soonest to September 30, 2024, regardless of when Q3 2024 ends from the perspective of the company's fiscal year.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nConsensus earnings estimates are for an average of $1.60 per share, according to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/analysis/). \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information available, Apple's earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 (which is often referred to as Q4 in the context of Apple's fiscal year, but here it seems to be confused with Q3 in some sources) have already been reported.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n- Apple reported adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share for the quarter, which exceeded analyst expectations of $1.60 per share.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Apple's earnings for the reported quarter exceeded $1.60 per share is **yes**. However, it is important to note that the reporting period in question is Apple's fiscal fourth quarter, not the third quarter, as some sources might suggest due to a mix-up in terminology.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple announced its earnings for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, prior to November 1, 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nApple announced its financial results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, which ended on September 28, 2024, on October 31, 2024. This announcement was made before November 1, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple historically exceeded earnings estimates in recent quarters?\nANSWER: Yes, Apple has historically exceeded earnings estimates in recent quarters. According to the sources, Apple has consistently performed well in this regard:\n\n- Apple marked the sixth consecutive quarter that the firm exceeded earnings estimates, highlighting its consistent performance.\n- The company's adjusted EPS of $1.64 exceeded analyst expectations of $1.60 for the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nThese points indicate that Apple has a recent history of exceeding earnings estimates.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the overall technology sector experiencing growth that could positively impact Apple's earnings in this quarter?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no direct information about the overall technology sector's growth and its potential impact on Apple's earnings. The sources focus on Apple's specific financial results, product updates, and investor reactions, but do not provide a broader analysis of the technology sector as a whole.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Apple report GAAP diluted earnings per share greater than $1.60 in the same quarter last year?\nANSWER: No, Apple did not report GAAP diluted earnings per share greater than $1.60 in the same quarter last year.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, which ended on September 30, 2023, Apple reported a GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.47. This is less than $1.60.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are analysts' consensus estimates for Apple's GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, greater than $1.60?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the actual GAAP diluted earnings per share for Apple for the quarter ending September 30, 2024, is $0.97.\n\nThere is no information in the sources provided about analysts' consensus estimates for Apple's GAAP diluted earnings per share for this quarter. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the analysts' consensus estimates are greater than $1.60.\n\nThe answer is: **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple provided guidance indicating earnings per share greater than $1.60 for the quarter ending September 30, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nApple reported diluted earnings per share of $0.97 for the quarter ending September 28, 2024, and when excluding a one-time income tax charge, the earnings per share were $1.64. However, there is no indication in the provided sources that Apple has given guidance for future quarters that would suggest earnings per share greater than $1.60 for the specific quarter ending September 30, 2024. The guidance provided is for the December quarter, not the quarter that just ended.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any significant change in Apple's share count that could affect diluted earnings per share calculations?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been significant changes in Apple's share count that could affect diluted earnings per share calculations.\n\nApple has been actively engaged in share repurchase programs, which have led to a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. For example, the average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter that ended in June 2024 was 15,348 million, which is lower than previous quarters.\n\nThis reduction in shares outstanding due to buybacks can impact the calculation of diluted earnings per share, as fewer shares mean higher EPS if net income remains constant or increases. The sources highlight the importance of considering these changes in share count to accurately forecast and calculate EPS.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major disruptions or negative events affecting Apple's operations in the quarter ending September 30, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there was a significant disruption affecting Apple's operations, although it did not occur exactly within the quarter ending September 30, 2024, but rather just before it.\n\nOn August 27, 2024, Apple experienced temporary outages affecting several of its services, including the Mac App Store, Apple Books, Find My, Game Center, iCloud Mail, iWork for iCloud, Apple News, and Stocks. These outages were resolved by August 28, 2024.\n\nThere is no mention in the sources of any major disruptions or negative events specifically affecting Apple's operations within the quarter ending September 30, 2024. Therefore, the answer to whether there were major disruptions or negative events within that specific quarter is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant positive product launches or events for Apple during the quarter ending September 30, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several significant positive product launches and events for Apple during the quarter ending September 30, 2024.\n\n- Apple launched the iPhone 16 lineup, which includes the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro Max, all of which feature various upgrades such as larger displays, improved cameras, and the new A18 Bionic chips.\n- The Apple Watch Series 10 was released, featuring larger screen sizes, a thinner design, and potential health monitoring improvements.\n- New AirPods 4 models were introduced, with USB-C charging cases, updated stem designs, and features like noise cancellation and Find My support for the higher-end model.\n- The AirPods Max received new color options, although a full update to AirPods Max 2 with USB-C charging and other features is also anticipated.\n- Additionally, the black titanium Apple Watch Ultra 2 was launched.\n\nThese launches were part of Apple's major product event in September 2024, which marked a significant period of new product releases for the company.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple's revenue shown strong growth trends leading up to the quarter ending September 30, 2024?\nANSWER: Apple's revenue has shown some growth, but the trend is not uniformly strong across all periods leading up to the quarter ending September 30, 2024.\n\n- In the fiscal fourth quarter ending September 28, 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, which is a 6% increase from the same quarter a year ago. This is a positive growth indicator.\n- However, the overall annual revenue growth has been more mixed. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023, Apple's revenue was $383.29 billion, which was down 2.80% from the previous year.\n- The revenue growth for the last twelve months up to the quarter ending September 28, 2024, was only 0.43% year-over-year.\n\nTherefore, while the specific quarter ending September 28, 2024, showed strong growth, the broader annual and recent twelve-month trends have been more modest.\n\n**YES**, for the specific quarter, but **UNCLEAR** for the overall trend leading up to it. However, given the context of the question, the most accurate answer would be:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of November 1, 2024, the earnings report for the quarter ending September 28, 2024, has already been released on October 31, 2024. Therefore, the outcome is currently known.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nBased on the reported GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) of **$0.97**, which is less than or equal to $1.60, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were still a short period before the earnings release, considering the consensus estimates of $1.60 per share and Apple's history of exceeding estimates, I might have forecasted a moderate probability of the EPS exceeding $1.60â€”perhaps around **60%**.\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith more time before the earnings announcement, and factoring in potential positive impacts from new product launches and market trends, I might have slightly increased the probability to around **65%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven that Apple's GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter ending September 28, 2024, is reported at **$0.97**, which is below the threshold of $1.60, the question is set to resolve as **No**. GAAP figures are standard and seldom subject to significant revisions post-announcement unless major errors are found, which is rare.\n\nHistorically, Apple has often exceeded earnings estimates and has had strong product launches that positively impact earnings. However, the substantial difference between the actual GAAP EPS and the threshold suggests that, despite positive business activities, the GAAP EPS did not meet the expected level.\n\nConsidering these factors, and the fact that the outcome is already known, the probability that the question resolves as **Yes** is extremely low.\n\n**Probability: 1%**",
