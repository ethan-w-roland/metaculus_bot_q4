    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Kalshi outrank the Wells Fargo Mobile App in the top free Finance apps on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-14\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, on December 31, 2024, according to the Apple App Store at [this link](https://apps.apple.com/us/charts/iphone/finance-apps/6015?chart=top-free), on or after December 31, 2024 Kalshi has a higher rank than the Wells Fargo Mobile App when accessed by Metaculus Admins. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. In case of the resolution source being down, Metaculus Admins will wait until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThis question represents an unfolding of events in which Kalshi has spectular near-term success in building its userbase, as surpassing the Wells Fargo app (currently ranked #13) would be considered quite a feat for a prediction market app.  On October 11, 2024, the CEO of Kalshi [tweeted](https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1844770826446319930) that Kalshi's app had surpassed Coinbase in the rankings, in the wake of Kalshi enabling betting on the US election. In addition, Kalshi has also announced it would pay interest on user deposits.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Kalshi outranking the Wells Fargo Mobile App in the top free Finance apps by December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Popularity and User Base\n- The Wells Fargo Mobile App has a significant user base and high ratings, with 4.8 out of 5 stars in both the Apple Store and Google Play Store, based on millions of reviews[4].\n- Kalshi, on the other hand, is a relatively newer and more niche platform focused on prediction markets, which may not have the same broad user base as a major banking app like Wells Fargo.\n\n## Market Presence and Brand Recognition\n- Wells Fargo is a well-established national bank with over 4,000 branches and a strong online presence, which contributes to its app's visibility and usage[4].\n- Kalshi, while innovative in its field, does not have the same level of brand recognition or market penetration as a large financial institution like Wells Fargo.\n\n## App Store Rankings\n- App store rankings are influenced by factors such as user reviews, downloads, and engagement. Given the existing high ratings and large user base of the Wells Fargo app, it would be challenging for a newer app like Kalshi to surpass it in rankings quickly.\n\n## Time Frame\n- The time frame until December 31, 2024, is relatively short, making it even more unlikely for Kalshi to gain enough traction to outrank the Wells Fargo app.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the current information, it is highly unlikely that Kalshi will outrank the Wells Fargo Mobile App in the top free Finance apps by December 31, 2024. The answer to this question is likely \"no,\" given the significant differences in user base, brand recognition, and market presence between the two apps. However, without real-time data on app store rankings and user behavior, this conclusion is based on the available background information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi seen a significant increase in user downloads since enabling betting on the US election?\nANSWER: Yes, Kalshi has seen a significant increase in user downloads since enabling betting on the US election. This is evident from the fact that Kalshi surged to the number one position in the Apple App Store’s free app downloads, pushing other popular apps down the list, following the relaunch of its 2024 presidential election betting market[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Kalshi currently ranked higher than the Wells Fargo Mobile App in the top free Finance apps?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not include any information about Kalshi's ranking in the top free Finance apps, nor do they compare Kalshi's ranking to that of the Wells Fargo Mobile App. The sources focus on the features and reviews of the Wells Fargo Mobile App and financial results of Digital Brands Group, but do not mention Kalshi in this context[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Wells Fargo Mobile App's ranking declining in recent months?\nANSWER: The information provided does not indicate a recent decline in the ranking of the Wells Fargo Mobile App. Here are the key points:\n\n- The J.D. Power 2022 U.S. Banking Mobile App Satisfaction Study ranked Wells Fargo third among national banks, but this data is from 2022 and does not reflect recent months[5].\n- The current reviews and feedback on the App Store, while mentioning some user frustrations and suggestions for improvement, do not provide a comparative ranking over recent months[2].\n\nTherefore, based on the available sources, it is **UNCLEAR** whether the Wells Fargo Mobile App's ranking has been declining in recent months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Kalshi's interest payment on user deposits attracting a large number of new users?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it appears that Kalshi's features, including the interest payment on user deposits, are contributing to its popularity.\n\n- The article from BreakingAC mentions that \"The Kalshi app has recently surged in downloads in the App Store, and for good reason, overtaking brands like Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo.\"[2]\n- The same article highlights several attractive features of Kalshi, including the payment of interest (4.5% APY) on long-term positions, which could be a significant draw for new users[2].\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the interest payment on user deposits is one of the factors attracting a large number of new users.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi's app ranking been increasing significantly over the past few months?\nANSWER: Yes, Kalshi's app ranking has been increasing significantly over the past few months, particularly in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election.\n\n- Prior to October, Kalshi was not very popular and had a relatively low ranking, with only 195K downloads between its launch and the end of September[1][5].\n- However, following a federal court victory in September that allowed it to relaunch its election betting market, Kalshi saw a significant surge in downloads and rankings. By the time of the U.S. presidential election, Kalshi had risen to the number one position in the free app category and the 'Finance' category on Apple's App Store[2][3][4].\n- Just 10 days before the election, Kalshi was ranked 55th in the free app category, indicating a rapid ascent to the top spot[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Wells Fargo faced recent issues that could negatively impact its app's ranking?\nANSWER: Yes, Wells Fargo has faced recent issues that could potentially negatively impact its app's ranking or overall customer trust and satisfaction.\n\n1. **Anti-Money Laundering Deficiencies**: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has identified deficiencies in Wells Fargo's anti-money laundering controls and financial crimes risk management practices, leading to enforcement action that restricts the bank's ability to expand into certain high-risk areas without permission[1][3][4].\n\n2. **Data Breach**: Wells Fargo recently announced a data breach involving a former employee who accessed and used customer information for fraudulent purposes. This breach exposed sensitive customer data, including names, Social Security numbers, addresses, and financial account numbers, which could erode customer confidence and trust in the bank's ability to protect their information[2].\n\nThese issues could negatively impact customer perception and satisfaction, potentially affecting the app's ranking.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are prediction market apps like Kalshi experiencing a surge in popularity in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nPrediction market apps like Kalshi are experiencing a significant surge in popularity in 2024. Here are some key indicators:\n\n- Kalshi and another prediction market, Polymarket, have risen to the top of the Apple App Store’s free app downloads, surpassing popular apps like ChatGPT, TikTok, and Instagram[2][3].\n- The relaunch of Kalshi's 2024 presidential election betting market in early October, following a federal court victory, has contributed to its increased popularity[2][5].\n- The apps have seen substantial betting volumes, with Polymarket recording over $2.8 billion in wagers and Kalshi generating over $500 million in bets on the presidential election[2][3][5].\n- The surge in downloads and betting activity is attributed to the growing interest in election betting, particularly in the lead-up to the 2024 US presidential election[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there major events upcoming that could significantly increase Kalshi's app downloads before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, there are several major events that could potentially increase Kalshi's app downloads before December 31, 2024:\n\n1. **2024 U.S. Presidential Election**: Kalshi is heavily focused on the 2024 presidential election, including markets for the outcome of the election and various related events. This is a significant event that could attract a lot of interest and users[5].\n\n2. **Senate Races**: The platform also offers markets on Senate races, which could draw additional users interested in predicting political outcomes[1].\n\n3. **Other Predictable Events**: Kalshi offers markets on a wide range of other events, including financial markets, economic indicators, court cases, and cultural events like the Grammys and Oscars. These events can also attract users throughout the year[5].\n\nGiven the prominence of these events, especially the presidential election, it is reasonable to conclude that there are indeed major events upcoming that could significantly increase Kalshi's app downloads before December 31, 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Wells Fargo Mobile App introducing new features that could boost its ranking?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThe Wells Fargo Mobile app is indeed introducing several new features aimed at enhancing the user experience and potentially boosting its ranking. Here are some key points:\n\n- A rebuilt mobile banking experience with a new, modern look and feel, and a simpler user interface, set to roll out in early 2022[1].\n- The introduction of an all-new virtual assistant called Fargo, which will provide a concierge-like experience, answer everyday banking questions, and complete tasks for users. Fargo will also surface personalized insights and recommendations to help customers manage their finances better[1][4].\n- Enhanced digital capabilities, including a one-stop-shop Pay & Transfer hub, easier access to products, and improved security features such as 128-bit encryption and biometric authentication[1][3][4].\n- Additional features like mobile check deposit, location services, and the ability to manage accounts, transfer funds, pay bills, and use digital wallets[2][3][4].\n\nThese updates are part of Wells Fargo's multiyear strategy to become digital-first and reinvent digital personal finance, indicating a significant effort to improve the app's functionality and user experience.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any regulatory changes affecting Kalshi that could hinder its growth before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: There are several regulatory developments and ongoing legal battles that could potentially hinder Kalshi's growth before December 31, 2024:\n\n## Ongoing Legal Battle\nKalshi's attempt to offer Congressional Control Contracts is currently embroiled in a legal dispute with the CFTC. The CFTC has appealed the District Court's decision that allowed Kalshi to offer these contracts, and the case is pending before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The Circuit Court has issued an administrative stay, temporarily halting the trading of these contracts pending further legal proceedings[2][4][5].\n\n## Regulatory Review\nThe CFTC has stayed Kalshi's submission for rule amendments related to its trading platform, citing the need for additional time to analyze whether these submissions are consistent with the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations. This review is ongoing and will continue until at least December 23, 2024[3].\n\n## Public Comment Period\nThe CFTC is also conducting a public comment period on proposed amendments to its rules, including those related to event contracts, which could impact Kalshi's operations. This comment period is open until October 28, 2024, and any subsequent changes to the regulations could affect Kalshi's ability to offer certain contracts[3].\n\nGiven these ongoing regulatory and legal issues, there are indeed potential regulatory changes and hurdles that could hinder Kalshi's growth before December 31, 2024.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "Please note that my knowledge cutoff is October 2023, so I cannot account for events that may have occurred after that date. However, based on information available up to October 2023, I can provide an estimate.\n\n---\n\n**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\n- From October 2023 to December 31, 2024, there are approximately **14 months** remaining until the outcome is determined.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\n- If nothing changed from the state of affairs as of October 2023, it is **unlikely** that Kalshi would outrank the Wells Fargo Mobile App in the top free Finance apps by December 31, 2024.\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\n- With only approximately **3.5 months** left, the probability of Kalshi surpassing the Wells Fargo Mobile App would be even **lower**.\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\n- With approximately **56 months** (over 4 years) remaining, there would be more time for Kalshi to grow its user base, potentially **increasing** the probability of outranking Wells Fargo.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Kalshi's Position as of 2023:**\n  - Kalshi is a regulated prediction market platform that, as of October 2023, caters to a niche audience interested in trading on event outcomes.\n  - While innovative, it does not have widespread recognition or a large user base comparable to major financial apps.\n\n- **Wells Fargo Mobile App's Status:**\n  - The Wells Fargo Mobile App is associated with one of the largest banks in the United States.\n  - It has a substantial and established user base, with millions of customers relying on it for daily banking needs.\n  - The app consistently ranks high in the Finance category due to its wide adoption and essential banking services.\n\n- **Market Dynamics:**\n  - Climbing app store rankings, especially in the highly competitive Finance category, requires significant increases in downloads and user engagement.\n  - Apps associated with large financial institutions have a steady influx of users due to existing customer bases.\n\n- **Potential for Kalshi's Growth:**\n  - Unless Kalshi undergoes rapid expansion, significant marketing campaigns, or offers features that attract a broad audience, it is unlikely to surpass the rankings of established banking apps within 14 months.\n  - Regulatory challenges and market acceptance of prediction markets could also impact Kalshi's growth trajectory.\n\n- **Historical Precedents:**\n  - Finance apps that have rapidly climbed the rankings often offer groundbreaking services that appeal to a mass market (e.g., mobile payment apps, stock trading apps with no fees).\n  - Prediction markets remain a relatively niche interest compared to mainstream banking services.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
