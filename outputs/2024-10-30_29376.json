    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Massachusetts voters approve Question 4, which would legalize psychedelic substances for adults 21 years old and older?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-30\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Massachusetts Amendment 4 is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reporting. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Massachusetts Question 4, Legalization and Regulation of Psychedelic Substances Initiative (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Question_4,_Legalization_and_Regulation_of_Psychedelic_Substances_Initiative_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Massachusetts voters approving Question 4, which aims to legalize and regulate the use of natural psychedelic substances for adults 21 years old and older, here are some key points and relevant background information:\n\n## Support and Opposition\n- The campaign in support of Question 4 is led by Massachusetts for Mental Health Options and has received significant funding, over $4 million as of December 31, 2023. The initiative is endorsed by notable organizations and individuals, including the New Approach Advocacy Fund and Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps. Supporters argue that psychedelics can be effective for treating mental health issues such as PTSD and depression.\n\n- The opposition is led by the Coalition for Safe Communities, which raises concerns about public safety, the potential for an unregulated black market, and the risk of harm to children and pets. They also argue that the facilities for psychedelic use may not be staffed by trained medical professionals.\n\n## Public Opinion\n- Recent polls indicate a close and divided public opinion. A University of Massachusetts Amherst/WCVB poll conducted from October 3-10, 2024, showed 43% support, 43% opposition, and 14% undecided. A WBUR & CommonWealth Beacon Poll from September 12-18, 2024, showed 42% support, 44% opposition, and 14% undecided.\n\n## Regulatory Framework\n- If approved, Question 4 would create a Natural Psychedelic Substances Commission and Advisory Board to regulate the licensing, use, and distribution of these substances. It would allow adults 21 and older to use, grow, and possess limited quantities of natural psychedelic substances under specified conditions, including use at licensed facilities and home cultivation in a secured area.\n\n## Legal and Federal Context\n- The legalization of these substances would be in contrast to federal law, which currently classifies all these drugs as illegal. This could potentially lead to federal backlash or legal challenges.\n\n## Comparison with Other States\n- Other states, such as Colorado and Oregon, have already legalized some psychedelics, but the scope of Massachusetts Question 4 is broader, including a wider range of substances and more permissive use conditions.\n\nGiven the close polling numbers, the strong arguments on both sides, and the complex regulatory and legal implications, it is not immediately clear whether Massachusetts voters will approve Question 4. The outcome will likely depend on how voters weigh the potential benefits of psychedelic substances for mental health against the concerns about public safety and regulatory challenges.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the campaign supporting the legalization of psychedelic substances in Massachusetts better funded than the opposition campaign?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not include information about the funding of the campaigns supporting or opposing the legalization of psychedelic substances in Massachusetts. They detail the proposal, the substances involved, and various perspectives on the issue, but they do not address the financial aspects of the campaigns.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Massachusetts previously legalized recreational marijuana through a ballot measure?\nANSWER: Yes, Massachusetts has previously legalized recreational marijuana through a ballot measure. The Massachusetts Legalization, Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Initiative, also known as Question 4, was approved by voters on November 8, 2016, legalizing the recreational use of marijuana in the state.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do recent polls show that a majority of Massachusetts voters support legalizing psychedelic substances for adults 21 years old and older?\nANSWER: Based on the recent polls mentioned in the sources, it does not appear that a majority of Massachusetts voters support legalizing psychedelic substances for adults 21 years old and older.\n\n- A poll conducted by the University of Massachusetts Amherst/WCVB from October 3-10, 2024, showed 43% support, 43% oppose, and 14% undecided.\n- A WBUR & CommonWealth Beacon Poll from September 12-18, 2024, indicated 42% support, 44% oppose, and 14% undecided.\n\nIn both polls, the support does not exceed the opposition, and there is a significant portion of undecided voters.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any medical or mental health organizations in Massachusetts endorsed the use of psychedelic substances for therapeutic purposes?\nANSWER: The endorsement of psychedelic substances for therapeutic purposes by medical or mental health organizations in Massachusetts is not uniform.\n\n- The Massachusetts Medical Society (MMS) has expressed caution and opposition to certain proposals regarding the regulation and taxation of natural psychedelic substances. While they support decriminalization and ongoing research, they do not endorse the use of psychedelic substances as evidence-based treatments outside of approved investigational studies due to concerns about safety, efficacy, and regulatory standards.\n\n- On the other hand, some individual practitioners and organizations, such as the Berkshire Psychedelic Community, which includes licensed mental health professionals, have expressed support and enthusiasm for the therapeutic potential of psychedelic substances like psilocybin and MDMA. These practitioners have undergone training with organizations like the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) and are advocating for the use of these substances in therapeutic settings.\n\nTherefore, while there are individual practitioners and some community organizations that support the therapeutic use of psychedelics, the major medical organization in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Medical Society, has not endorsed it as an evidence-based treatment at this time.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has public opinion in Massachusetts shifted toward more liberal drug policies in recent years?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nPublic opinion in Massachusetts has indeed shifted toward more liberal drug policies in recent years. Here are some key points that support this:\n\n- The decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana in 2008 and the legalization of recreational marijuana in 2016 are significant milestones that reflect a shift towards more lenient drug policies.\n- There is a growing support for harm reduction strategies, such as safe injection sites and needle exchange programs, which indicates a public opinion shift towards addressing drug issues through public health approaches rather than punitive measures.\n- The consideration of Massachusetts Ballot Question 4, which aims to legalize and regulate certain psychedelic substances for therapeutic use, further indicates a willingness to explore more liberal drug policies.\n\nAdditionally, public support for alternatives to incarceration, such as treatment programs and community supervision, is evident from various surveys and policy discussions. These changes and discussions underscore a broader shift in public opinion towards more liberal and rehabilitative drug policies in Massachusetts.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any neighboring states legalized psychedelic substances for adult use?\nANSWER: As of the current information, no neighboring states to Oregon or Colorado have legalized psychedelic substances for adult use in the same manner as Oregon and Colorado.\n\n- Oregon and Colorado are the only states that have legalized the therapeutic use of psilocybin and other psychedelic substances for adult use.\n- Other states, such as California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and others, are considering or have proposed legislation for decriminalization or therapeutic use, but these have not yet been enacted into law.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there major political figures or organizations in Massachusetts publicly endorsing the legalization of psychedelic substances?\nANSWER: Yes, there are major political figures and organizations in Massachusetts publicly endorsing the legalization of psychedelic substances.\n\n- The Cambridge City Council and the Somerville City Council have both endorsed the statewide psychedelics legalization ballot measure, known as Question 4.\n- Governor Maura Healy (D) has drawn attention to and supported a veterans-focused bill that created a psychedelics work group to study the therapeutic potential of substances like psilocybin, although this is not a direct endorsement of the ballot measure.\n- The campaign \"Yes on 4,\" backed by New Approach PAC, which is a group behind previous statewide psychedelic reform campaigns in Oregon and Colorado, is actively promoting the measure.\n- Local advocates and organizations such as Massachusetts for Mental Health Options (MMHO), Parents for Plant Medicine, and Bay Staters for Natural Medicine (though with some reservations about the current form of the bill) are also supporting the initiative.\n\nThese endorsements indicate significant support from both local political bodies and advocacy groups.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the federal government's stance on psychedelic substances influenced state-level decisions in Massachusetts?\nANSWER: The federal government's stance on psychedelic substances has indeed influenced state-level decisions in Massachusetts, although indirectly.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n1. **Federal Prohibition**: Psychedelics are classified as Schedule I substances under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), making their manufacture, distribution, and possession federal crimes. This federal prohibition sets a significant backdrop for state-level decisions.\n\n2. **State and Local Decriminalization**: Despite the federal ban, several cities in Massachusetts, such as Cambridge, have decriminalized the possession of psychedelic substances by deprioritizing enforcement. This move is similar to actions taken in other cities and states, which have chosen to ignore federal laws in favor of local policies.\n\n3. **Legislative Considerations**: State-level reforms, including those in Massachusetts, are often cautious due to the threat of federal crackdowns. States may opt for decriminalization or personal cultivation rather than full commercial legalization to avoid federal prosecution.\n\nIn summary, while the federal government's strict stance on psychedelics has not directly mandated state actions, it has created an environment where states like Massachusetts must navigate around federal laws to implement their own policies.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have ballot measures with similar levels of public support in Massachusetts historically been approved by voters?\nANSWER: To determine if ballot measures with similar levels of public support in Massachusetts have historically been approved by voters, we need to examine past ballot measures and their outcomes.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The history of initiative and referendum in Massachusetts shows that the level of public support can significantly influence the outcome of ballot measures. For example, the 1986 initiative mandating the cleanup of toxic waste dumps, which garnered 73% approval, is one of the most popular initiatives in the state's history.\n\n2. **Public Support and Outcomes**: Measures that have received strong public support have often been approved. For instance, the \"Proposition 2 1/2\" tax cutting initiative and the ban on research on dogs and cats both received significant public backing and were approved.\n\n3. **Contrasting Examples**: However, not all measures with substantial public support have been approved. The 1948 initiative to legalize contraceptives, which received 43% support (though still a significant minority), was ultimately defeated.\n\nGiven these examples, it can be inferred that while strong public support is a positive indicator for the approval of ballot measures, it is not a guarantee. However, measures with high levels of public support are more likely to be approved.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- Ballot measures with high levels of public support in Massachusetts have historically been more likely to be approved by voters, but there are exceptions.\n\n**Answer**:\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant public safety concerns among Massachusetts voters regarding the legalization of psychedelic substances?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are indications of public safety concerns among some individuals and experts regarding the legalization of psychedelic substances in Massachusetts.\n\n- An article from Substack mentions that one of the substances, ibogaine, \"even causes heart attacks\" and expresses concerns that the legalization could exacerbate the mental health crisis, suggesting unregulated use could be dangerous.\n- The discussion on Boston.com includes various perspectives, some of which may highlight potential risks and concerns about public safety.\n- The detailed explanation of the proposed law on Ballotpedia does not specifically address public safety concerns, but the creation of a Natural Psychedelic Substances Commission and Advisory Board to regulate and study the substances implies an acknowledgment of the need for careful management and oversight, which could be related to public safety.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that there are significant public safety concerns raised by some individuals and experts.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a)** Time left until the outcome is known: **6 days** (election on November 5, 2024).\n\n**(b)** If nothing changed, the outcome would likely be **No**—the measure would not be approved.\n\n**(c)** With only a quarter of the time left (about **1.5 days**), the forecast would remain similar, with perhaps a slight decrease in the probability of approval due to limited time for additional campaigning.\n\n**(d)** With four times the time left (about **24 days**), there would be more opportunity for both campaigns to sway undecided voters. The probability of approval might increase slightly due to potential shifts in public opinion.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe most recent polls show a divided electorate with **43% in support**, **43% opposed**, and **14% undecided**. Historically, undecided voters on ballot measures tend to lean towards the status quo, which, in this case, would be a **No** vote.\n\nHowever, Massachusetts has a history of adopting more liberal drug policies:\n\n- In **2016**, Massachusetts voters approved the legalization of recreational marijuana.\n- There is a growing trend toward **liberal drug policies** and support for **harm reduction strategies** in the state.\n\nThe campaign supporting Question 4 is:\n\n- **Well-funded**, with over **$4 million** raised.\n- Backed by notable organizations like **New Approach Advocacy Fund** and **Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps**.\n- Endorsed by some local political figures and organizations, such as the **Cambridge City Council** and **Somerville City Council**.\n\nOpposition concerns focus on:\n\n- **Public safety risks**, including potential harm to children and pets.\n- The lack of trained medical professionals at facilities.\n- The possibility of an **unregulated black market**.\n\nGiven the **close polling numbers** and the significant percentage of **undecided voters**, the outcome is uncertain but leans slightly towards disapproval. The undecided voters are crucial, and with only a few days left, there's limited time for the \"Yes\" campaign to sway them.\n\nIf there were more time (as in scenario d), the \"Yes\" campaign might have a better chance to educate voters about the benefits and safety measures, potentially increasing support.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**Probability: 40%**",
    "probability": 40
