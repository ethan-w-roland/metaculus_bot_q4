    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill China's youth unemployment rate be greater than 18.0 and less than or equal to 19.0 for November 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-13\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve based on the youth unemployment rate for November 2024, as reported by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/youth-unemployment-rate), using data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\nThe question will resolve based on the reported youth unemployment rate, rounded to the nearest 0.1 percentage point.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe youth unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force aged 16-24 without work but available for and seeking employment, based on the calculation method used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China as of August 2024.\n\nIf the National Bureau of Statistics of China revises its calculation method or age range for the youth unemployment rate before September 2024, the question will be resolved using the most up-to-date definition and methodology.\n\nIn the event that Trading Economics does not report the youth unemployment rate for August 2024 before October 7, 2024, or if the data is not available from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the question will resolve as \"Annulled\". The data can be found [directly from the NBS here](https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=A01) by selecting \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate\" under \"Indicators\" on the left side and observing the data in the row labeled \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate of the Population Aged from 16 to 24 Excluding Students(%)\".\n\nBACKGROUND:\nChina's youth unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people aged 16 to 24 who are not in school and are unemployed, has been a growing concern for the country's policymakers and economists. In July 2024, the rate [soared to 17.1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/chinas-youth-unemployment-soars-above-17percent-in-july.html), the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December 2023.\n\nThe new calculation method, introduced in late 2023, excludes those who are still in school, as more people in China are pursuing higher education amid a more competitive job market. Under the previous calculation method, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023.\n\nThe rising youth unemployment rate has been attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes in the labor market. As the issue continues to draw attention, this question aims to predict the youth unemployment rate for August 2024, providing insight into the short-term trajectory of this critical economic indicator.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of China's youth unemployment rate being greater than 18.0 and less than or equal to 19.0 for November 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends\n- The youth unemployment rate in China has been high, reaching 18.8% in August 2024, which is the highest in at least nine months. However, it decreased to 17.6% in September 2024[4][5].\n\n## Historical Context\n- The youth unemployment rate had hit a record high of 21.3% in June 2023, after which China adjusted its calculation method to exclude students, leading to a lower reported rate[3][4][5].\n- The rate has been volatile, with significant increases during economic downturns and seasonal fluctuations, particularly during summer months when new graduates enter the job market[3].\n\n## Economic Conditions\n- China's economy is experiencing a slowdown, with sectors such as real estate, finance, and IT contracting, which typically employ many recent graduates. This has led to reduced hiring and increased youth unemployment[1][3].\n- Consumer and employer confidence are weak, further impacting hiring trends[1][3].\n\n## Educational Trends\n- There is a rising trend of college graduates pursuing postgraduate studies to avoid the competitive job market, which could influence the unemployment rate but does not directly reduce it[2].\n\n## Projections\n- According to Trading Economics, the youth unemployment rate is expected to be around 18.0% by the end of the quarter, with long-term projections suggesting it will remain around 18.0-18.5% in the next couple of years[4].\n\nGiven these points, while the rate has shown some volatility and is influenced by various economic and educational factors, the current trend and projections suggest that the youth unemployment rate for November 2024 could potentially remain in the range of 17.6% to around 18.0%, but it is uncertain whether it will exceed 18.0% and stay below 19.0%.\n\n### Key Factors for Superforecasters:\n- **Base Rates**: The historical average and recent trends indicate a high likelihood of the rate staying above 17% but below 19%.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The rate can fluctuate monthly based on economic conditions and seasonal factors.\n- **Current State of the World**: China's economic slowdown and specific sector contractions are significant influencers.\n- **Reference Classes**: Comparisons with other countries are less precise due to China's adjusted calculation methods[3].\n\nWithout more specific data for November, it is challenging to definitively predict if the rate will be greater than 18.0 and less than or equal to 19.0, but the current and projected trends suggest it is a plausible scenario.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the National Bureau of Statistics of China changed its methodology for calculating youth unemployment since August 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics of China changed its methodology for calculating youth unemployment prior to August 2024. The new methodology, which excludes university students, was implemented after a six-month suspension of youth unemployment data publication that ended in January 2024[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did any major economic events occur in China in November 2024 that could affect youth employment?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about major economic events in November 2024 that could directly affect youth employment in China. The sources discuss economic trends, GDP growth, and various economic indicators up to October 2024, but they do not provide details about specific events in November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China's youth unemployment rate historically increased in November due to seasonal factors?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or mention of the youth unemployment rate in China historically increasing in November due to seasonal factors. The sources do mention that youth unemployment tends to rise every summer, particularly in July, when a large number of graduates enter the job market[4][5], but they do not provide information about November specifically.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Was China's youth unemployment rate above 18.0% in October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the youth unemployment rate in China for October 2024 is not explicitly stated. However, the sources do provide the rates for the preceding months and some forecasts.\n\n- In August 2024, the youth unemployment rate was 18.8%[3][5].\n- In September 2024, the rate decreased to 17.6%[1][4].\n\nThere is no specific data given for October 2024 in the sources provided. Therefore, the answer to whether China's youth unemployment rate was above 18.0% in October 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the projected youth unemployment rate for November 2024 expected to be between 18.0% and 19.0%?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources provided do not indicate that the projected youth unemployment rate for November 2024 is expected to be between 18.0% and 19.0%. In fact, the projections mentioned in the sources suggest that the youth unemployment rate is expected to be around 9.5% to 9.8% in the near future[1][5][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did China's youth unemployment rate decrease from 18.8% in August 2024 to 17.6% in September 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, China's youth unemployment rate decreased from 18.8% in August 2024 to 17.6% in September 2024. This is confirmed by data from the National Bureau of Statistics as reported in several sources[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the Chinese government implement new policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment between September 2024 and November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about new policies implemented by the Chinese government between September 2024 and November 2024 aimed at reducing youth unemployment.\n\n- The sources discuss various policies and measures introduced in 2023 and early 2024, such as the special allowance for employers, the 100-day campaign to find jobs for college graduates, and the 24-point plan to promote high-quality and full employment[2][3][4].\n- However, there is no mention of new policies specifically introduced between September 2024 and November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China's economy shown signs of significant recovery leading up to November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the signs of China's economic recovery leading up to November 2024 are mixed and indicate that any recovery is not significant or sustainable.\n\n- While China's export growth surged in October, rising by 12.7% year-on-year, this growth is attributed to external demand and is seen as temporary due to anticipated trade barriers, particularly from the U.S.[1].\n- The debt relief package of $1.4 trillion is considered a crucial first step, but it does not yet indicate a full recovery[2].\n- Despite ambitious growth targets and some positive indicators like retail sales growth, China's economic recovery remains bumpy. Key sectors such as real estate and private investment continue to struggle, with real estate investment falling by 9.4% and private investment in negative growth territory for the seventh consecutive month[5].\n- The overall economic activity, while showing some acceleration in certain areas, is still hampered by weak domestic demand and other underlying issues[1][5].\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that while there are some positive signs, they are not indicative of a significant or sustainable economic recovery.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major employment sectors for youth, such as technology and manufacturing, increased hiring between September and November 2024?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not contain specific data or information about the hiring trends in major employment sectors such as technology and manufacturing for the period between September and November 2024.\n\n- The sources focus on general trends in youth employment, summer employment statistics, and global youth employment issues, but they do not provide real-time or recent data for the specific time frame of September to November 2024[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether major employment sectors for youth, such as technology and manufacturing, have increased hiring between September and November 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did international economic conditions negatively impact China's economy before November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, international economic conditions did negatively impact China's economy before November 2024.\n\nSeveral sources highlight various international factors that have affected China's economy:\n\n1. **Global Economic Slowdown and Inflation**: The World Economic Outlook updates mention a global economic slowdown, high inflation, and tightening financial conditions, all of which have impacted China's economic performance. For example, the July 2022 update notes a worse-than-anticipated slowdown in China due to global economic conditions and the pandemic[2].\n\n2. **Geopolitical Tensions**: Tensions between the United States and China, as well as global economic fragmentation, have posed significant threats to China's economic development. These tensions have restricted economic access and hindered economic opportunities, particularly for developing economies[4].\n\n3. **Trade Restrictions and Economic Fragmentation**: The IMF estimated that economic fragmentation and increased international trade restrictions could cost the global economy significantly, which in turn affects China's export industries and overall economic growth[4].\n\n4. **Impact of the Ukraine War**: The global economic outlook updates also mention the negative spillovers from the war in Ukraine, which have affected global output, including China's economy[2].\n\n5. **Capital Outflows and Market Confidence**: Large capital outflows from China in 2022 and 2023, along with low confidence in China’s market due to international factors, have further constrained China’s economic growth[1].\n\nThese factors collectively indicate that international economic conditions have indeed had a negative impact on China's economy before November 2024.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThe youth unemployment rate for November 2024 is expected to be released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in mid-December 2024. As of today, November 13, 2024, there is approximately **1 month** until the outcome is known.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends continue without significant changes, the youth unemployment rate is likely to remain around or below **17.6%**, which was the rate in September 2024. This suggests that the rate would be **less than or equal to 18.0%**, and therefore, the question would resolve as **False**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only a quarter of the time left (approximately **1 week**), and considering the recent downward trend in the youth unemployment rate, I would forecast a **low probability** of the rate increasing above 18.0% into the 18.0% to 19.0% range for November 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were four times the time left (approximately **4 months**), the additional time would introduce more uncertainty. Historical fluctuations and potential economic shifts could increase the probability of the rate falling between 18.0% and 19.0%. In that case, I would forecast a **moderate probability**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Recent Trends:**\n  - The youth unemployment rate decreased from **18.8% in August 2024** to **17.6% in September 2024**, indicating a downward trend.\n  - There is no available data for October 2024, but absent significant economic changes, it's reasonable to assume the rate did not substantially increase.\n\n- **Economic Conditions:**\n  - China's economy shows mixed signals with minor improvements but lacks significant recovery.\n  - Key sectors for youth employment, such as technology and manufacturing, have not shown clear signs of increased hiring between September and November 2024.\n\n- **Seasonal Factors:**\n  - Historical data suggests youth unemployment rates peak during the summer months due to new graduates entering the job market.\n  - November does not typically experience seasonal spikes in youth unemployment.\n\n- **Government Policies:**\n  - There have been no major policy implementations specifically aimed at reducing youth unemployment between September and November 2024.\n  - Existing policies may contribute to a gradual decrease in unemployment but are unlikely to cause abrupt changes.\n\n- **Uncertainties:**\n  - Lack of specific data for October and November introduces some uncertainty.\n  - Unexpected economic events or reporting adjustments could impact the rate.\n\nConsidering these factors, while it's possible for the youth unemployment rate to slightly increase, the probability of it being **greater than 18.0% and less than or equal to 19.0%** for November 2024 is **low**.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
