    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations for the United States for the week of Nov 23, 2024 be more than 2,000?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThese questions will resolve as the weekly total number of confirmed influenza hospitalizations in the United States for the week ending on Nov 23, 2024, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), currently anticipated to be posted at [this dataset](https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub/blob/main/target-data/target-hospital-admissions.csv) from the FluSight Forecast Hub.\n\nThe value used for resolution will be the number shown in the \"value\" column in target-hospital-admissions.csv with \"location_name\" as \"US\" and the \"date\" corresponding to the relevant week end date.\n\nThe CDC uses \"epidemiological weeks\" which begin on Sunday and end on Saturday. To allow for data revisions and reporting delays, this question will resolve according to data shown at the resolution source 4 weeks after the respective end date.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nForecasters please note two things:\n\n-  At the time of this question's launch, the CDC has not yet begun updating the FluSight Forecast Hub dataset with numbers from the 2024-25 season. \n\n- There is some uncertainty about where the resolution data will be. If the CDC publishes the data at a different location than the one listed above, Metaculus Admins will issue a clarification updating the question accordingly.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the CDC, 0.4% of all deaths in the United States from October 2023 to August 2024 [had](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/whats-new/flu-summary-2023-2024.html#cdc_generic_section_8-mortality-surveillance) influenza listed as an underlying or contributing cause. At its height, for the week ending January 6, 2024, 1.3% of all deaths in the US stemmed from influenza. In the past decade and a half, the CDC [estimates](https://www.cdc.gov/flu-burden/php/about/faq.html#cdc_tools_technologies_features-flu-related-hospitalization) that flu has, with the exception of the outlier year 2020, resulted in 140,000 to 710,000 hospitalizations per year. \n\nOver the wide sweep of history, much of the [fat tail risk](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0921-x) from pandemics has come from influenza. Since 1900, the start of the [late modern medicine](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9609744/) era, the deadliest pandemic faced globally [was](https://openpublichealthjournal.com/contents/volumes/V14/TOPHJ-14-128/TOPHJ-14-128.pdf) the 1918 Spanish Flu. It was caused by [H1N1](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html) and killed an estimated 2%-3% of the world's population. Other notable influenza pandemics occurred in [1957](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1957-1958-pandemic.html), [1968](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1968-pandemic.html), and [2009](https://archive.cdc.gov/www_cdc_gov/flu/pandemic-resources/2009-h1n1-pandemic.htm).\n\nThe CDC runs an annual [FluSight](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/index.html) forecasting exercise, producing an [ensemble forecast](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/flu-forecasts.htm) of weekly influenza hospitalizations compiled from forecasts [submitted](https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub) by a number of teams. The forecasts are compared to the \"gold standard\" flu hospitalization data, [described by the CDC here](https://github.com/cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub/tree/main/target-data), compiled from the underlying data [here](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh). The data used is from `Field 34` of the source data, described in the [guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf) as follows:\n\n>Information Needed: Previous dayâ€™s admissions with laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection\n\n>Description: Enter the total number of patients (adult and pediatric) who were admitted to an inpatient bed on the previous calendar day who had laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection at the time of admission. Include inpatient, overflow, observation, ED, ED awaiting orders for an inpatient bed, active surge/expansion, ICU, NICU, PICU, newborn and nursery\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations in the United States exceeding 2,000 for the week of November 23, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context\n- During the 2023-2024 influenza season, the cumulative hospitalization rate was the second highest since the 2016-2017 season, with a rate of 80.2 per 100,000 population. However, this rate was spread over the entire season, not concentrated in a single week.\n- Influenza-related hospitalizations have varied significantly across seasons, ranging from 8.7 to 102.9 per 100,000 population pre-pandemic. The peak hospitalization rates typically occur over several weeks rather than in a single week.\n\n## Current Season Activity\n- As of the week ending October 26, 2024, influenza activity in the U.S. was reported to be low, with only 15 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations reported by the FluSurv-NET sites between October 1 and October 5, 2024. The weekly hospitalization rate observed was 0.0 per 100,000 population.\n- Seasonal influenza activity is currently low nationally, with stable and low levels of percent positivity for influenza and emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI).\n\n## Peak Activity Timing\n- Influenza activity typically peaks in late December to early February in the U.S. Based on the 2023-2024 season, peak activity occurred between mid-December and late February.\n\nGiven these points:\n- The current influenza season is still in its early stages, and activity is reported to be low.\n- Historical data suggest that peak hospitalization rates are spread over several weeks and rarely exceed extremely high numbers in a single week.\n- The timing of peak activity is usually later in the season, which would be after the week of November 23, 2024.\n\nBased on this information, it is unlikely that the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations for the United States will exceed 2,000 for the week of November 23, 2024. However, this cannot be definitively answered as a yes or no without real-time data for that specific week.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are hospitalization rates for influenza in early November 2024 significantly higher than in previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data available for the hospitalization rates of influenza in early November 2024. The sources provide detailed information on the 2023-2024 flu season and previous seasons, but they do not extend into the 2024-2025 season or provide real-time data for November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been reports of an unusually early influenza season in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication of an unusually early influenza season specifically for the 2023-2024 season in 2024.\n\n- The CDC report for the 2023-2024 season indicates that influenza activity began to increase in early November and peaked in late December 2023, which is within the typical range for flu seasons.\n- There is no mention of an unusually early start to the flu season in the 2023-2024 reports.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have public health officials issued warnings about a severe influenza season in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit warning from public health officials about a severe influenza season specifically for 2024-2025. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources discuss the general importance of flu vaccination and the composition of the 2024-2025 flu vaccines, but they do not specify that the upcoming season is expected to be severe.\n- The 2023-2024 flu season was described as \"moderately severe,\" but this does not pertain to the 2024-2025 season.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current influenza activity in the United States higher than average for this time of year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- The 2023-2024 flu season in the United States saw influenza activity peak in late December 2023 and then decline, but it remained at elevated levels through February 2024 before decreasing to inter-seasonal levels in May 2024.\n- As of the current time (early November 2024), the sources indicate that flu activity is typically low at the beginning of the flu season, which starts in October. For example, as of September 14, 2024, flu activity was reported to be low.\n- There is no indication in the sources that the current influenza activity (as of early November 2024) is higher than average for this time of year. Instead, it suggests that flu activity usually starts to increase in mid-October or November.\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been increases in influenza-like illness (ILI) reports in the United States in early November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or reports indicating an increase in influenza-like illness (ILI) reports in the United States for early November 2024.\n\n- The CDC report for the 2024-2025 season up to Week 40 (ending October 5, 2024) shows that seasonal influenza activity is low nationally and that the percentage of visits for ILI remained stable and below the national baseline.\n- There is no mention of ILI activity increases in early November 2024 in the sources provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are influenza vaccination rates in the United States lower in 2024 compared to previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the evidence suggests that influenza vaccination rates in the United States have indeed been declining in recent years, including the 2023-2024 season, which is the most recent data available.\n\n- The CDC report for the 2023-2024 flu season indicates that flu vaccination coverage among children (6 months through 17 years) was 55.4%, a decrease of 2.0 percentage points from the 2022-2023 season and 8.3 percentage points from the pre-pandemic 2019-2020 season.\n- For adults, the vaccination coverage was 44.9%, a decrease of 2.0 percentage points from the prior season (46.9%).\n- Additionally, it is mentioned that overall influenza vaccination rates in the U.S. have been in decline for several flu seasons, with the 2023-24 season rate being approximately 35% in some contexts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of significant outbreaks of influenza in any regions of the United States in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence of significant activity related to avian influenza A(H5N1) but not typical seasonal influenza outbreaks in November 2024.\n\nFor avian influenza A(H5N1):\n- There have been confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian flu, with 44 cases reported in the United States as of November 4, 2024, primarily associated with exposure to infected dairy cows and poultry.\n\nFor seasonal influenza:\n- The current seasonal influenza activity is described as low nationally, with stable and low levels of influenza virus detection and emergency department visits for influenza-like illnesses.\n- There is no indication of significant outbreaks of seasonal influenza in any regions of the United States in November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question about significant outbreaks of typical seasonal influenza is:\n\n**NO**\n\nHowever, there are significant outbreaks of avian influenza A(H5N1) in certain regions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any changes in influenza testing or reporting practices that could affect hospitalization numbers in November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been changes in influenza testing and reporting practices that could potentially affect hospitalization numbers in November 2024.\n\n1. **Resumption of Nationwide Hospitalization Data**: The CDC plans to resume collecting nationwide hospitalization data for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV, which had lapsed after a pandemic-era requirement. A new rule by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to start collecting this data again is due to take effect in November, which will be incorporated into the CDC's reporting.\n\n2. **Enhanced Surveillance and Reporting**: There are enhanced surveillance and reporting guidelines, particularly for influenza A subtypes, including avian influenza H5N1. This involves more rigorous testing and subtyping of influenza A positives, which could lead to more accurate and comprehensive data on hospitalizations related to influenza.\n\nThese changes are aimed at improving the accuracy and completeness of the data, which could indeed impact the reported hospitalization numbers in November 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any new influenza strains been identified in 2024 that are more transmissible or severe?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there have been reports of new or notable influenza infections in 2024, but they do not necessarily indicate that these strains are more transmissible or severe in the general population.\n\n1. **Influenza A(H1N2)v Virus**: This variant flu virus was reported in a child in the U.S. who had contact with pigs. While it is a novel infection, it did not show significant person-to-person transmission and the patient recovered.\n\n2. **Avian Influenza A(H5N2) Virus**: A fatal case of human infection with this virus was reported in Mexico. However, this case was isolated, and there was no evidence of person-to-person transmission. The risk to the general population is currently assessed as low by WHO.\n\n3. **B/Yamagata Lineage**: This strain has been absent since March 2020 and has been removed from the 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccine composition. There is no indication of new strains emerging from this lineage.\n\nIn summary, while new cases of influenza infections have been identified, they do not appear to be more transmissible or severe in the broader population at this time.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as to whether they are more transmissible or severe)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the weekly number of influenza hospitalizations in the United States exceeded 2,000 in the week ending November 23 in any of the past five years?\nANSWER: To determine if the weekly number of influenza hospitalizations in the United States exceeded 2,000 in the week ending November 23 in any of the past five years, we need to look at the specific data for those weeks.\n\n### 2019-2020 Season\nFor the week ending November 23, 2019, the CDC reported data that does not specify the exact number of hospitalizations per week but provides rates. However, it does mention that the hospitalization rate for all ages was 2.0 per 100,000, which is typical for that time period. While this does not give the exact number, it suggests that the rates were not unusually high.\n\n### 2020-2021 Season\nThis season was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and influenza hospitalizations were very low, with rates plummeting to 0.8 per 100,000 in 2020. It is unlikely that the number exceeded 2,000 for this week.\n\n### 2021-2022 Season\nThere is no specific data provided for the exact week ending November 23, 2021, but the overall hospitalization rates were returning to pre-pandemic levels. However, without the exact weekly numbers, it is unclear if it exceeded 2,000.\n\n### 2022-2023 Season\nFor the 2022-2023 season, forecasts and reports do not specify the exact weekly numbers for the week ending November 23, 2022. However, the forecasts for new hospital admissions around that time frame were stable and did not indicate a surge that would suggest exceeding 2,000 hospitalizations in a single week.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the available data, it is unclear whether the weekly number of influenza hospitalizations exceeded 2,000 in the week ending November 23 in any of the past five years, as the sources do not provide the specific weekly numbers needed to make this determination.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\nApproximately **46 days**, until December 21, 2024.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf current trends continue, the weekly total number of influenza hospitalizations for the United States for the week ending November 23, 2024 would be **less than 2,000**.\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith about 12 days remaining, and assuming no significant changes, I would forecast a **low probability** that hospitalizations exceed 2,000.\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nWith approximately 184 days left, there's more uncertainty due to potential unforeseen developments, but for the week ending November 23, 2024, it's still **unlikely** that hospitalizations will exceed 2,000.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Trends:** Influenza activity in the United States typically increases in December and peaks between January and February. Late November usually sees lower hospitalization numbers unless there's an unusually early flu season.\n\n- **Recent Early Seasons:** In some recent years, such as the 2022-2023 season, there were early increases in influenza activity with hospitalizations exceeding 2,000 in November. This suggests that while uncommon, early peaks can occur.\n\n- **Current Data (as of November 5, 2024):** Influenza activity remains low nationally. There are no significant increases in influenza-like illness (ILI) reports or hospitalizations. No unusual early influenza activity has been reported.\n\n- **Vaccination Rates:** Declining vaccination rates could contribute to higher transmission. However, without current signs of increased activity, this factor alone doesn't substantially elevate the risk for the specified week.\n\n- **New Strains:** There's no evidence of new influenza strains that are more transmissible or severe circulating at this time.\n\n- **Public Health Surveillance:** Enhanced surveillance efforts and changes in reporting might affect hospitalization numbers, but any significant impact is not apparent currently.\n\nConsidering the above factors, while there's a possibility of an early surge, the probability that hospitalizations will exceed 2,000 for the week ending November 23, 2024 is moderate but less than likely.\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
