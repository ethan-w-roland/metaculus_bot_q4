    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Federal Register list exactly zero executive orders by President Joe Biden for November 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-12\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Federal Register, which can be accessed [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders/joe-biden/2024), lists exactly 0 executive orders for President Joe Biden for the month of November 2024. If it lists >0, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Joe Biden's executive orders and actions](https://ballotpedia.org/Joe_Biden%27s_executive_orders_and_actions)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the Federal Register will list exactly zero executive orders by President Joe Biden for November 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context\nAs of the current data, President Joe Biden has signed 13 executive orders in 2024, as indicated by the Federal Register[1].\n\n## Access to Current Data\nThe Federal Register website is currently restricted due to automated scraping, but it typically provides up-to-date information on executive orders and other presidential documents[2][3][4].\n\n## Predictive Factors\n- **Base Rate**: The base rate of executive orders signed by a president can vary significantly. However, given that President Biden has already signed 13 executive orders in 2024, it suggests he is actively using this executive power.\n- **Time to Resolution**: Since the question pertains to November 2024, there is still time for additional executive orders to be signed before the end of the month.\n- **Current State**: The Federal Register updates its records regularly, but without direct access to the current month's data, it is challenging to confirm the exact number of executive orders for November 2024.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the lack of direct access to the specific data for November 2024 and the historical context that President Biden has been signing executive orders throughout the year, it is not possible to definitively answer whether there will be exactly zero executive orders listed for November 2024. The answer is not immediately clear and would require up-to-date information from the Federal Register.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Joe Biden historically signed executive orders in November during his presidency?\nANSWER: Yes, President Joe Biden has historically signed executive orders in November during his presidency. For example, on November 15, 2021, he signed Executive Order 14052, which pertains to the implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act[4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is November historically a month with few executive orders by U.S. presidents?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not offer specific data or analysis on the monthly distribution of executive orders issued by U.S. presidents. They discuss the overall numbers, historical context, and significant examples of executive orders, but they do not break down the data by month.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is **UNCLEAR** whether November is historically a month with few executive orders.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Federal Register experiencing delays or backlogs in publishing executive orders as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that the Federal Register is experiencing delays or backlogs in publishing executive orders as of November 2024. The sources discuss various updates, filings, and publications, but they do not mention any general delays or backlogs in the publication of executive orders.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Biden signed any executive orders in October 2024?\nANSWER: YES, President Biden has signed executive orders in October 2024. Specifically, one of the executive orders mentioned is Executive Order 14127, which was signed on September 26, but there are also mentions of other executive orders signed in 2024, including those in October. For example, the Federal Register and other sources indicate that President Biden signed several executive orders in 2024, including those after September[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any scheduled events or legislative deadlines in November 2024 that could lead to executive orders?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of scheduled events or legislative deadlines in November 2024 that could lead to executive orders. The sources primarily list various cultural, entertainment, and community events, as well as holidays and observances, but do not address potential legislative or governmental actions that might result in executive orders.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Biden's rate of signing executive orders decreased in 2024 compared to previous years?\nANSWER: To determine if President Biden's rate of signing executive orders has decreased in 2024 compared to previous years, we need to compare the number of executive orders signed in 2024 to those signed in previous years.\n\nAs of 2024, President Biden has signed a total of 25 executive orders[2].\n\nHowever, the sources provided do not give a comprehensive comparison of the number of executive orders signed in previous years. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude whether the rate has decreased or not based on the available information.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any legal or political constraints preventing President Biden from issuing executive orders in November 2024?\nANSWER: There are no inherent legal or political constraints specifically mentioned in the sources that would prevent President Biden from issuing executive orders in November 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- Executive orders are a tool available to the President to enact policies without the need for congressional approval, and there is no indication that this authority would be revoked or limited in November 2024[3].\n- The sources discuss various executive orders issued by President Biden in 2024, indicating that he has been actively using this executive power[3][5].\n- While there can be legal challenges, congressional pushback, or public backlash against specific executive orders, these do not prevent the President from issuing them in the first place[3].\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any U.S. president gone an entire November without issuing an executive order in recent history?\nANSWER: To determine if any U.S. president has gone an entire November without issuing an executive order in recent history, we need to examine the historical data on executive orders.\n\nWhile the sources provided do not offer a detailed month-by-month breakdown of executive orders issued by each president, they do provide some insights into the frequency and volume of executive orders.\n\n- The sources [4] and [5] list the total number of executive orders issued by each president and sometimes break them down by year, but they do not specify the exact dates or months when these orders were issued.\n\nGiven the lack of specific monthly data, it is not possible to definitively say whether any U.S. president has gone an entire November without issuing an executive order based on the provided sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is President Biden still in office as President of the United States in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is unclear whether President Biden is still in office as President of the United States in November 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The source from Wikipedia mentions that Joe Biden suspended his 2024 presidential campaign, but it does not provide information on whether he has been succeeded by a new president as of November 2024[2].\n- The YouTube video and associated description indicate that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will make a public appearance together at a Veterans Day ceremony, but it also mentions that Kamala Harris lost the presidential election to President-elect Trump. However, it does not specify the exact date of the transition or whether Biden has officially left office[3].\n- The White House statement about the presidential delegation to Botswana does not address the status of Biden's presidency as of November 2024[1].\n\nGiven this information, it is not clear whether President Biden is still in office as of November 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any ongoing policy issues or crises that might prompt President Biden to issue executive orders in November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several ongoing policy issues and crises that could prompt President Biden to issue executive orders in November 2024. Here are some key areas:\n\n## Climate Action\nPresident Biden has been actively addressing climate change, and with the increasing urgency of the issue, he might issue executive orders to declare a climate emergency, allocate additional climate funding, or implement measures like decarbonizing the maritime industry and banning offshore drilling[1].\n\n## Immigration and Border Policies\nGiven the impending threat of Trump's immigration policies, including mass deportations and the resumption of family separation at the border, Biden might issue executive orders to fast-track citizenship applications, reverse executive orders restricting asylum, and expand work permits for undocumented immigrants[1].\n\n## Criminal Justice Reform\nBiden has the opportunity to reform criminal justice by concluding the review process for marijuana's legal status and recommending its de-scheduling. He could also pardon individuals in federal prison for nonviolent drug offenses, which would advance both criminal and racial justice[1].\n\n## Artificial Intelligence Regulation\nAlthough Trump has vowed to repeal Biden's AI executive order, Biden might take further action to solidify the existing safeguards and guidance on AI use by federal agencies before the transition[2].\n\n## Authoritarianism and Judicial Appointments\nTo protect American democracy from the threat of authoritarianism, Biden could issue executive orders to fill judicial vacancies with judges who will uphold the rule of law and address election integrity concerns[1].\n\nThese areas highlight the pressing issues that President Biden might address through executive orders in his final weeks in office.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately 18 days left in November 2024. The outcome will be known shortly after the end of the month when the Federal Register updates its listings for November.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf no additional executive orders are issued by President Joe Biden in November 2024, and assuming none have been issued so far this month, the Federal Register would list exactly zero executive orders for November 2024. The question would then resolve as **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith about 4 to 5 days left in the month, the likelihood of no executive orders being issued increases slightly due to the limited time frame. In that case, I would adjust the probability of the question resolving as **Yes** to **20%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately 72 days left (extending into future months), the chance of at least one executive order being issued in November 2024 would be higher due to the increased time for policy developments. Therefore, I would decrease the probability of the question resolving as **Yes** to **10%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Patterns:** President Biden has historically signed executive orders in November during his presidency. On average, he issues about 2 executive orders per month.\n\n- **Current Context:** As of November 12, 2024, there is no specific information indicating that President Biden has signed any executive orders this month. However, given his active use of executive orders and ongoing policy issues, it is likely that he may issue at least one before the month ends.\n\n- **Policy Factors:** There are pressing issues such as climate action, immigration, criminal justice reform, and AI regulation that might prompt executive action in November 2024.\n\n- **Political Considerations:** Even if President Biden is approaching the end of his term, presidents often use the remaining time to solidify their policy legacies through executive orders, especially during the lame-duck period.\n\n- **Uncertainties:** While there's a chance that no executive orders will be issued due to unforeseen circumstances or strategic decisions, the probability remains low based on historical and contextual factors.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
