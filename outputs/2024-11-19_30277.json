    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS exceed 2.6M for November 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which can be access through [this link](https://www.fbi.gov/file-repository/nics_firearm_checks_-_month_year.pdf/view), shows greater than 2,600,000 background check initiated in November 2024. If the number is less than or equal to 2,600,000, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNumbers are expected to be reported in the month subsequent, so for example October numbers are expected to be reported in November. In case of reporting delays, resolution will wait, until the question will be annulled in early January 2025 if there are no numbers reported by then for the time in question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn the long term (since the turn of the 21st Century), firearms sales in the US have risen, surging in 2020, with numbers trending downward since. Starting in July 2024, year-over-year monthly numbers have again begun trending upward.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) will exceed 2.6 million for November 2024, here are some relevant points and trends:\n\n## Historical Context and Trends\n- The year 2023 saw nearly 29.9 million background checks, which is a decrease from the previous year but still a significant number[3].\n- 2023 was the fourth highest year on record for firearm sales since the NICS system was implemented, following closely behind the record years of 2020, 2021, and 2022[4].\n- There has been a consistent trend of over 1 million monthly NICS background checks associated with firearm sales since July 2019[5].\n\n## Recent Monthly Data\n- In August 2024, the NSSF-adjusted NICS figure was 1,210,995, which represents an 8.3% increase year-over-year. The unadjusted August 2024 FBI NICS figure was 2,163,540, a 5.7% increase from August 2023[5].\n\n## Election Year Impact\n- Historically, presidential election years have seen higher firearm sales and background checks. For example, in every presidential election year since 2000, yearly NSSF-adjusted firearm sales totals have been higher than the previous year[4].\n\n## Current Market Conditions\n- The ongoing political climate, particularly with the 2024 presidential election and the stance of candidates on gun control, is likely to influence gun sales. There is an expectation that gun sales could increase as buyers anticipate potential changes in gun laws[1][4].\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The average monthly background checks in 2024 have been around 2 million or more, based on the August 2024 data. Given the historical trend of increased sales during election years, it is plausible that November could see a similar or higher number of background checks[5].\n\nGiven these points, while it is not possible to predict with absolute certainty, the historical trends and current market conditions suggest that the number of FBI firearms background checks for November 2024 could indeed be high. The recent monthly data and the impact of election years on gun sales support the possibility that the number could exceed 2.6 million. However, this is not a definitive prediction but rather an informed assessment based on available data and trends.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the FBI NICS system report more than 2,600,000 background checks in October 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe FBI NICS system reported 2,298,383 background checks for October 2024, which is less than 2,600,000[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major firearm retailers reporting increased sales in November 2024 compared to the same month last year?\nANSWER: No, major firearm retailers are not reporting increased sales in November 2024 compared to the same month last year. According to the sources, while there was a slight increase in gun sales in some months following Kamala Harris's nomination, the trend did not continue into October and likely not into November.\n\nSpecifically, the October 2024 data shows a 5% decline in FBI background checks compared to the same month in 2023, indicating that gun sales did not increase[3].\n\nThere is no specific data provided for November 2024 in the sources, but the trend from October suggests that sales were not increasing.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there any significant reporting delays for NICS background check data in November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nIn November 2024, there were significant reporting delays for NICS background check data in Washington state due to a cyberattack on the state's Judicial Information Systems. This outage, which occurred on November 2, forced the firearm background check system, known as the Secure Automated Firearms E-Check (SAFE) system, offline, causing a two-week delay in processing background checks[3][4][5].\n\nThe system was restored on November 17, and efforts were underway to clear the backlog of background check requests, but it was anticipated to take at least another week to fully catch up[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the 2024 presidential election influencing consumer behavior towards gun purchases?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the 2024 presidential election does not appear to be significantly influencing consumer behavior towards gun purchases.\n\n- A report from the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) indicates that October 2024 saw a five percent decline in FBI background checks related to gun sales compared to the same time the previous year. This suggests that, despite the election and the stark contrast in gun policies between the candidates, there has not been an increase in gun purchases[4].\n\n- The decline in gun sales and background checks is attributed more to a continuing downturn following the unprecedented sales levels during 2020, rather than any immediate concern about the election outcome or potential new restrictions[4].\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that the 2024 presidential election is not currently driving an increase in gun purchases.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the number of monthly NICS background checks shown an upward trend since July 2024?\nANSWER: The number of monthly NICS background checks has shown a mixed trend since July 2024, but not a consistent upward trend.\n\n- In July 2024, the NSSF-adjusted NICS figure increased by 4.0 percent year-over-year to 1,064,790[3].\n- In August 2024, the NSSF-adjusted NICS figure increased by 8.3 percent year-over-year to 1,210,995, showing an increase from July[1].\n- However, in September 2024, the NSSF-adjusted NICS figure was 1,156,223, which is a 1.3 percent increase over the same month in 2023 but a decrease from the August 2024 figure[2].\n\nTherefore, while there were increases in some months, the trend is not consistently upward since July 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are firearm manufacturers experiencing higher production rates in late 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether firearm manufacturers are experiencing higher production rates in late 2024.\n\n- The sources provide data and trends up to 2023, but do not offer specific information about production rates in late 2024. For example, the 2024 Industry Outlook discusses expectations and trends but does not provide real-time data for late 2024[4].\n- The U.S. Firearms Industry Today Report 2024 and other sources discuss the industry's performance in 2021 and 2022, and the outlook based on past trends, but they do not include current production data for 2024[1][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have historical monthly NICS background check numbers in November exceeded 2.6 million in previous election years?\nANSWER: To determine if historical monthly NICS background check numbers in November have exceeded 2.6 million in previous election years, we need to look at the specific data for November from the sources provided.\n\n- In the source from NRA Women, it mentions that the unadjusted November 2023 FBI NICS figure was 2,594,906, which is below 2.6 million[2].\n- The source from The Truth About Guns discusses the November 2021 NSSF-adjusted NICS total, but also provides the unadjusted FBI NICS figure for November 2021, which was 2,692,188. This figure is slightly above 2.6 million[3].\n- The NSSF source for 2023 also provides unadjusted FBI NICS figures, but the total for the week leading up to and including Black Friday in November 2023 was 680,671, and the total for the entire month is not explicitly stated as exceeding 2.6 million[4].\n\nGiven the data, the unadjusted FBI NICS figure for November 2021 was 2,692,188, which exceeds 2.6 million. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current political climate in the US contributing to increased gun purchases in November 2024?\nANSWER: The current political climate in the US is likely contributing to increased gun purchases in the lead-up to November 2024, although the specific impact in November itself is not directly stated. Here are some points that support this inference:\n\n1. **Election Cycle and Gun Sales**: Historical data shows that gun sales often increase during election cycles, particularly when there are fears of potential changes to gun control laws. The 2020 presidential election and the COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in gun purchases, and similar trends are anticipated for the 2024 election[5].\n\n2. **Legislative Actions and Public Sentiment**: The ongoing debates and legislative actions on gun control, such as the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and proposals for stricter gun laws by candidates like Kamala Harris, can fuel concerns among gun owners and potential buyers. This can lead to an increase in gun purchases as buyers anticipate stricter laws if certain candidates win[5].\n\n3. **Candidate Stances**: The divergent stances of presidential candidates on gun control, with some advocating for stricter laws and others opposing new restrictions, contribute to the uncertainty and anxiety that can drive gun sales[3][4].\n\nGiven these factors, it is reasonable to conclude that the current political climate is contributing to increased gun purchases in the period leading up to the November 2024 election.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major events or social factors in November 2024 that could drive up firearm sales?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several events and social factors in November 2024 that could potentially drive up firearm sales, although the direct impact on firearm sales is not explicitly stated. Here are some relevant points:\n\n## Political and Social Tensions\n- The ongoing political tensions and the recent presidential election in the United States, with Donald Trump and Kamala Harris as the main candidates, could contribute to increased anxiety and a desire for self-defense among some segments of the population[4].\n\n## Border Crisis and Security Concerns\n- The ongoing Mexico–United States border crisis, including the Texas National Guard's actions and the broader national debate on border security, could heighten concerns about personal safety and security, potentially leading to increased firearm sales[4].\n\n## Protests and Civil Unrest\n- Protests on college campuses against Israel and other social and political issues could contribute to a general sense of instability, which might drive some individuals to purchase firearms for self-defense[4].\n\n## International Conflicts\n- The ongoing Israel–Hamas war and other international conflicts could also contribute to a climate of fear and uncertainty, which might influence some people to buy firearms[1].\n\n## Economic and Social Uncertainty\n- Economic concerns, such as the potential for inflation and higher interest rates due to proposed tariffs, could also play a role in increasing firearm sales as people prepare for potential economic instability[1].\n\nWhile these factors do not directly state an increase in firearm sales, they create a context of heightened tension, security concerns, and social unrest that historically can drive up demand for firearms. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**, but there are several factors that could potentially contribute to increased firearm sales.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any recent legislation proposed that could impact firearm sales in November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent legislative developments and proposals that could impact firearm sales as of November 2024.\n\n1. **Federal Level**: The \"Assault Weapons Ban of 2023\" (H.R. 698) was introduced in the 118th Congress. This bill aims to ban the import, sale, manufacture, transfer, or possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices, with certain exemptions. Although it has not yet been enacted, it is a current proposal that could significantly impact firearm sales if passed[1].\n\n2. **State Level - Michigan**: Michigan has recently implemented several new gun laws, including universal background checks for all firearm purchases, safe storage laws, and extreme risk protection orders (ERPOs). These laws, which took effect in February 2024, require purchasing licenses and background checks for all firearm sales, including those from private sellers[2][4][5].\n\n3. **Other States**: Other states are also considering or have recently passed gun safety legislation. For example, Delaware has enacted a law requiring a purchaser permit for handgun purchases, and California has mandated the use of specific merchant category codes for firearm and ammunition purchases to detect suspicious activity. Similar bills are pending in other states like Colorado and New York[5].\n\nThese legislative actions and proposals indicate ongoing efforts to regulate firearm sales and possession, which could have an impact in November 2024 if enacted or fully implemented.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n\nAs of **November 19, 2024**, the resolution of whether the number of FBI firearms background checks initiated through the NICS will exceed 2.6 million for **November 2024** is pending. Given the possibility of reporting delays due to the recent cyberattack in Washington state and the criteria stating that resolution will wait until early January 2025 if numbers are not reported by then, there is approximately **1.5 months** left until the outcome is known.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n\nIf current trends **continued unchanged**, the number of NICS background checks for November 2024 would likely follow the pattern observed in **October 2024**, which reported **2,298,383** background checks—**below** the 2.6 million threshold. Without any significant shifts in market conditions, political climate, or unforeseen events, it is reasonable to expect that **November's figures would remain below 2.6 million**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n\nWith only **a quarter of the remaining time** (~11 days) until the outcome is determined, the forecast would remain aligned with the current trajectory. Given the **persistent downward trend** from previous months and the absence of indicators suggesting a sudden surge in firearm purchases, the expectation would continue to be that **NICS background checks will not exceed 2.6 million** in November 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n\nIf there were **four times the time left** (~6 months) until the outcome is known, the forecast would still **lean towards NICS background checks not exceeding 2.6 million**. Extending the timeline does not inherently suggest an increase in firearm sales, especially considering the **current downward trends**, **reporting delays**, and **lack of significant legislative changes** that would drive a substantial rise in background checks within that extended period.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAnalyzing the provided data and subquestions reveals several key factors:\n\n1. **Historical Trends:** October 2024 recorded **2,298,383** background checks, significantly below the 2.6 million threshold. While there has been a general long-term rise in firearm sales since July 2024, recent months show either stabilization or slight declines.\n\n2. **Reporting Delays:** The cyberattack on Washington state's Judicial Information Systems introduced delays in November's data. While efforts are underway to clear the backlog, there's no substantial evidence to suggest that these delays have artificially inflated the background check numbers.\n\n3. **Market Conditions:** Major firearm retailers are **not reporting increased sales** in November 2024 compared to the previous year. The political climate, despite being an election year, does not currently appear to be driving a surge in gun purchases.\n\n4. **Legislative Impact:** Recent and proposed firearm regulations may have a **chilling effect** on firearm sales, further reducing the likelihood of exceeding the 2.6 million background checks threshold.\n\n5. **Subquestion Insights:** Most subquestions indicate either a **negation** or **unclear impact** regarding factors that could push the number of background checks above 2.6 million. Only a few subquestions hint at potential drivers for increased sales, but these are either **unclear** or **not sufficiently strong** to override the prevailing trends.\n\nTaking all these factors into account, the probability that NICS background checks for November 2024 will exceed 2.6 million remains **low**.\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
