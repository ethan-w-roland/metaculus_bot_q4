{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Nippon Steel acquire US Steel before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Nippon Steel or US Steel issue a press release or any other posts saying that Nippon Steel has acquired US Steel, at the following respective news link pages: [Nippon Steel news](https://www.nipponsteel.com/en/news/) and [US Steel news](https://investors.ussteel.com/news-events/news-releases) when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after January 1, 2025. As a secondary resolution source, Metaculus Admins will use US Steel's SEC filings at [this](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=0001163302&owner=exclude) EDGAR link. \n\nIf no such press release is found at either news page, and there is no posted SEC filing at the link from US Steel indicating the acquisition has occurred, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nFor purposes of this question, in order to facilitate streamlined resolution no other resolution source will be considered, so forecasters are urged to predict accordingly. If either news release site is down, resolution will wait for up to 7 days. If SEC's Edgar site is down, resolution will wait for up to 7 days. If the resolution source links remains inaccessible after that time for any reason (including the companies discontinuing their news sections or changing the URL and not auto-forwarding to the new page), and the secondary resolution source link remains inaccessible after that time for any reason (including the SEC discontinuing its \"Classic version\"), this question resolves as No. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to a press release dated September 19, 2024, US Steel's president and CEO said, \"We continue to progress through the U.S. regulatory reviews of the pending transaction with Nippon Steel, and are confident in our ability to achieve these approvals. We continue to work towards closing the transaction by the end of the year.\" However, the aquisition has recently been [held up](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/us/politics/us-steel-nippon-steel-deal.html) due to national security reviews from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which may delay closing of the transaction into 2025 or even cause the transaction to be cancelled.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Nippon Steel Corporation will acquire US Steel before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Announcement and Initial Timeline\n- Nippon Steel and US Steel announced the acquisition on December 18, 2023, with an initial expectation that the deal would close in the second or third quarter of 2024.\n\n## Regulatory Approvals and Delays\n- The acquisition is subject to various regulatory approvals, including a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and the Department of Justice. These reviews have introduced significant delays. Nippon Steel received a \"second request\" from the US Department of Justice for additional documentation, which has pushed the expected closing date to sometime between July and December 2024.\n- The national security review by CFIUS could take longer than initially expected, potentially extending into 2025.\n\n## Shareholder Approval\n- US Steel shareholders have already approved the acquisition, with over 98% of the shares voted in favor of the transaction on April 12, 2024.\n\n## Political and Labor Considerations\n- The deal faces opposition from the United Steelworkers (USW) union and from presidential candidates, including President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. This political opposition could further complicate and delay the approval process.\n\n## Current Status\n- As of the latest updates, Nippon Steel has extended the scheduled timing of the acquisition completion until the end of 2024, but there is a possibility that the deal might not be finalized before the US presidential election in November 2024 or even before January 1, 2025.\n\nGiven these points, while the deal is still expected to close in 2024 according to the latest adjustments, the various regulatory and political hurdles make it uncertain whether it will be finalized before January 1, 2025. Therefore, the answer to whether Nippon Steel will acquire US Steel before January 1, 2025, is not immediately clear and depends on the resolution of ongoing regulatory and political issues.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nippon Steel issued a press release confirming the acquisition of US Steel before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: No, Nippon Steel has not issued a press release confirming the acquisition of U.S. Steel before January 1, 2025. The sources indicate that the acquisition is still in the process of regulatory review and has not yet been completed. The expected closing date has been delayed to the end of 2024 or possibly into 2025 due to regulatory scrutiny and other hurdles.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the United Steelworkers (USW) union withdrawn its opposition to the acquisition before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources clearly indicate that the United Steelworkers (USW) union has not withdrawn its opposition to the acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel. Despite an arbitration board ruling allowing the transaction to proceed, the USW has continued to express strong opposition and has vowed to fight the deal.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review of the acquisition without requesting additional documentation before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not specify whether the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has completed its review of a specific acquisition without requesting additional documentation before January 1, 2025. They discuss general changes to the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) rules and the merger review process, but do not provide details on the status of specific acquisitions or the DOJ's actions in individual cases.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have US Steel shareholders maintained their approval of the acquisition beyond April 12, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the approval of the acquisition by U.S. Steel shareholders has been revoked or changed after April 12, 2024. The sources consistently report that the shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger on April 12, 2024, and there is no mention of any subsequent reversal or change in this approval.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) approved the acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nAs of the latest information available, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has not approved the acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel. In fact, the Biden Administration has been preparing to block the acquisition, and the review process is expected to extend into late 2024 or even 2025. There is no indication that CFIUS has given its approval before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has US Steel issued a press release confirming the acquisition by Nippon Steel before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, while there have been several announcements and discussions about the proposed acquisition, there is no confirmation that the acquisition has been finalized or that U.S. Steel has issued a press release confirming the completion of the acquisition before January 1, 2025.\n\nThe sources indicate that the deal is still undergoing regulatory reviews and faces opposition, which has delayed the closing of the deal until possibly late 2024 or 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has US Steel filed the necessary acquisition documentation with the SEC indicating the completion of the acquisition before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel Corporation has been announced and the necessary documentation has been filed with the SEC, but the completion of the acquisition has not yet occurred as of the latest information available.\n\nThe sources indicate that the transaction is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\n\nSince the acquisition has not been completed and the necessary final documentation for completion has not been filed as of the date of the sources, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the acquisition closing date been officially set to occur before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not mention anything about an acquisition closing date or any specific transaction related to an acquisition. They focus primarily on the requirements and deadlines for the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) and the filing of Beneficial Ownership Information Reports (BOIR) with FinCEN. Therefore, there is no information available to determine if an acquisition closing date has been officially set to occur before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have all necessary regulatory approvals for the acquisition been obtained by Nippon Steel and US Steel before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: No, all necessary regulatory approvals for the acquisition have not been obtained by Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel before January 1, 2025.\n\nAs of the latest information, while Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have received all regulatory approvals outside of the United States, they are still awaiting approval from U.S. regulators, including the Department of Justice and possibly the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CIFUS).\n\nThe deal is subject to the fulfillment of remaining U.S. regulatory approvals, and there are indications that the process may extend into late 2024 or even 2025 due to ongoing regulatory scrutiny and potential national security concerns.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any changes in the U.S. presidential administration that affect the approval of the acquisition before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are discussions and proposals related to changes in administrative policies and regulations, but they do not specifically address changes in the approval process for acquisitions that would be effective before January 1, 2025, in the context of the U.S. presidential administration.\n\nHowever, one relevant point is the mention of proposed changes to the Buy American Act regulations and other administrative actions, but these are part of ongoing rulemaking processes and do not necessarily indicate a change in the approval process for acquisitions that would be implemented before January 1, 2025.\n\nAdditionally, the sources discuss broader policy proposals and changes in tax regulations, but these do not directly address the approval process for acquisitions.\n\nGiven the information provided, there is no clear indication of specific changes to the approval process for acquisitions that would be effective before January 1, 2025.\n\n**UNCLEAR**", "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**  \nToday is October 21, 2024, and the resolution date is January 1, 2025.  \n**Time left:** Approximately 72 days.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**  \nIf the current situation remains unchanged, with ongoing regulatory reviews and persistent political opposition, the acquisition is unlikely to be completed by January 1, 2025. Regulatory hurdles, especially from CFIUS, are significant and typically involve lengthy processes that are already causing delays.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**  \nWith only about 18 days left, the likelihood of the acquisition being finalized in such a short timeframe is exceedingly low. Most regulatory approvals, especially those involving national security considerations, cannot be expedited to this extent.  \n**Forecast with a quarter of the time left:** 5%\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**  \nIf there were approximately 10 months left instead of 2.5 months, there would be more time to navigate the regulatory landscape, address political opposition, and fulfill any remaining conditions. This extended timeframe would increase the probability of the acquisition being completed successfully.  \n**Forecast with 4x the time left:** 40%\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe acquisition of US Steel by Nippon Steel faces significant regulatory and political challenges that have already caused notable delays. The involvement of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) adds layers of complexity, especially given national security concerns. Additionally, strong opposition from the United Steelworkers (USW) union and political figures further hampers progress. While shareholder approval is a positive indicator, the absence of recent press releases confirming the acquisition suggests that the deal is not in its final stages. Given the current timeline and the depth of existing obstacles, the probability of the acquisition being completed by January 1, 2025, remains low.\n\n**Probability: 15%**", "probability": 15}
