    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the cheapest new Tesla Model 3 be listed as under $43,000 on December 30, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-12\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, on December 30, 2024, the cheapest Tesla Model 3 for US buyers is offered at the Tesla website for under $43,000. If the price is greater than or equal to $43,000, this question resolves as **No**. On of after December 30, 2024, Metaculus Admins will access the Model 3 design page, currently at [this link](https://www.tesla.com/model3/design#overview). They will click on the \"Cash\" price and uncheck the box to include estimated incentives of $7,500 and 5-year gas savings.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source other than Tesla's official website will be considered. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of November 11, 2024, this price was $42,490\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the cheapest new Tesla Model 3 will be listed as under $43,000 on December 30, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Pricing\nAs of the current data, the base model of the 2024 Tesla Model 3, which is the Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) version, starts at an MSRP of around $38,990 to $40,630, depending on the source[2][4][5].\n\n## Price Stability\nTesla is known for adjusting prices periodically, and these changes can occur without much notice. However, there is no indication in the current data that the base price of the Model 3 will drop below its current level or increase significantly above $43,000 for the base model by December 30, 2024.\n\n## Trim Levels and Options\nThe prices mentioned above are for the base model without any additional upgrades or options. Any upgrades or additional features would increase the price, but the base model itself is currently priced below $43,000[2][4][5].\n\nGiven this information, it is likely that the cheapest new Tesla Model 3 will still be listed as under $43,000 on December 30, 2024, assuming no significant price adjustments by Tesla.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- **Base Rate**: The current base price of the Model 3 is below $43,000.\n- **Reference Class**: Historical data shows that Tesla's pricing can fluctuate, but the base model has generally remained in a similar price range.\n\n### Time to Resolution\nSince the query is about a specific date (December 30, 2024), any changes in pricing would need to be monitored closely up until that date. However, based on current information, it appears likely that the base model will remain under $43,000.\n\nIn summary, based on the current data, the answer to whether the cheapest new Tesla Model 3 will be listed as under $43,000 on December 30, 2024, is likely \"yes,\" but this is subject to any potential price adjustments by Tesla.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Tesla recently reduced the prices of its vehicles in response to decreasing demand?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nTesla has recently reduced the prices of its vehicles in response to decreasing demand and increasing competition. In April 2024, Tesla cut prices by $2,000 on three of its models in the U.S., and also reduced prices in China and Germany[1].\n\nAdditionally, in May 2024, Tesla further dropped prices by $3-$5,000 on the Model Y and Model 3[2]. These price reductions are part of Tesla's strategy to boost sales and maintain market dominance amidst slowing demand and competitive pressure.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Tesla historically made significant price changes to the Model 3 during the months of November and December in past years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of significant price changes to the Tesla Model 3 exclusively during the months of November and December in past years.\n\n- The sources discuss various price changes and adjustments made by Tesla, but these are generally noted for other months such as January, April, March, and October[5].\n- There is no mention of November or December as months when significant price changes were made to the Model 3.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is inflation in the U.S. significantly higher than in previous years as of November 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 2024, the inflation rate in the U.S. is not significantly higher than in previous years when compared to recent trends.\n\n- The annual inflation rate in the U.S. stood at 2.4% for the 12 months ending September 2024, which is the lowest since February 2021[2][3][4].\n- This rate has been decreasing over the past few months, indicating a downward trend from the higher rates seen in 2022 and early 2023[2][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the current inflation rate is actually lower than the rates observed in the preceding years.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Tesla announced any plans to increase the price of the Model 3 between now and December 30, 2024?\nANSWER: YES, Tesla has announced plans to increase the price of the Model 3 in certain contexts between now and December 30, 2024.\n\n- In Europe, Tesla anticipates a need to raise the prices of Model 3 vehicles starting from July 1, 2024, due to the European Union's decision to impose higher tariffs on electric cars imported from China[5].\n- Additionally, there have been recent price increases for the 2024 Tesla Model 3 in the U.S., such as the $1,500 price hike for the Model 3 Long Range and the gradual price increases for the Model 3 Performance since its launch in April 2024[2][3]. While these increases have already occurred, they indicate a trend of potential further adjustments.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant supply chain disruptions affecting Tesla's production as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the information is primarily about events and disruptions that occurred earlier in 2024, but it does not provide real-time or current data as of November 2024.\n\n- The sources mention significant supply chain disruptions in the first quarter of 2024, such as the suspension of production at Tesla's Berlin gigafactory due to Red Sea shipping disruptions and an alleged arson attack on its German factory[1][3][4].\n- However, there is no specific information in these sources about ongoing or current supply chain disruptions as of November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether there are significant supply chain disruptions affecting Tesla's production as of November 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the base price of the Tesla Model 3 increased by more than $500 at any point during the past 12 months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of a price increase of more than $500 for the base model of the Tesla Model 3 in the past 12 months.\n\n- The sources mention various price increases for different models and configurations, but they do not specify any recent increases for the base Model 3 that exceed $500[1][4][5].\n- In January 2023, Tesla actually implemented price cuts, including for the Model 3, which would not contribute to an increase[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any credible reports suggesting a new Model 3 refresh or update to be released before December 30, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are credible reports suggesting a new Model 3 refresh or update will be released before December 30, 2024.\n\n- Reports indicate that the 2024 Tesla Model 3 refresh, part of project ‘Highland,’ is expected to debut this month, with production already underway or set to start by the end of September 2023. Deliveries in China and Europe are anticipated to begin shortly thereafter, and U.S. deliveries are likely to follow in early 2024[2][3].\n- The refresh includes updates such as a sleeker exterior design, a quieter and more luxurious cabin, new tech features, and longer range batteries[2][3].\n\nThese sources confirm that the updated Model 3 will be available well before December 30, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current price of the base Tesla Model 3 for U.S. buyers under $42,500 as of November 12, 2024?\nANSWER: No, the current price of the base Tesla Model 3 for U.S. buyers is not under $42,500 as of November 12, 2024. According to the latest information, the base price of the 2024 Tesla Model 3 with rear-wheel drive starts at $40,380, but this does not include the $1,390 destination charge. When including the destination charge, the total price would be $41,770, which is still under $42,500. However, considering the context of the question, it is clear that the base price plus the destination charge is what is relevant.\n\nSo, the total base price including the destination charge is $41,770, which is indeed under $42,500[2]. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming Tesla events or announcements scheduled before December 30, 2024, that might affect pricing?\nANSWER: Yes, there are upcoming Tesla events and announcements that could potentially affect pricing before December 30, 2024.\n\n1. **Tesla's 10/10 Event**: Scheduled for October 10, 2024, this event is expected to be significant, with potential announcements about new vehicles, including the robotaxi (Cyber cab), and possibly the humanoid robot Optimus. Such announcements could influence pricing strategies for both new and existing models[1][5].\n\n2. **Q3 2024 Earnings Call and Sales Release**: On October 23, 2024, Tesla will release its Q3 2024 earnings and sales data. This financial information can impact the company's stock price and potentially influence vehicle pricing[2].\n\nThese events could provide insights into Tesla's future product lineup, technological advancements, and financial health, all of which could have implications for vehicle pricing.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the U.S. government announced any changes in electric vehicle incentives or taxes that would impact the price of the Tesla Model 3 before December 30, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about any new announcements or changes by the U.S. government regarding electric vehicle incentives or taxes that would impact the price of the Tesla Model 3 before December 30, 2024.\n\nHowever, the sources do mention existing incentives, such as the $7,500 federal tax credit, which is still applicable to certain Tesla models, including the Model Y after the IRS updated its classification[4].\n\nSince there is no mention of new changes or announcements, the answer to whether the U.S. government has announced any changes in electric vehicle incentives or taxes that would impact the price of the Tesla Model 3 before December 30, 2024, is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are 48 days remaining until December 30, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, the cheapest new Tesla Model 3 would be listed at **$42,490**, which is under $43,000. Therefore, the question would resolve as **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only 12 days left until December 30, 2024, I would forecast a higher probability—around **90%**—that the price would remain under $43,000, since there would be less time for any significant price changes to occur.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were 192 days left (approximately 6 months), I would forecast a lower probability—around **70%**—as there would be more opportunity for Tesla to adjust prices due to market conditions, new model releases, or other factors.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSeveral factors influence the probability that the cheapest new Tesla Model 3 will be listed under $43,000 on December 30, 2024:\n\n1. **Current Pricing:**\n   - As of November 11, 2024, the base price is **$42,490**, which is $510 below the $43,000 threshold.\n\n2. **Price Stability and Trends:**\n   - **Tesla's Pricing Behavior:** Tesla is known for adjusting prices, sometimes multiple times within a year.\n   - **Recent Price Changes:** In 2024, Tesla has both reduced and increased prices in response to demand and competitive pressures.\n   - **Historical Data:** There is no clear pattern of significant price increases specifically during November and December.\n\n3. **Market Factors:**\n   - **Demand and Competition:** Tesla has recently reduced prices to stimulate demand amidst increasing competition.\n   - **Inflation:** The U.S. inflation rate is currently low (2.4%), reducing cost pressures that might force Tesla to increase prices.\n   - **Supply Chain:** There is no clear evidence of significant supply chain disruptions affecting Tesla as of November 2024.\n\n4. **Upcoming Events and Announcements:**\n   - **Tesla Events:** Upcoming events like the \"10/10 Event\" could introduce new models or technology, potentially impacting pricing strategies.\n   - **Model 3 Refresh:** The refreshed Model 3 has been released; however, it is already reflected in the current pricing.\n   - **Regulatory Changes:** No imminent changes in U.S. government incentives or taxes are expected before December 30, 2024.\n\n5. **Potential Price Increases:**\n   - **Announcements:** Tesla has indicated plans to raise prices in certain markets due to tariffs (e.g., EU tariffs on Chinese imports), but there's no clear indication of significant price increases in the U.S. market within the next 48 days.\n   - **Small Adjustments:** While Tesla may adjust prices slightly, a price increase of over $510 (the difference between the current price and $43,000) in the next 48 days is possible but less likely.\n\n6. **Time Frame Consideration:**\n   - **Short Time Frame:** With only 48 days remaining, substantial changes in base pricing are less probable.\n   - **Quarter of Time Left (12 days):** Even less likely for significant changes.\n   - **Four Times the Time Left (192 days):** In a longer time frame, there's more uncertainty and higher risk of price adjustments.\n\n7. **External Economic Factors:**\n   - **Currency Fluctuations:** Unlikely to have a major impact on U.S. pricing in the short term.\n   - **Economic Stability:** Current economic indicators do not suggest imminent shocks that would drastically affect Tesla's pricing.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the above factors, especially the short time frame and the lack of clear indicators for a significant price increase, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability that the price will remain under $43,000 on December 30, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
