    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore January 1, 2025, will the International Criminal Court issue an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-15\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if before January 1, 2025, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issues a warrant of arrest for Benjamin Netanyahu (Prime Minister). \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nA summons to voluntarily appear will not count, only an arrest warrant will resolve as Yes.\nSecret warrants will only resolve as Yes if they are publicly and officially disclosed by a credible source before Jan 1, 2025. Anonymous or unsourced reporting that such a warrant has been issued will not be sufficient. If a secret arrest warrant is issued before Jan 1, 2025, but not publicly known until after that, it will not count.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn April 29, 2024, Axios [reported](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/29/netanyahu-biden-icc-arrest-warrants-war-crimes) that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked US President Joe Biden to help prevent the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague from issuing arrest warrants for Israeli cabinet officials stemming from possible allegations of war crimes in Gaza. NBC [reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-fears-icc-issue-arrest-warrants-netanyahu-gaza-war-hamas-rcna149739) that these arrest warrants could come as early as this week, and Israel is working through back channels to try to prevent them from being issued. The US and other G7 countries are [reportedly](https://www.timesofisrael.com/report-several-nations-urging-icc-not-to-issue-arrest-warrants-for-israelis/) campaigning to dissuade the ICC from issuing the warrants so as to avoid jeopardizing a peace deal between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAs the ICC [explains](https://www.icc-cpi.int/about/how-the-court-works) on its official website, an arrest warrant is requested by the Prosecutor as part of the investigative stage before trial, especially in cases in which suspects do not appear voluntarily.\n\nThe ICC [was founded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court) in 2002 following the wars in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, and it is [intended](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/29/icc-israel-warrants-gaza/) as a permanent court to investigate war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity done by individuals. It issued its first arrest warrants in 2005, and according to the AP [has issued](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-international-criminal-court-hague-palestinians-1f683a6e2e150d91c415eb1d0a19a44d) a total of 42 arrest warrants. Last year the ICC issued arrest warrants for [Vladimir Putin](https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and) and one of his government officials stemming from the ICC's investigation into the deportation of Ukrainian children to Russia.\n\nSee Also\n\nBase rate information at Wikipedia: [International Criminal Court investigations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court_investigations)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the International Criminal Court (ICC) issuing an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Application for Arrest Warrants\nOn May 20, 2024, ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan filed applications for arrest warrants against several individuals, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the Gaza Strip since at least October 8, 2023[2][3][5].\n\n## Judicial Process\nThe ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber must review and approve these applications. Historically, the Pre-Trial Chamber has almost always accepted the prosecutor’s requests for arrest warrants, although this process can take several months[2][4].\n\n## Current Status\nAs of the latest updates, the applications are still under review by the ICC judges. It has been approximately five months since the prosecutor filed the requests, and there has been no official announcement of the issuance of the warrants yet[4].\n\n## Reactions and Potential Delays\nIsrael and its allies, including the United States, have strongly opposed the ICC's actions and challenged the court's jurisdiction. This opposition could potentially influence the timing or outcome, although it is unlikely to change the ICC's decision significantly[2][4][5].\n\n## Enforcement and Cooperation\nEven if the warrants are issued, their enforcement depends on the cooperation of ICC member states. However, the issuance of warrants itself carries significant legal and political weight, regardless of immediate enforcement[4].\n\nGiven these points, while it is highly likely that the ICC will issue arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant based on historical trends, the exact timing before January 1, 2025, is not certain. The process is ongoing, and the decision could be made within the next few months.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, the ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber has a high rate of approving the prosecutor’s requests for arrest warrants.\n- The ICC's process typically takes several months, but it can vary.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The applications were filed in May 2024, and it has been about five months since then.\n- The ICC's judicial process can be lengthy, but decisions are often made within a few months to a year after the application.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The ICC faces significant political opposition from Israel and its allies, but this has not typically swayed the court's decisions.\n- The court's independence and commitment to upholding international law are key factors in its decision-making process.\n\nIn summary, while the issuance of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu is likely, the exact timing before January 1, 2025, cannot be guaranteed without the ICC's official announcement. However, given the historical trends and the ongoing nature of the process, it remains a plausible outcome within the specified timeframe.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber received a formal request from the Prosecutor to issue an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe ICC Prosecutor, Karim A.A. Khan KC, has formally requested the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber to issue arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, among others. This is documented in multiple sources, including the statement from the ICC Prosecutor himself and other reports on the matter[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the ICC faced pressures or lobbying efforts from the United States or other G7 countries to refrain from issuing arrest warrants in ongoing cases?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe ICC has faced pressures and lobbying efforts from several nations, including some G7 countries, to refrain from issuing arrest warrants in the ongoing cases. For instance, the United States, which does not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction in the conflict, has been mentioned as a country that could widen the split within the Democratic party over the issue, with some Democrats potentially supporting Republican efforts to sanction ICC officials or ban them from the US[2].\n\nAdditionally, the report mentions that \"several nations\" are urging the ICC not to issue arrest warrants for Israelis, although it does not specify which G7 countries are involved beyond the general mention of Western countries[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Benjamin Netanyahu currently under investigation by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes or crimes against humanity?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, is currently under investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. The ICC Prosecutor, Karim Khan, has filed applications for arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant, alleging crimes such as starvation of civilians, attacks directed at civilians, wilful killing, and crimes against humanity including extermination and persecution, committed in the Gaza Strip from at least 8 October 2023[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the International Criminal Court previously issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state or government?\nANSWER: YES, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has previously issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state or government.\n\n- An arrest warrant was issued against Omar al-Bashir, the then-reigning President of Sudan, on 4 March 2009, and a second warrant was issued on 12 July 2010[1][4][5].\n- More recently, arrest warrants were issued against Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, and Maria Lvova-Belova, the Commissioner for Children’s Rights in the Office of the President of the Russian Federation, on 17 March 2023[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a legal precedent for the ICC issuing arrest warrants against individuals from countries that are not ICC members?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a legal precedent for the ICC issuing arrest warrants against individuals from countries that are not ICC members.\n\n- The ICC can issue arrest warrants for individuals from non-member states if the crimes were committed on the territory of an ICC member state or if the situation was referred to the ICC by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). For example, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Omar Al-Bashir, the President of Sudan, a non-member state, after the UNSC referred the situation in Darfur to the ICC[2][4][5].\n\n- Additionally, the ICC has jurisdiction over nationals of non-member countries if they commit crimes on the territory of an ICC member state[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any recent developments occurred in the ICC's investigation into the Gaza conflict that indicate an imminent decision on arrest warrants?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent developments in the ICC's investigation into the Gaza conflict that indicate steps towards a decision on arrest warrants.\n\nOn May 20, 2024, ICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan filed applications for arrest warrants against several individuals, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his defense minister Yoav Gallant, and Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri (Deif), and Ismail Haniyeh, for war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in the context of the conflict in Gaza[2][3][5].\n\nThese applications are currently being considered by a three-judge panel of Pre-Trial Chamber I, which will decide whether the necessary standard for the issuance of arrest warrants has been met[3][5]. This indicates that the process is ongoing and a decision on the arrest warrants is pending.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there substantial evidence available that supports the issuance of an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu by the ICC?\nANSWER: The question of whether there is substantial evidence available to support the issuance of an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu by the ICC is not definitively answered in the sources provided, but here are some key points:\n\n- The ICC Chief Prosecutor, Karim Khan, has filed an application for an arrest warrant against Netanyahu, alleging crimes such as the starvation of civilians, attacks directed at civilians, wilful killing, and crimes against humanity, including extermination and persecution[2][4][5].\n- Khan has stated that he has reviewed the evidence supporting the warrant requests and believes there are \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that Netanyahu and others have committed the alleged crimes[3][4].\n- A panel of experts convened by Khan has also reviewed the applications and underlying evidence, concluding that there is a basis to charge Netanyahu and Gallant for their alleged roles in a common plan to use starvation and other acts of violence against the Gazan civilian population[4].\n\nHowever, the final determination of whether the evidence is sufficient to issue an arrest warrant rests with the Pre-Trial Chamber of the ICC, which has not yet made a decision on this matter[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, while there are indications that the prosecutor believes there is substantial evidence, the ultimate decision on the sufficiency of this evidence is still pending.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been instances where the ICC issued arrest warrants despite significant political opposition from powerful countries?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been instances where the ICC issued arrest warrants despite significant political opposition from powerful countries.\n\nFor example, the ICC issued arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova for war crimes related to the deportation and transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia. This decision was made despite Russia's significant political influence and its non-membership in the ICC[5].\n\nAnother instance is the recent application for arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas leaders, which has faced strong political opposition from various quarters, including from some U.S. politicians[1][4]. These actions demonstrate the ICC's willingness to proceed with legal proceedings even in the face of substantial political opposition.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the ICC have jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed by Israeli officials despite Israel not being a party to the Rome Statute?\nANSWER: The ICC does have a basis for asserting jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed by Israeli officials, despite Israel not being a party to the Rome Statute, under certain conditions.\n\n1. **Territorial Jurisdiction**: The ICC has determined that its territorial jurisdiction extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as Palestine is a State Party to the Rome Statute[1][2][4].\n\n2. **Cross-Border Crimes**: The ICC can exercise jurisdiction if at least one element of the crime was committed on the territory of a State Party. This principle was established in the case of the Rohingya people, where the Court ruled it could exercise jurisdiction over crimes that started in Myanmar (not a State Party) but were completed in Bangladesh (a State Party). A similar approach could be applied to crimes committed by Israeli officials if any part of the crime occurred in the territory of Palestine[5].\n\n3. **Nationality Jurisdiction**: The ICC also has jurisdiction over crimes committed by nationals of States Parties, but this does not directly apply to Israeli nationals since Israel is not a State Party. However, if the crimes involve nationals of other States Parties or if other jurisdictional criteria are met, the ICC can still investigate[1][3].\n\nTherefore, the ICC can assert jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed by Israeli officials if these crimes have a connection to the territory of Palestine or if other jurisdictional criteria under the Rome Statute are satisfied.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the typical time frame for the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber to decide on arrest warrant requests accommodate a decision before January 1, 2025, in this case?\nANSWER: To determine if the typical timeframe for the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber to decide on arrest warrant requests accommodates a decision before January 1, 2025, in this case, we need to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Timing of the Request**: The ICC Prosecutor, Karim Khan, submitted the applications for arrest warrants on May 20, 2024[2][3].\n2. **Typical Timeframe**: Historically, the Pre-Trial Chamber has taken anywhere from several weeks to almost a year to make a decision on arrest warrant applications. Specifically, it has taken an average of two months in around 61 requests for arrest warrants[1].\n\nGiven that the request was made on May 20, 2024, and considering the average timeframe of two months, a decision would typically be expected by July or August 2024. However, the process can vary, and in some cases, it has taken longer.\n\n3. **Current Status and Delays**: The process has been delayed due to the filing of *amicus curiae* briefs and other submissions, which began on June 10, 2024[1].\n\nDespite these delays, the historical data suggests that a decision within the next few months is plausible. Since the request was made in May 2024, it is reasonable to expect that the Pre-Trial Chamber could make a decision before January 1, 2025.\n\nTherefore, based on the typical timeframes and the current status of the case, the answer is:\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 46 days (from November 15, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If nothing changed, the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber would continue deliberating on the Prosecutor's application for an arrest warrant against Benjamin Netanyahu, with a decision potentially issued before the deadline.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With approximately 11.5 days remaining, the probability of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant before January 1, 2025, would decrease due to limited time for the Pre-Trial Chamber to complete its review.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** With approximately 184 days remaining, the probability of the ICC issuing an arrest warrant before the extended deadline would increase, allowing more time for the judicial process to conclude.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Base Rates and Historical Precedents:**\n   - The ICC's Pre-Trial Chamber has a high approval rate for the Prosecutor's requests for arrest warrants. Historically, the Chamber has approved nearly all such requests.\n   - The average time for the Pre-Trial Chamber to decide on arrest warrant applications is approximately two months, but it can vary depending on case complexity and external factors.\n   - The ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for sitting heads of state, such as Omar al-Bashir of Sudan and Vladimir Putin of Russia, demonstrating a precedent for acting against high-ranking officials.\n\n2. **Current Status of the Case:**\n   - The Prosecutor filed applications for arrest warrants against Benjamin Netanyahu and others on May 20, 2024.\n   - It has been nearly six months since the applications were filed. While this is longer than the average decision time, it is still within a reasonable timeframe given the case's complexity and political sensitivities.\n   - There have been delays due to filings of *amicus curiae* briefs and lobbying efforts by various nations, which may have slowed the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Political Pressures and External Influences:**\n   - Israel and its allies, including the United States and some G7 countries, are reportedly lobbying against the issuance of arrest warrants to avoid jeopardizing regional stability.\n   - While political pressures exist, the ICC operates as an independent judicial body committed to upholding international law, and has proceeded with warrants in the past despite opposition.\n\n4. **Jurisdiction and Legal Considerations:**\n   - The ICC asserts jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in the Palestinian territories, as Palestine is a State Party to the Rome Statute.\n   - The Court has a legal precedent for issuing arrest warrants against individuals from non-member states if the alleged crimes occurred on the territory of a member state.\n\n5. **Time Frame Analysis:**\n   - **With 46 days remaining:** There is sufficient time for the Pre-Trial Chamber to issue a decision, especially if they are nearing the conclusion of their review.\n   - **With only 11.5 days remaining:** The probability decreases due to the limited time, making it less likely that all judicial procedures can be completed before the deadline.\n   - **With 184 days remaining:** The extended timeframe increases the likelihood of a decision being reached before the deadline, accounting for any unforeseen delays.\n\n6. **Potential Outcomes:**\n   - **Issuance of Warrant:** Given historical approval rates and the seriousness of the allegations, there is a significant chance that the warrant will be issued.\n   - **Delay or Non-Issuance:** Political lobbying and the complexity of the case might result in further delays, potentially pushing the decision past January 1, 2025.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the ICC's history of approving arrest warrant requests, the time elapsed since the application was filed, and the remaining time until the deadline, there is a substantial possibility that an arrest warrant for Benjamin Netanyahu will be issued before January 1, 2025. However, political pressures and procedural delays introduce uncertainty.\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
