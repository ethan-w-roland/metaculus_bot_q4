    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Alta ski resort be listed as Open by On the Snow's Ski Report on November 22, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-12\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if On the Snow's Alta Snow Report, currently located [here](https://www.onthesnow.com/utah/alta-ski-area/skireport), reports the ski resort's operating status as Open when accessed by Metaculus on or after November 22, 2024. If it is reported as Closed, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. In case of the resolution source being down, Metaculus Admins will wait until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nFrom the resolution source: \"The Vail snow report for Nov 01 is a 0\" base depth with 0 of 33 lifts open. Please note ski conditions and snowfall at Vail are sourced directly from the ski resort and are only recorded during the official ski season's opening to closing dates.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the Alta ski resort will be listed as open by OnTheSnow's Ski Report on November 22, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Opening Date\nAlta Ski Area is tentatively scheduled to open for the 2024-25 season on Friday, November 22, 2024, provided that the snow conditions permit it[1][4][5].\n\n## Conditions Permitting\nThe opening date is subject to snow conditions. As of the current date, Alta has already seen its first snowfall, and there is a forecast for additional snowfall on November 12, 2024[2].\n\n## Current Status\nAs of now, the lifts at Alta are closed, and no resort runs are open. However, the resort is preparing for the upcoming season, and lift tickets are set to go on sale in late October[1][2][5].\n\n## Base Rates and Historical Context\nWhile the exact snow conditions on November 22, 2024, cannot be guaranteed, Alta typically relies on natural snowfall to open its slopes. Given the anticipated snowfall and the fact that Alta has a history of opening around this time if conditions are favorable, it is plausible that the resort could open as scheduled.\n\n## Time to Resolution\nThe decision to open the resort will be made closer to the date, based on the snow conditions at that time.\n\nGiven these points, it is likely but not certain that Alta will be listed as open on November 22, 2024, by OnTheSnow's Ski Report, as it depends on the final snow conditions. Therefore, the answer cannot be clearly determined as a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" without knowing the exact snow conditions on that specific date.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Alta Ski Resort officially announced an opening date of November 22, 2024, for the 2024-2025 ski season?\nANSWER: Yes, Alta Ski Resort has officially announced an opening date of November 22, 2024, for the 2024-2025 ski season, subject to weather and snow conditions.\n\nThis information is confirmed by multiple sources:\n- The official Alta Ski Area website states that the opening day is tentatively scheduled for Friday, November 22nd—conditions permitting[1][3].\n- Other reliable sources also confirm this date[2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any local regulations or public health concerns arisen that might prevent Alta Ski Resort from opening on November 22, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any local regulations or public health concerns that might prevent Alta Ski Resort from opening on November 22, 2024. The sources consistently state that the opening date is scheduled for November 22, 2024, but note that it is \"conditions permitting,\" which typically refers to weather and snow conditions rather than regulatory or health issues[1][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is OnTheSnow.com currently operational and updating ski resort statuses as of November 12, 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe sources provided indicate that OnTheSnow.com is actively updating ski resort statuses. For example, the site is updating daily with snowfall totals, snow depths, open lifts, and terrain information for all ski resorts in Colorado and other parts of the United States[3][4][5].\n\nAdditionally, the site is providing projected opening dates, current conditions, and other relevant information as of the 2024-25 ski season, which includes updates as recent as November 2024[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have other major ski resorts in Utah scheduled their openings on or before November 22, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, several major ski resorts in Utah have scheduled their openings on or before November 22, 2024.\n\n- Brian Head Resort is set to open on November 8, 2024[1][2][3].\n- Solitude Ski Resort is scheduled to open on November 15, 2024[1][4].\n- Park City Mountain and Alta Ski Area are both set to open on November 22, 2024[1][2][3].\n\nThese dates indicate that multiple major ski resorts in Utah will open on or before November 22, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OnTheSnow.com historically provided accurate and timely updates on Alta Ski Resort's operating status?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the accuracy and timeliness of OnTheSnow.com's updates on Alta Ski Resort's operating status are somewhat questionable.\n\n- One source mentions that OnTheSnow.com's future forecasts are not as reliable as some other sources, although it is still a favorite for updated snow accumulations and other current conditions[5].\n- Another source indicates that the snow conditions and snowfall data at Alta Ski Area are sourced directly from the ski resort itself, which might have a vested interest in presenting the data in a certain light[5].\n\nHowever, there is no specific information provided that directly addresses the historical accuracy and timeliness of OnTheSnow.com's updates on Alta Ski Resort's operating status, such as lift openings, closures, or other operational details.\n\nGiven this, the answer would be:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is significant snowfall forecasted for Alta Ski Resort between November 12 and November 22, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is indication of potential snowfall for Alta Ski Resort between November 12 and November 22, 2024.\n\n- The OpenSnow forecast indicates that there is a chance for accumulating snow, with 3 inches of new snow forecasted in the next 48 hours and a total of 5 inches expected over the next 7 days[2][3].\n- The J2Ski snow forecast also shows predictions of snowfall during this period, with specific amounts forecasted for various days leading up to November 22[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Alta Ski Resort received sufficient snowfall to support ski operations as of November 12, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 12, 2024, Alta Ski Resort has not received sufficient snowfall to support ski operations. Here are the key points:\n\n- The resort is scheduled to open on November 22, 2024, indicating that it is not yet open[1].\n- Currently, none of the lifts are open, and the resort runs are closed[1].\n- While there has been some snowfall, including the first significant snowfall of the 2024-25 winter season on September 17, the current snow conditions are not sufficient to support ski operations[2][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any reported operational issues at Alta Ski Resort that could delay its opening for the 2024-2025 season?\nANSWER: There are no reported operational issues that are likely to delay the opening of Alta Ski Resort for the 2024-2025 season. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Supreme lift, which is facing issues due to accelerated metal fatigue, is expected to continue operating for the upcoming winter with necessary repairs or replacements, and any major modifications are planned for summer 2025[3].\n- Other upgrades and improvements, such as the installation of new Sunkid conveyor belts, improvements to traverses, and the construction of a new Ski Patrol building, do not indicate any potential delays to the opening date[2][5].\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, there are no reported operational issues that would delay the opening of Alta Ski Resort for the 2024-2025 season.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Alta Ski Resort historically been open by November 22 in previous ski seasons?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is unclear whether Alta Ski Resort has historically been open by November 22 in previous ski seasons.\n\n- The sources provide specific opening dates for recent seasons, but these dates vary:\n  - For the 2023-24 season, Alta opened on November 25, 2023[4].\n  - For the 2022-23 season, Alta opened on November 18, 2022[4].\n  - For the 2021-22 season, Alta opened on November 24, 2021[4].\n  - For the 2020-21 season, Alta opened on November 21, 2020[4].\n\nSince the opening dates have varied and not consistently been on or before November 22, we cannot definitively say that Alta has historically been open by this date.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any ongoing construction or maintenance at Alta Ski Resort that could impact its opening date?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several ongoing and planned construction and maintenance projects at Alta Ski Resort that could potentially impact its operations or specific facilities, although they may not necessarily delay the overall opening date of the resort.\n\n- The Supreme Lift is undergoing significant evaluation and planning for major modifications due to accelerated metal fatigue. The project, which includes either rebuilding the lift in a straight path or adding a full angle station, is targeted for summer 2025, but the lift will continue to operate with necessary repairs for the 2024-25 season[2][4].\n- Various other projects are underway, including the expansion of the Albion Day Lodge, construction of a new Ski Patrol building at the Sugarloaf Lift, installation of Remote Avalanche Control Systems, and several terrain improvements such as the regrading of the High-Mambo ski run and adjustments to the Ballroom Traverse. These projects are part of Alta’s Master Development Plan and may be ongoing during the upcoming season[1][5].\n\nWhile these projects are significant, they are generally planned to be completed in phases and are not expected to delay the opening of the resort as a whole. However, they could impact specific areas or facilities within the resort.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time until outcome:** 10 days remain until November 22, 2024.\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:** If conditions stay as they are—with insufficient snowfall and the resort currently closed—Alta Ski Resort would not open on November 22, 2024. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast with a quarter of the time left (2.5 days):** With only 2.5 days remaining and current conditions unchanged, the probability of sufficient snowfall occurring in that short window is low. I would estimate the probability of the resort opening on time to be around **20%**.\n\n(d) **Forecast with four times the time left (40 days):** With 40 days to go, there's a much higher chance of accumulating sufficient snowfall. Historical data suggests that significant snow can fall in that timeframe. I would estimate the probability at around **60%**.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Conditions:** As of November 12, 2024, Alta Ski Resort has not received sufficient snowfall to support ski operations. The lifts are closed, and the resort runs are not open.\n\n- **Snowfall Forecast:** There is a forecast of approximately 5 inches of new snow over the next 7 days. While this is promising, it may not be enough to ensure the resort can open by November 22.\n\n- **Historical Opening Dates:** The resort's opening dates over the past four seasons varied:\n  - **2023-24:** November 25\n  - **2022-23:** November 18\n  - **2021-22:** November 24\n  - **2020-21:** November 21\n  This indicates that opening on or before November 22 happens roughly 50% of the time.\n\n- **Other Resorts:** Several other major ski resorts in Utah are scheduled to open on or before November 22, suggesting regional readiness but not guaranteeing Alta's status.\n\n- **Operational Factors:** There are no reported operational issues or regulatory concerns likely to delay the opening. However, the opening is heavily dependent on natural snowfall.\n\nGiven the limited time until the scheduled opening, the current insufficient snow conditions, and the moderate snowfall forecasted, there is a less-than-even chance that Alta Ski Resort will be listed as open on November 22, 2024, by OnTheSnow's Ski Report.\n\n**Probability: 40%**",
