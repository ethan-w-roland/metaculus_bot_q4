If Ding forfeits the match the question will resolve as **Yes**, as long as FIDE announces that Gukesh is the new world champion.\n\nOtherwise, if the match is cancelled or postponed to after December 31, 2024, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of 2024, the [world chess champion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_2024) is determined by a match of 14 games between the current world champion and the winner of the Candidates tournament. In the previous world chess championship in 2023, Ding Liren defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi in a nerve-wracking match. The match featured 6 decisive classical games over the board, more than all such matches since 1996, and was decided in the last minutes of the fourth tie-break game.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Gukesh Dommaraju winning the 2024 World Chess Championship, here are some key points and background information:\n\n## Player Profiles and Recent Performance\n- Gukesh Dommaraju, an 18-year-old Indian grandmaster, has had a meteoric rise in the chess world. He won the 2024 Candidates Tournament, a significant achievement that qualifies him to challenge for the world title. Gukesh is known for his creative, aggressive, and fearless style, which could pose a significant challenge to more experienced players.\n- Ding Liren, the reigning world champion, is a 32-year-old Chinese grandmaster. He is recognized for his solid positional play, resilience in defense, and ability to handle high-pressure situations. Despite his experience and strategic depth, Ding has recently experienced a drop in form and rating points, particularly noted during the 2024 FIDE Chess Olympiad.\n\n## Ratings and Current Form\n- As of October 2024, Gukesh has a FIDE rating of 2794, placing him as the world's number 5, while Ding Liren has a rating of 2728, significantly lower than Gukesh's current rating. This gap has widened recently, with Gukesh gaining 30 rating points and Ding losing 8 points during the Olympiad.\n\n## Head-to-Head Record\n- The two players have a limited head-to-head record at classical time controls, with Ding winning two games and one draw. However, this record may not fully reflect their current form and abilities.\n\n## Betting Odds and Predictions\n- Betting odds and chess community predictions suggest that Gukesh has a high probability of winning. Estimates range from around 65% to as high as 90% for Gukesh to win the match before tiebreaks, reflecting his current form and rating advantage.\n\n## Key Factors\n- **Opening Preparation**: Gukesh needs to be prepared for Ding's deep opening preparation to gain an early edge.\n- **Experience vs. Innovation**: The contrast between Ding's experience in long-form matches and Gukesh's youthful creativity and energy could be crucial.\n- **Mental Toughness**: Gukesh's ability to handle the pressure of the World Championship, which is different from the Candidates Tournament, will be a key factor.\n\nGiven these points, while it is not possible to definitively answer the question with a yes or no, the current evidence suggests that Gukesh Dommaraju has a significant advantage due to his recent form, rating, and aggressive playing style. However, Ding Liren's experience and ability to handle pressure should not be underestimated, and the outcome remains uncertain until the match is played.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any chess player aged 18 or younger ever won the World Chess Championship before 2024?\nANSWER: No, before 2024, no chess player aged 18 or younger has won the World Chess Championship.

For example, his draw against Hikaru Nakamura in a crucial game was enough to secure his victory, despite the pressure and complexity of the game.\n\n2. **Chess Olympiad Performance**: Gukesh's performance at the 2024 Chess Olympiad, where he achieved a remarkable 9/10 score and a high performance rating, further highlights his ability to perform well under pressure. This achievement is described as one of the most outstanding individual performances in Chess Olympiad history.\n\n3. **Interview Insights**: In an interview, Gukesh discussed the pressure he faced in obtaining his grandmaster title at a young age and how he learned to handle such pressures. He mentioned that he valued the record highly and put himself under a lot of pressure, but ultimately learned how to manage these pressures effectively.\n\nThese examples collectively indicate that Gukesh Dommaraju is indeed known for performing exceptionally well under high-pressure situations.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Ding Liren exhibited any decline in performance or health issues in 2024 that could affect his play in the upcoming World Chess Championship?\nANSWER: Yes, Ding Liren has exhibited both a decline in performance and health issues that could affect his play in the upcoming World Chess Championship.\n\n### Performance Decline\n- Ding Liren's recent tournament performances have been below his usual standards. For example, he finished with a performance rating below 2680 in his last three tournaments, including a disappointing result at the Sinquefield Cup where he lost 8.5 more rating points.\n- His performance at the 2024 Olympiad was also notable for squandering a winning position against Vietnamese GM Le Quang Liem, indicating some instability in his game.\n\n### Health and Mental Issues\n- After becoming the World Champion in April 2023, Ding took a nine-month break from chess to focus on his mental health, citing personal difficulties and depression.\n- He has been seeing a psychologist and has mentioned that he does not feel he is playing at the same level as he used to.

    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nApproximately 1 to 2 months remaining until the outcome is known, as the 2024 World Chess Championship match is expected to conclude before December 31, 2024.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed from the current situation, Gukesh Dommaraju is favored to win the match and become the 2024 World Chess Champion.\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately one week), I would forecast a slightly higher probability of Gukesh winning, due to reduced time for any significant changes affecting the outcome.\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there was four times the time left (approximately four months), I would forecast a slightly lower probability of Gukesh winning, as increased time allows for potential changes in form, health, or preparation for both players.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 1, 2024, Gukesh Dommaraju is in exceptional form, holding a FIDE rating of 2794, which places him as the world's number 5. This rating surpasses Ding Liren's rating of 2728 by a significant margin of 66 points. Gukesh's recent achievements include winning the 2024 FIDE Candidates Tournament and delivering an outstanding performance at the 2024 Chess Olympiad, where he gained 30 rating points and achieved a performance rating of 3056. His aggressive and creative playing style, coupled with his ability to perform exceptionally well under high-pressure situations, positions him as a strong contender for the World Championship title.\n\nConversely, Ding Liren, the reigning world champion, has experienced a decline in form and rating. He has lost 8 rating points recently and has been open about his mental health struggles, including depression after his 2023 World Championship win. His performance in recent tournaments has been below his usual standards, and he has acknowledged not playing at the same level as before.\n\nBetting odds and chess community predictions favor Gukesh, with estimates ranging from a 65% to as high as a 90% chance of him winning the match before tiebreaks. This reflects the general consensus that Gukesh's current form gives him a significant advantage.\n\nHowever, several factors suggest that the outcome is not certain:\n\n- **Experience:** Ding Liren has extensive experience in world-class matches and has demonstrated resilience under high-pressure situations, such as his narrow victory in the 2023 World Championship.\n\n- **Head-to-Head Record:** Ding leads in their classical head-to-head games, with two wins and one draw against Gukesh. This suggests that Ding has had success against Gukesh's playing style in the past.\n\n- **Preparation:** Ding is known for his deep opening preparation and solid positional play. With a strong team of seconds and coaches, he may adjust his strategies effectively against Gukesh.\n\n- **Youth and Pressure:** While Gukesh has shown composure in high-stakes tournaments like the Candidates and the Olympiad, the World Championship match is a unique challenge. The psychological pressure of potentially becoming the youngest world champion in history could impact his performance.\n\n- **Potential Recovery:** Increased time could allow Ding to address his health issues and regain form, making the match more competitive.\n\nConsidering these factors, while Gukesh is the favorite to win based on current form and rating, there remains a substantial chance that Ding Liren could defend his title using his experience and strategic depth. Therefore, the probability of Gukesh winning is high but not certain.\n\n**Probability: 70%**",
