    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Kalshi outrank Coinbase in the top free Finance apps on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, on December 31, 2024, according to the Apple App Store at [this link](https://apps.apple.com/us/charts/iphone/finance-apps/6015?chart=top-free), on or after December 31, 2024 Kalshi has a higher rank than Coinbase when accessed by Metaculus Admins. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. In case of the resolution source being down, Metaculus Admins will wait until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nOn October 11, 2024, the CEO of Kalshi [tweeted](https://x.com/mansourtarek_/status/1844770826446319930) that Kalshi's app had surpassed Coinbase in the rankings, in the wake of Kalshi enabling betting on the US election. A day later, Coinbase had again taken the lead over the Kalshi app, so this question looks at whether the initial momentum continues or fades. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Kalshi outranking Coinbase in the top free Finance apps by December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Current Position and Popularity\n- Coinbase is a well-established and highly popular cryptocurrency exchange platform. It has a strong user base and is widely recognized in the financial and cryptocurrency markets.\n\n## Recent Performance and Innovations\n- Coinbase has shown strong financial results and significant product innovations, including the launch of Coinbase International Exchange, Base, smart wallets, and partnerships with major companies like Stripe. These developments have contributed to its growth and user engagement.\n\n## Market Presence and User Base\n- Coinbase has a large and diverse user base, including both individual consumers and institutional clients. It has been selected by major ETF issuers and has a significant presence in the institutional trading market.\n\n## Competition and Market Dynamics\n- The finance app market is highly competitive, with many other apps vying for top spots. However, Coinbase's brand recognition, user trust, and continuous innovation make it a strong contender to maintain its position.\n\n## Kalshi's Position\n- There is no provided information on Kalshi's current market position, user base, or recent performance in the context of the top free Finance apps. Without specific data on Kalshi's growth, user adoption, and market impact, it is challenging to predict whether it could outrank Coinbase.\n\n## Predictive Factors\n- To make an informed prediction, one would need to consider factors such as Kalshi's current ranking, its rate of user growth, any significant innovations or partnerships, and overall market trends. Without this information, it is difficult to determine if Kalshi has the momentum to surpass Coinbase.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data on Kalshi's performance and the strong position of Coinbase, it is not clear whether Kalshi will outrank Coinbase by December 31, 2024. This question cannot be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" without additional context and data on Kalshi's market standing and growth trajectory.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi's app ever outranked Coinbase in the top free Finance apps on the Apple App Store as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information that compares the rankings of Kalshi and Coinbase in the top free Finance apps on the Apple App Store as of October 2023. The sources provide details about the features and functionalities of both apps but do not include ranking data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi announced plans to enable betting on the US presidential election before December 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nKalshi has announced plans to enable betting on the US presidential election. Following the appeals court's decision, Kalshi indicated that it would start accepting bets on the presidential election, with a notice on their platform showing a countdown clock and a \"Notify me\" link for users to be informed when betting on the presidential election would commence.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are prediction market apps like Kalshi gaining popularity relative to cryptocurrency apps like Coinbase as of October 2023?\nANSWER: The information provided does not directly compare the popularity of prediction market apps like Kalshi to cryptocurrency apps like Coinbase as of October 2023. The sources discuss the growth and activity of prediction markets, particularly in the context of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, but they do not provide a direct comparison to the popularity of cryptocurrency apps during that specific time period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the 2024 US presidential election expected to drive significant user engagement for apps like Kalshi?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically mention Kalshi or its expectations regarding user engagement for the 2024 US presidential election. However, they do indicate that the 2024 US presidential election is driving significant user engagement for various news and election-related apps and platforms.\n\nFor example, the sources mention increased user traffic and engagement on news platforms such as WSJ, CNN, and X.com during recent political events related to the 2024 election.\n\nGiven the general trend of increased engagement on election-related platforms, it is plausible that apps like Kalshi, if they are involved in election-related content or services, could also see significant user engagement. However, without specific information about Kalshi, the answer remains:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi received significant new funding or investment that could accelerate its growth before December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Kalshi has received significant new funding and investment that could accelerate its growth before December 2024. Here are the details:\n\n- Kalshi has secured tens of millions of dollars in short-term loans from investors, including $12.4 million from VC firm Neo and its founder Ali Pavroti, to ensure it can provide instant funding for customers betting on the U.S. election.\n- The company is also in discussions with new and existing investors about raising a formal equity round of as much as $50 million or more.\n- This influx of capital is intended to support Kalshi's rapid growth, particularly in anticipation of additional betting on the U.S. election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Coinbase consistently ranked among the top 10 free Finance apps on the Apple App Store as of October 2023?\nANSWER: No, Coinbase was not consistently ranked among the top 10 free Finance apps on the Apple App Store as of October 2023. According to the sources, in December 2023, Coinbase's app ranking among Finance iPhone apps peaked at 16th place but then fell back down.\n\nAs of October 2023, Coinbase was not in the top 10; it was actually ranked much lower. For instance, it was mentioned that Coinbase ranked 62nd among iOS \"Personal Finance\" apps in November 2023, and it started the year 2024 ranking at 489th before rising.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Kalshi recently introduced significant new features that could significantly increase its user adoption by December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Kalshi has recently introduced significant new features that could potentially increase its user adoption by December 2024.\n\n- Kalshi has launched crypto deposits, allowing users to fund their accounts with the stablecoin USDC, which is expected to make transactions faster and cheaper compared to traditional bank transfers. This feature is enabled through a partnership with the crypto firm Zero Hash.\n- Additionally, Kalshi has introduced political betting markets, including bets on the U.S. Presidential Election, after winning a lawsuit against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to allow such markets. This expansion into political contracts is a significant new feature.\n\nThese developments aim to enhance user experience and attract more users, especially in the context of the 2024 election cycle.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Kalshi have a smaller user base than Coinbase as of October 2023?\nANSWER: To determine if Kalshi has a smaller user base than Coinbase as of October 2023, we need to look at the available data on the user bases of both platforms.\n\n### Kalshi\n- Kalshi is described as the first and largest legally sanctioned prediction market in the United States, but specific user base numbers are not provided in the sources. However, it is mentioned that Kalshi has recorded over $100 million in trading volume in under a month and has launched political betting markets recently.\n\n### Coinbase\n- Coinbase is a well-established cryptocurrency exchange with a significant user base. As of the sources provided, Coinbase is known to have a large customer base, including over 400,000 self-directed accounts, although this specific figure is from the context of StoneX and its operations, it indicates the scale of Coinbase's user base given its prominence in the crypto market.\n\nGiven the lack of specific user base numbers for Kalshi and the known large user base of Coinbase, it is reasonable to infer that Kalshi likely has a smaller user base compared to Coinbase as of October 2023.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming regulatory changes that could negatively impact Coinbase's app usage by December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are upcoming regulatory changes that could negatively impact Coinbase's app usage by December 2024.\n\n1. **MiCA Regulation**: The European Union's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which will be fully enforced by December 2024, requires stablecoin issuers to comply with stringent standards around transparency, liquidity, and consumer protection. Coinbase plans to delist non-compliant stablecoins from its European platforms by the end of December 2024 to align with these regulations.\n\n2. **Compliance and Transition**: Coinbase will restrict services for EEA users related to stablecoins that do not comply with MiCA by December 30, 2024. The platform will offer users the option to transition to compliant stablecoins, such as Circle’s USDC and EURC, starting in November 2024.\n\nThese changes could impact the availability and usage of certain stablecoins on Coinbase's platform in the European Economic Area (EEA).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Coinbase faced any significant legal or regulatory challenges that could impact its app rankings by December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Coinbase has faced significant legal and regulatory challenges that could potentially impact its operations and reputation, which in turn could affect its app rankings by December 2024.\n\nHere are some key points:\n\n- **SEC Lawsuit**: The SEC has launched a major lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging that it operated as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The court has denied Coinbase's motion for judgment on the pleadings, suggesting that the SEC's allegations plausibly support the claim that Coinbase operated as an unregistered intermediary of securities.\n\n- **Regulatory Fines and Compliance Issues**: Coinbase has been fined $50 million by New York regulators for failing to prevent money laundering on its platform. Additionally, it faced a $6.5 million civil monetary penalty from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for reckless false, misleading, or inaccurate reporting and wash trading.\n\n- **Customer Trust and Security Breaches**: There have been issues with how Coinbase treats customers, including security breaches and a lack of responsibility for losses stemming from these breaches. This has led to a loss of customer trust, reflected in low Trustpilot reviews.\n\n- **Bankruptcy Risk Disclosure**: Coinbase has disclosed in its quarterly report that if the company were to file for bankruptcy, customer assets might be treated as Coinbase’s assets, potentially leaving customers at the back of the line for repayment.\n\nThese ongoing legal and regulatory challenges could impact user confidence and the overall reputation of Coinbase, which in turn could affect its app rankings.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of today's date, November 6, 2024, there are approximately **55 days** until December 31, 2024, when the outcome will be determined.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and December 31, 2024, **Kalshi would not outrank Coinbase** in the top free Finance apps on the Apple App Store. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about **14 days** left until December 31, 2024, I would forecast a **lower probability** of Kalshi outranking Coinbase due to the limited time for significant shifts in app rankings.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **220 days** remaining, I would forecast a **higher probability** that Kalshi could overtake Coinbase, given the extended time for Kalshi's recent initiatives to impact app rankings.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Current App Store Rankings:**\n\n   - As of now, **Coinbase** maintains a higher ranking than **Kalshi** in the Apple App Store's top free Finance apps. Specific ranking numbers are not provided, but based on historical data and the prominence of Coinbase, it is reasonable to assume Coinbase is ahead.\n\n2. **Kalshi's Recent Developments:**\n\n   - **Political Betting Markets:** Kalshi has recently launched political betting markets, including on the U.S. Presidential Election, after a legal victory against the CFTC. This could attract a surge of users interested in election betting.\n   - **Crypto Deposits:** The introduction of crypto deposits via USDC could appeal to crypto-savvy users, potentially boosting downloads.\n   - **Funding and Growth:** Kalshi has secured significant funding (tens of millions in short-term loans and discussions for up to $50 million in equity funding) aimed at supporting rapid growth and user acquisition.\n\n3. **Coinbase's Challenges:**\n\n   - **Regulatory Issues:** Coinbase is facing significant legal challenges, including a lawsuit from the SEC and compliance adjustments due to the EU's MiCA regulations.\n   - **User Trust Concerns:** Legal troubles and fines may erode user trust, potentially impacting app downloads and engagement.\n\n4. **Market Dynamics:**\n\n   - **Election-Driven Engagement:** The upcoming 2024 U.S. Presidential Election is likely to drive increased interest in political betting platforms like Kalshi.\n   - **Competition in Finance Apps:** The finance app market is competitive, but significant events can shift user attention rapidly.\n\n5. **Time Constraints:**\n\n   - With only **55 days** left, the window for Kalshi to overtake Coinbase is narrow.\n   - App Store rankings are influenced by download velocity, user engagement, and reviews. A substantial marketing push or viral growth would be needed.\n\n6. **Base Rates and Historical Trends:**\n\n   - Rapid rises in app rankings have occurred, especially around major events.\n   - However, overtaking a well-established app like Coinbase requires significant momentum.\n\n7. **Potential Scenarios:**\n\n   - **Optimistic Scenario:** Kalshi leverages the election excitement, combined with aggressive marketing and the appeal of new features, leading to a spike in downloads and higher ranking.\n   - **Pessimistic Scenario:** Despite new features, Kalshi's growth is insufficient to surpass Coinbase due to brand recognition and user loyalty towards Coinbase.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the limited time frame and the current rankings, while there is a possibility for Kalshi to outrank Coinbase due to its recent initiatives and the upcoming election, the probability is moderate. The strength of Coinbase's brand and user base, combined with the short window of time, makes it challenging for Kalshi to overtake.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 30%**",
