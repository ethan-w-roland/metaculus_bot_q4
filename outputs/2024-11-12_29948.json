    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the US sanction Venezuelan oil again by 2025?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-12\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThe question resolves Yes if, before January 1, 2025, credible sources report that sanctions on Venezuelan oil have been (re)imposed by the United States.\n\nAny imposition or reimposition of sanctions that were not in effect on December 15, 2023, will be sufficient for resolution. This includes a reversal of the Biden-administration's sanction relief.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-easing-venezuela-oil-sanctions-response-election-deal-official-2023-10-18/):\n\n> The Biden administration...broadly eased sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector in response to a deal reached between the government and opposition parties for the 2024 election - the most extensive rollback of Trump-era restrictions on Caracas.\n\n> A new general license issued by the U.S. Treasury Department authorized OPEC member Venezuela, which had been under crushing sanctions since 2019, to produce and export oil to its chosen markets for the next six months without limitation.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the US reimposing or maintaining sanctions on Venezuelan oil by 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Sanctions Status\nAs of April 2024, the US has reimposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil and gas sector due to the Maduro government's failure to comply with the terms of the Barbados Agreement, which included allowing free and fair elections and not intimidating opposition candidates[2][4][5].\n\n## General License 44A\nThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued General License 44A, which requires the wind down of transactions involving Venezuela's state-owned energy company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PdVSA), by May 31, 2024. This license supersedes the previous General License 44, which had temporarily eased sanctions on the oil and gas sector[1][2][5].\n\n## Conditions for Sanctions Relief\nThe Biden administration has indicated that sanctions relief could be reinstated if the Maduro government adheres to democratic reforms, particularly allowing all opposition candidates to run unencumbered in the upcoming presidential election. However, as of now, the Maduro regime has not met these conditions[2][4].\n\n## Ongoing Evaluations\nThe US government will continue to assess sanctions policy towards Venezuela based on the actions taken by the Maduro government, especially in the context of the July 28, 2024, presidential elections. This suggests that the sanctions policy is subject to change based on Venezuela's compliance with democratic norms[1][4].\n\n## Historical Context\nThe US has a history of imposing and easing sanctions on Venezuela in response to political developments. Sanctions have been a tool to pressure the Maduro government to reform, but they have also been adjusted to balance geopolitical and economic considerations[3].\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- **Historical Precedent**: The US has frequently adjusted sanctions on Venezuela in response to political and economic conditions.\n- **Current Political Climate**: The reimposition of sanctions in April 2024 indicates a strong stance against the Maduro government's undemocratic actions.\n- **Economic Considerations**: The impact on global oil prices and migration from Venezuela are significant factors in US policy decisions.\n\nGiven these points, it is not immediately clear whether the US will maintain or lift sanctions on Venezuelan oil by 2025. The decision will likely depend on the Maduro government's actions regarding democratic reforms and the outcome of the July 2024 presidential elections. The US government's willingness to reassess sanctions on a case-by-case basis and in response to changing conditions in Venezuela adds to the uncertainty.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of November 2024, are US sanctions on Venezuelan oil in effect?\nANSWER: As of November 2024, yes, US sanctions on Venezuelan oil are in effect.\n\nOn April 17, 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) replaced General License (GL) 44, which had authorized transactions related to oil and gas sector operations in Venezuela, with GL 44A. This new license allows only for the wind-down of previously authorized transactions by May 31, 2024, and does not permit new transactions[3][4][5].\n\nSince the wind-down period has expired as of May 31, 2024, the sanctions on Venezuelan oil sector operations are now back in effect.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the US government issue General License 44A requiring the wind down of transactions with PdVSA by May 31, 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe US government issued General License 44A (GL 44A) on April 17, 2024, which authorizes the wind down of transactions related to oil and gas sector operations in Venezuela, including those involving Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), by 12:01 a.m. EDT on May 31, 2024[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the US reimpose sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector in April 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe US reimposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector in April 2024. This is confirmed by several sources:\n\n- The OFAC issued General License 44A on April 17, 2024, which authorized the wind-down of transactions related to oil or gas sector operations in Venezuela that were previously authorized by GL 44, indicating the end of the temporary sanctions relief[1].\n- The Biden administration decided not to renew the oil sector license due to the Maduro government's failure to comply with commitments towards holding free and fair elections, effectively reimposing oil sanctions[3].\n- The CRS report also mentions that the Administration did not renew the oil sector license in April 2024, citing the Maduro government’s continued violations of electoral conditions[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the United States reimposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil since December 15, 2023?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe United States reimposed sanctions on the Venezuelan oil sector after the Maduro government failed to meet the conditions for free and fair elections. Here are the key points:\n\n- In October 2023, some U.S. sanctions on the oil and gas industries were temporarily lifted in exchange for promises of democratic reforms and the release of political prisoners[5].\n- However, in April 2024, the Biden administration reimposed sanctions on PdVSA and the Venezuelan energy sector due to the Maduro government's interference in the presidential election, including the disqualification of opposition candidates and other political intimidation tactics[3][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Biden administration indicated that sanctions relief will be reinstated only if the Maduro government adheres to democratic reforms?\nANSWER: Yes, the Biden administration has indicated that sanctions relief on Venezuela is contingent on the Maduro government adhering to democratic reforms.\n\n- The administration eased sanctions in October 2023 after an agreement in Barbados that included a roadmap toward holding competitive elections. However, it was made clear that if the Maduro government did not fulfill its commitments, such as releasing political prisoners, establishing a process to consider the requalification of banned opposition leaders, and making progress in election organization, the U.S. would reconsider and potentially reinstate the sanctions[2][3][4].\n\n- When the Maduro government failed to comply with these terms, including disqualifying opposition candidates and repressing opposition figures, the Biden administration decided to reinstate the oil and gas sanctions[3][4].\n\nThis indicates that the sanctions relief is conditional on the Maduro government's adherence to democratic reforms and election commitments.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Maduro government failed to comply with the terms of the Barbados Agreement, including allowing free and fair elections?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe Maduro government has failed to comply with several key terms of the Barbados Agreement, particularly those related to ensuring free and fair elections. Here are some specific violations:\n\n- The Maduro government disqualified the leading opposition candidate, María Corina Machado, from the 2024 presidential election through a ruling by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, which did not follow due legal process and violated the spirit of the agreement[2][3][4].\n\n- The government has arrested and issued arrest warrants for opposition leaders and campaign team members on unsubstantiated charges, which undermines the commitment to a fair electoral process[3][4].\n\n- The electoral timetable announced by the Maduro government's electoral council allows only a short period for candidate registration and voter registration, making it difficult for international election observation teams to monitor the elections effectively[4].\n\n- The government has continued to crack down on critics and violate human rights, including the detention of activists like Rocío San Miguel, which further erodes the conditions necessary for free and fair elections[4][5].\n\nThese actions indicate a significant failure to comply with the terms of the Barbados Agreement.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the July 28, 2024, Venezuelan presidential election fail to meet US expectations for democratic norms?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe sources indicate that the July 28, 2024, Venezuelan presidential election did not meet US expectations for democratic norms. Here are some key points:\n\n- The Maduro government violated several key provisions of the Barbados Agreement, which included commitments related to the timing and conduct of the election, access to media, reform of the voter registry, and candidate security[1].\n- The opposition was unable to register its chosen nominee, and the electoral process was marked by restrictions and human rights violations[1][4].\n- International observation was limited, with the Maduro government revoking the invitation to the European Union Electoral Observation Mission and only allowing a few technical observation missions, such as those from the Carter Center and the UN Panel of Electoral Experts[4].\n- The election was characterized by concerns over its fairness, with the Maduro regime engaging in tactics to clear the field and undermine the opposition's chances[2][4].\n\nThese factors suggest that the election did not align with US expectations for free and fair democratic processes.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of November 2024, have there been any changes to US sanctions policy toward Venezuela's oil sector?\nANSWER: As of November 2024, there have been significant changes to the US sanctions policy toward Venezuela's oil sector.\n\n1. **Revoke and Wind Down of General License 44**: On April 17, 2024, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued General License 44A, which replaced and superseded General License 44. This new license requires the wind down of all transactions related to oil or gas sector operations in Venezuela that were previously authorized by GL 44, to be completed by May 31, 2024[1][2][5].\n\n2. **Prohibited Transactions**: GL 44A prohibits new investments, increasing production, and other activities that do not demonstrate a consistent reduction in activities. It also continues to prohibit transactions involving entities owned or controlled by persons in Russia and certain other restricted activities[1][2][5].\n\n3. **Reason for Changes**: The changes were made due to the Maduro government's failure to adhere to the conditions of the Barbados Agreement, including the disqualification of opposition candidates and other signs of electoral interference[4][5].\n\nThese updates indicate that the US sanctions policy has indeed been modified to reflect a stricter stance on Venezuela's oil sector as of November 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there credible sources reporting that the US has reimposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil that were not in effect on December 15, 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, there are credible sources reporting that the US has reimposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil that were not in effect on December 15, 2023.\n\n- On April 17, 2024, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) released General License 44A, which effectively ended the previous general license (GL 44) that had allowed transactions in the Venezuelan oil and gas sector. This move required companies to wind down their operations with PdVSA by May 31, 2024[3][5].\n- This action was taken due to the Maduro government's failure to adhere to the conditions of the Barbados Agreement, including allowing all opposition candidates to run unencumbered in the elections[3][5].\n- The reimposition of these sanctions means that the temporary relief provided by GL 44, which was in effect as of December 15, 2023, has been revoked[3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a history of the US reimposing sanctions on Venezuela in response to political developments?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a history of the US reimposing or adjusting sanctions on Venezuela in response to various political developments.\n\n- In 2015, under the Obama administration, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and entities in response to human rights abuses and repression during protests, as part of the Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act[2][4][5].\n- During the Trump administration, sanctions were expanded and adjusted multiple times. For example, in August 2017, the US prohibited U.S. citizens from purchasing Venezuelan government debt, and in May 2018, they blocked the purchase of Venezuelan debt and any debt owed to Venezuela pledged as collateral. These actions were part of a broader strategy to pressure Maduro's government[2][3][4].\n- In 2019, during the Venezuelan presidential crisis, the US imposed additional economic sanctions targeting the petroleum, gold, mining, and banking industries, as well as the state-owned oil company PDVSA. These sanctions were aimed at pressuring Maduro to resign[1][2][3].\n- In August 2019, President Trump issued an executive order freezing the assets of the Maduro government in the US and prohibiting US persons from engaging in transactions with the Maduro government, further tightening the sanctions[3].\n- The sanctions were adjusted again in 2022, when the US issued licenses to ease some restrictions, such as allowing Chevron to resume oil production in Venezuela, in response to progress in democratization talks between the Venezuelan opposition and the government[4].\n\nThese adjustments and reimpositions of sanctions were often in response to specific political developments and the ongoing crisis in Venezuela.",
