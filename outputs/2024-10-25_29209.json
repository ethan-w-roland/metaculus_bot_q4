{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after September 30, 2024, and before January 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements[here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before January 1, 2025, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the Federal Reserve's [target funds rate history page](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the most recent rate cuts were on September 19, 2024, after a few years of relatively higher and rising interest rates. Previous cuts were on March 16, 2020, and March 3, 2020. Before then, there were three separate rate cuts in 2019.  \n\nThe September 2024 FOMC meeting is [scheduled](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/02/12/what-to-expect-from-the-feds-remaining-meetings-of-2024) for September 18th. \n\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information available, it is highly likely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again before January 1, 2025. Here are some key points that support this prediction:\n\n## Projections and Signals\n- The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has already cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024, and projections indicate further cuts. The FOMC expects another 50 basis points in cuts by the end of 2024.\n\n## Economic Conditions\n- The Fed has signaled that it will continue to lower rates as long as inflation continues to ease and the labor market shows signs of weakening. Current projections suggest that inflation is expected to fall closer to the Fed's 2% target, and the unemployment rate, though slightly higher, is still within manageable levels.\n\n## Market Expectations\n- Experts and market analysts anticipate at least one more interest rate cut this year, aligning with the Fed's projections. The Fed's 'dot plot' also suggests a total of one percentage point cuts by the end of 2025, indicating a continued downward trajectory for interest rates.\n\n## Flexibility in Monetary Policy\n- Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized the flexibility of the Fed's plans, stating that they can adjust the pace of rate cuts based on economic conditions. This suggests that if economic indicators continue to support further easing, the Fed is likely to proceed with additional rate cuts.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates again before January 1, 2025.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the Federal Reserve's latest dot plot projections indicate additional rate cuts in 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's latest dot plot projections, as outlined in the sources, indicate that there will be additional rate cuts in 2024. Specifically, the projections suggest another 50 basis points of rate cuts in 2024, which could be implemented through one or two additional rate cuts by the end of the year.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Federal Reserve scheduled to have any FOMC meetings between October 25, 2024, and December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the Federal Reserve is scheduled to have FOMC meetings between October 25, 2024, and December 31, 2024. Here are the relevant meeting dates:\n\n- November 6-7, 2024\n- December 17-18, 2024\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Reserve historically cut interest rates in the fourth quarter after a September rate cut?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that the Federal Reserve has signaled intentions to cut interest rates further in the fourth quarter of 2024 following the September rate cut.\n\n- The sources indicate that the Fed has planned additional rate cuts, with projections suggesting a half-point cut before the end of the year and further cuts in 2025.\n- Specifically, Fed officials signaled plans to cut interest rates by another half a percentage point before the end of 2024, with two remaining meetings in November and December.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the unemployment rate increased in recent months?\nANSWER: Yes, the unemployment rate in the United States has increased in recent months, although with some fluctuations.\n\n- The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in July 2024 from 4.1% in the previous month, which was the highest since October 2021.\n- It then decreased to 4.2% in August 2024 and further to 4.1% in September 2024.\n- However, since April 2023, the unemployment rate has been gradually trending up, with an average increase of 5 basis points per month.\n\nThis indicates that while there have been monthly variations, there is an overall upward trend in the unemployment rate since April 2023.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Reserve publicly indicated plans to cut interest rates before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has publicly indicated plans to cut interest rates before January 1, 2025. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Fed cut the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024, bringing the new target range to 4.75-5 percent.\n- The Fed signaled expectations for further rate cuts, including an additional 50 basis points in cuts by the end of 2024.\n- Quarterly forecasts and the 'dot plot' indicate that a slim majority of officials anticipate further reductions, projecting cuts during the upcoming meetings in November and December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are financial markets pricing in a Federal Reserve rate cut before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe sources indicate that financial markets and the Federal Reserve itself are anticipating further rate cuts before January 1, 2025. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Federal Reserve has signaled potential further cuts, with projections indicating another 50 basis points of cuts by the end of 2024.\n- The Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) suggests that the Fed will cut interest rates gradually over the course of the next year, including additional cuts in 2024.\n- Specifically, there are expectations for two 25 basis points cuts, one in November and one in December 2024, or a single 50 basis points cut in December.\n\nThese indications suggest that financial markets are indeed pricing in the possibility of a Federal Reserve rate cut before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are market analysts predicting a Federal Reserve rate cut before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nMarket analysts and the Federal Reserve's own projections indicate that there will be rate cuts before January 1, 2025. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September 2024, bringing the rate to 4.75%-5.00%, and signaled potential further cuts by the end of 2024.\n- Projections suggest additional rate cuts of 50 basis points by the end of 2024 and a total of one percentage point in cuts by the end of 2025.\n- Market expectations, as indicated by federal-funds futures, also suggest multiple rate cuts in late 2024 and early 2025.\n\nThese sources collectively indicate that market analysts and the Federal Reserve are predicting rate cuts before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current rate of inflation below the Federal Reserve's target of 2%?\nANSWER: Based on the latest data provided in the sources, the current rate of inflation is not consistently below the Federal Reserve's target of 2%.\n\n- As of July 2024, the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCEPI), the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, grew at a continuously compounding annual rate of 1.9%, which is slightly below the 2% target.\n- However, other recent data indicate that the overall inflation rate is still around or slightly above the 2% target. For example, the current annual inflation rate is reported to be 2.4% as of recent updates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is not a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" across all sources, but it can be summarized as follows:\n\n- In some recent measurements, inflation is slightly below the target (1.9% PCEPI).\n- In other measurements, it is around or slightly above the target (2.4% annual inflation rate).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the global economic situation deteriorating in a way that might prompt the Federal Reserve to cut rates?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the global economic situation is complex and has various indicators, but it does not strongly suggest a deterioration that would necessarily prompt the Federal Reserve to cut rates.\n\n- The US job market is described as stronger than expected, with employment growing nearly three times faster than the labor force, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate.\n- While there are signs of economic slowdown in some regions, such as the eurozone, Japan, and China, the overall global economic outlook is not uniformly negative. For instance, the IMF forecasts a 3.2% growth for 2024-2025 and expects inflation to drop to 4.3% by 2025, indicating a potential for a smooth landing.\n- The Federal Reserve is already expected to cut rates by 25 basis points in November, driven more by the strong job growth and moderate economic indicators rather than a severe economic deterioration.\n\nTherefore, the current economic situation does not indicate a significant deterioration that would prompt an unexpected or drastic rate cut by the Federal Reserve.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are recent economic indicators pointing toward a slowing economy?\nANSWER: Recent economic indicators suggest several signs that could indicate a slowing economy, although the overall picture is mixed and not all indicators point to a recession or significant slowdown.\n\n## Key Indicators:\n- **Leading Economic Index (LEI):** The LEI for the U.S. has been declining, with a 0.2% drop in August 2024, and a 2.3% decline over the six months from February to August 2024. This decline is driven by factors such as new orders, a negative interest rate spread, and lower stock prices, which signal headwinds to economic growth.\n- **Unemployment Rate:** The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in July, triggering the Sahm rule, which is an indicator that could signal the onset of a recession. However, experts like Claudia Sahm and others argue that this does not necessarily mean a recession is imminent.\n- **Job Growth:** Weak job figures in July, with only 114,000 jobs added, fell short of expectations. This, combined with the rise in unemployment, has raised concerns about the labor market.\n- **Inflation and Interest Rates:** While inflation is declining, with the CPI below 3.0% in July, high interest rates and an inverted yield curve continue to be concerns. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates, which could support economic growth.\n- **Consumer Spending and Business Investment:** Despite some concerns, consumer spending remains robust, and business investment is high. Deloitte's forecast suggests that these factors will help maintain economic growth, albeit at a slower pace.\n- **Stock Market:** The stock market has seen some volatility, with a significant drop in tech stocks, but overall, major indexes like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones have been rising in 2024.\n\n## Conclusion:\nWhile there are indicators suggesting a slowdown, such as the declining LEI, rising unemployment, and weak job growth, other factors like robust consumer spending, high business investment, and declining inflation suggest that the economy is not yet in a recession. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**, recent economic indicators do point toward a slowing economy, but the overall situation is complex and does not definitively indicate a recession.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of October 25, 2024, there are 67 days remaining until January 1, 2025. This encompasses two scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings on November 6-7 and December 17-18, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current projections and signals from the Federal Reserve hold, and no unexpected economic shocks occur, the outcome would likely be **Yes**. The Fed has indicated plans for additional rate cuts before the end of 2024, and market expectations align with this.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only a quarter of the time left (approximately 17 days), the date would be around November 11, 2024. Given that the November FOMC meeting would have just occurred, the probability would depend on whether a rate cut was announced then. If not, with only one meeting left in December, the probability of a rate cut before January 1, 2025 would be slightly lower but still significant.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were four times the time left (approximately 268 days), this would extend beyond the question's cutoff date. However, considering a hypothetical scenario with more time until January 1, 2025 (which is fixed), the probability of a rate cut announcement before that date would be higher due to additional FOMC meetings and greater opportunity for economic conditions to prompt action.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Federal Reserve Signals:** The Fed has publicly indicated intentions to cut interest rates further before the end of 2024. The latest dot plot projections and statements from Fed officials suggest an additional 50 basis points in cuts are planned, which could occur at the upcoming November and December meetings.\n\n- **Scheduled FOMC Meetings:** There are two remaining FOMC meetings within the time frame of the question\u2014November 6-7 and December 17-18, 2024. These meetings provide opportunities for the Fed to announce rate cuts.\n\n- **Economic Indicators:**\n  - *Inflation:* Inflation rates are approaching the Fed's 2% target, with some measures slightly below and others slightly above. This creates room for the Fed to ease monetary policy.\n  - *Unemployment Rate:* The unemployment rate has shown an upward trend since April 2023, indicating a softening labor market, which the Fed may address through rate cuts.\n  - *Slowing Economy:* Indicators like the Leading Economic Index (LEI) have been declining, suggesting potential economic slowdown, which could prompt the Fed to lower rates to stimulate growth.\n\n- **Market Expectations and Analyst Predictions:** Both financial markets and analysts are anticipating further rate cuts. The federal funds futures market and expert analyses reflect expectations of at least one more rate cut before January 1, 2025.\n\n- **Historical Context:** Historically, the Fed has cut rates in consecutive meetings when adjusting monetary policy in response to economic conditions. Following the September 2024 rate cut, it's plausible that additional cuts will follow in subsequent meetings.\n\n- **Flexibility in Monetary Policy:** Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have emphasized the importance of data-dependent decision-making. If economic data continues to support easing, the Fed is likely to proceed with rate cuts.\n\nGiven these factors, there is a strong likelihood that the Federal Reserve will announce a rate cut before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 80%**", "probability": 80}
