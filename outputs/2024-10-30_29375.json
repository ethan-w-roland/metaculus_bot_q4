    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Florida voters approve Amendment 3, which would legalize marijuanaÂ for adults 21 years old and older?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-30\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Florida Amendment 3 is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reporting. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Florida Amendment 3, Marijuana Legalization Initiative (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Amendment_3,_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Florida voters approving Amendment 3, which aims to legalize marijuana for adults 21 years old and older, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Polling Data\nRecent polls indicate strong support for Amendment 3. A CBS News/YouGov survey in May and a Florida Atlantic University (FAU) poll in August both showed that 56% of voters supported the amendment, with the FAU poll highlighting significant support among voters between 18 and 49 years old.\nMore recent polls, such as those from Suffolk University and the University of North Florida, have also shown substantial support, with 63% and 64% of likely voters, respectively, indicating they would vote \"yes\" on the amendment.\n\n## Supermajority Requirement\nAmendment 3 must secure at least 60% of the vote to pass, a requirement that has been a hurdle for previous constitutional amendments in Florida. However, the current polling data suggests that the amendment is close to or has surpassed this threshold.\n\n## Support and Opposition\nSupporters of Amendment 3 argue that it will curb the black market, ensure safe and regulated products, free up law enforcement resources, and generate significant revenue. Notable supporters include former President Donald Trump and State Sen. Joe Gruters.\nOpponents, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Rick Scott, argue that legalization could increase unregulated drug use, make roads less safe, and negatively impact youth. Despite this opposition, the governor's stance does not seem to be uniformly supported by his party.\n\n## Historical Context\nFlorida has a history of approving medical marijuana but has not yet legalized recreational use. The 2016 medical marijuana initiative passed with 71.32% of the vote, indicating a precedent for voter support on marijuana-related issues.\n\n## Economic and Social Implications\nIf passed, Amendment 3 is expected to generate substantial tax revenue, estimated between $195 million and $430 million per year, and could create new job opportunities. It would also allow existing medical marijuana dispensaries to sell to recreational users, with potential for new businesses to be licensed in the future.\n\nGiven these points, while it is not possible to predict the outcome with absolute certainty, the current polling data and historical voter trends suggest a strong likelihood that Florida voters will approve Amendment 3. However, the requirement for a 60% supermajority vote adds a layer of complexity that must be considered.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do recent credible polls show support for Florida Amendment 3 at or above the 60% threshold required for passage?\nANSWER: Yes, recent credible polls indicate that Florida Amendment 3, which proposes legalizing marijuana for adults 21 and older, has support at or above the 60% threshold required for passage.\n\n- The University of North Florida's Public Opinion Research Lab (PORL) poll shows 66% of respondents supporting Amendment 3, which is well above the 60% required.\n- The Florida Atlantic University (FAU) poll also reports that 60% of voters are in favor of Amendment 3, meeting the necessary threshold.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout among demographics that typically support marijuana legalization expected to be high in the 2024 Florida election?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether voter turnout among demographics that typically support marijuana legalization will be high in the 2024 Florida election.\n\nWhile the sources indicate strong support for marijuana legalization among various demographic groups, such as younger voters, Democrats, and independents, they do not provide specific data or analysis on how this support translates into voter turnout.\n\nFor example, the FAU/Mainstreet Poll and other polls show high levels of support for marijuana legalization, but they do not address the issue of voter turnout directly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous marijuana-related constitutional amendments in Florida passed with more than 60% voter approval?\nANSWER: No, previous marijuana-related constitutional amendments in Florida have not consistently passed with more than 60% voter approval.\n\n- In 2014, Amendment 2, which aimed to legalize medical marijuana, received 57.62% of the vote, which was short of the 60% supermajority required for passage.\n- However, in 2016, another medical marijuana initiative, also known as Amendment 2, was approved with 71.32% of the vote, exceeding the 60% threshold.\n\nTherefore, while one medical marijuana amendment did pass with more than 60% approval, another did not.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is funding for pro-Amendment 3 campaigns comparable to or greater than funding for opposition campaigns?\nANSWER: In the context of Florida's Amendment 3, which pertains to the legalization of recreational marijuana, the funding for the pro-Amendment 3 campaigns is significantly greater than the funding for the opposition campaigns.\n\nAs of mid-August 2024, the pro-Amendment 3 campaign, Smart and Safe Florida, had raised $71.8 million, while the two main opposition campaigns, Keep Florida Clean Inc. and the Florida Freedom Fund, had raised a combined total of $14.5 million.\n\nAdditionally, Trulieve, a major cannabis company, has contributed nearly $83 million to the Smart and Safe Florida campaign, further widening the financial gap between the pro and anti-Amendment 3 campaigns.\n\nTherefore, the funding for the pro-Amendment 3 campaigns is substantially greater than the funding for the opposition campaigns. .YES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant organized opposition campaigning against Florida Amendment 3?\nANSWER: Yes, there is significant organized opposition campaigning against Florida Amendment 3.\n\nSeveral groups and individuals are actively opposing the amendment, including:\n\n- **Floridians Against Recreational Marijuana** and **Keep Florida Clean** (also known as Vote No on 3), which are leading the campaign against the amendment.\n- **Florida Freedom Fund**, created by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, is also opposing the initiative.\n- Other opponents include various officials such as U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and several state senators and representatives, as well as organizations like the Drug Free America Foundation, Florida Chamber of Commerce, and Florida Sheriffs Association.\n\nThese groups have reported significant financial contributions and expenditures to oppose the amendment, totaling over $21 million.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major political figures or parties in Florida publicly endorsing Amendment 3?\nANSWER: Yes, there are major political figures and parties in Florida who are publicly endorsing Amendment 3, although the support is not uniform across all major political entities.\n\n- State Sen. Joe Gruters, a Republican, has publicly endorsed Amendment 3 and was instrumental in securing an endorsement from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n- The Florida Senate Democratic Caucus has formally endorsed Amendment 3.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that other significant figures and parties are opposed to the amendment. For example, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, several Republican lawmakers, and organizations such as the Florida Freedom Fund and the Florida Chamber of Commerce are actively opposing Amendment 3.\n\nAdditionally, Nikki Fried, the chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, has not publicly endorsed Amendment 3 despite her past support for legalizing recreational cannabis.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has public opinion in Florida been increasingly favorable toward marijuana legalization in recent years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, public opinion in Florida has indeed been increasingly favorable toward marijuana legalization in recent years.\n\n- Multiple polls conducted in 2024 show significant support for Amendment 3, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana. For example, a poll by Emerson College Polling/The Hill in September 2024 showed 64% support, a Public Policy Polling survey in August 2024 showed 58% support, and a Beacon Research poll in June 2024 showed 66% support.\n\n- These high levels of support are consistent across various polls conducted throughout 2024, indicating a strong and persistent favorable opinion toward marijuana legalization.\n\n- Historical context from the polls also suggests that support has been high for some time, with a University of North Florida poll in November 2023 showing 67% support.\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that public opinion in Florida has been increasingly favorable toward marijuana legalization in recent years.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the wording of Florida Amendment 3 clear and understandable to voters?\nANSWER: The clarity and understandability of the wording of Florida Amendment 3 can be assessed from various perspectives, but there are some indications that it may not be entirely clear to all voters.\n\n1. **Complexity and Specifics**: The amendment includes several specific details, such as possession limits, the role of Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers, and the distinction between state and federal law. While these details are necessary, they might make the amendment more complex for some voters to fully understand.\n\n2. **Opposition Concerns**: Opponents of the amendment, such as Jessica Spencer from the Vote No On 3 campaign, argue that the amendment is \"poorly worded\" and does not address important aspects like taxes, outdoor smoking, and funding for drug education and treatment. This suggests that some voters might find the wording inadequate or unclear in certain respects.\n\n3. **Mixed Responses from Medical Marijuana Patients**: A survey among medical marijuana patients showed varied responses regarding the impact of the amendment, indicating some uncertainty and potential confusion about how the amendment would affect their access to medical marijuana.\n\nGiven these points, while the amendment's core intent is clear (legalizing recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older), the detailed provisions and potential gaps in addressing certain issues might make the wording less clear and understandable to all voters.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any recent events or developments that might reduce voter support for Amendment 3?\nANSWER: There are several recent events and developments that could potentially reduce voter support for Amendment 3, particularly in the context of Florida:\n\n## Investigations and Legal Challenges\nIn Florida, the state's election crimes office, created by Governor DeSantis, has been investigating allegations of fraud in the petitions used to place Amendment 3 (and Amendment 4) on the ballot, despite the petitions being verified by local election officials. This investigation and the subsequent lawsuit to block the amendment even if it passes could create uncertainty and mistrust among voters.\n\n## Public Service Announcements and Misinformation\nThe state of Florida has been airing public service announcements warning of the dangers of marijuana, which is related to Amendment 3 in Florida. These ads, funded by state agencies, have been criticized for potentially spreading misinformation. Additionally, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration launched a website and advertisements that opponents argue are rife with misinformation, which could influence voter opinions negatively.\n\n## Cease and Desist Letters\nThe Florida Department of Health sent cease and desist letters to TV stations that ran advertisements supporting the abortion initiative, suggesting that these ads could be considered an 'unsanitary nuisance' and threatening potential charges. This action could limit the visibility of pro-amendment messages and sway public opinion against the amendment.\n\nThese actions and developments could contribute to a reduction in voter support for Amendment 3 by creating confusion, mistrust, and negative perceptions among voters.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there other ballot measures or elections in 2024 that could impact voter turnout or demographics affecting Amendment 3's approval?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several other ballot measures and elections in 2024 that could impact voter turnout or demographics, which in turn could affect the approval of any specific amendment, including Amendment 3.\n\n### Multiple Issues on the Ballot\n- The 2024 election features approximately 150 ballot measures across 41 states, addressing a wide range of issues such as reproductive rights, marijuana laws, voting methods, economic concerns, and immigration policies. These diverse issues are likely to attract different segments of the electorate and influence voter turnout.\n\n### Reproductive Rights\n- Reproductive rights measures, in particular, are expected to increase voter turnout, especially among those motivated by the issue of abortion rights following the Dobbs v. Jackson decision. This increased turnout could have a significant impact on various other ballot measures.\n\n### Voting and Democracy Measures\n- Several states are voting on measures related to democracy, elections, and voting processes, including changes to voting restrictions, voter identification requirements, and the process for qualifying citizen-led initiatives. These measures could affect who turns out to vote and how they vote on other issues.\n\n### Economic and Social Issues\n- Ballot measures on economic matters such as minimum wage increases, property tax caps, and marijuana legalization could also draw specific demographics to the polls. For example, voters concerned about economic equity or social issues like marijuana use may be more likely to participate in the election.\n\n### State-Specific Issues\n- In states like Arizona, issues such as immigration and abortion are particularly salient and could shape voter turnout. Arizona's ballot includes a contentious immigration policy and an abortion rights measure, both of which could mobilize different voter groups.\n\nThese various ballot measures and issues can influence voter turnout and demographics, potentially impacting the approval of any specific amendment, including Amendment 3.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are **6 days** left until the outcome is known on Election Day, November 5, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed from the current state, Florida voters would **approve Amendment 3**. Recent credible polls show support meeting or exceeding the 60% supermajority required for passage.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **1.5 days** left, I would forecast a slightly **higher probability** of approval due to reduced time for any significant changes in voter sentiment.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nWith **24 days** remaining, I would forecast a slightly **lower probability** of approval due to increased uncertainty and more time for potential events that could affect public opinion.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nRecent credible polling data indicates strong support for Amendment 3. For instance:\n\n- The **University of North Florida's** Public Opinion Research Lab poll shows **66%** support among respondents.\n- The **Florida Atlantic University (FAU)** poll reports **60%** support, meeting the supermajority threshold.\n\nHistorical trends in Florida suggest increasing favorability toward marijuana legalization. In **2016**, a medical marijuana amendment passed with **71.32%** of the vote, well above the required threshold.\n\nSupport for Amendment 3 is bolstered by substantial funding:\n\n- The pro-Amendment 3 campaign, **Smart and Safe Florida**, has raised over **$71 million**, significantly outpacing opposition funding.\n- Major endorsements from political figures like **State Sen. Joe Gruters** and former President **Donald Trump** may positively influence voter support.\n\nHowever, there are factors that could impact the amendment's approval:\n\n- The **60% supermajority requirement** is a high threshold, and even minor shifts in voter sentiment could affect the outcome.\n- Organized opposition exists, including campaigns like **Floridians Against Recreational Marijuana** and opposition from figures like **Governor Ron DeSantis**.\n- Recent events, such as state-funded public service announcements warning about marijuana dangers, could sway undecided voters.\n\nConsidering the limited time left until the election, significant changes in public opinion are less likely. The strong polling numbers and historical trends favor approval, but the supermajority requirement introduces uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 80%**",
