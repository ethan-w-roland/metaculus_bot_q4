    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill we detect an exoplanet atmosphere with >5% oxygen atmosphere before 2025?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-20\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if any exoplanet with >5% O2 atmosphere is found before January 1, 2025\n\nBACKGROUND:\nDespite [Kepler’s recent](http://www.nasa.gov/kepler) end of mission [the search](http://sci.esa.int/gaia/) [for exoplanets](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/asteria.php) [continues](https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov). While their orbits and properties vary, ranging from double our Moon’s mass to thirty times Jupiter’s, their atmospheres’ compositions are harder to detect.\n\nAs of this writing this means we have mostly data from exoplanets we detected by transition and occlusion methods, but also other kind of exoplanets. However we only found *what* is in their air, not *how much* or its ratio in the atmosphere. What we did detect of their atmospheres was often hydrogen, sodium, water vapour, carbon monoxide and dioxide, methane, and even oxygen, depending on the respective exoplanet.\n\nSadly, the presence of O2 isn’t the smoking gun for extraterrestrial life some media like to report it for. There are atmospheric and geological processes that produce detectable—[or even massive](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2014.1231)—amounts of oxygen, keeping the mere presence of O2 from being a robust biomarker. On the flip side, too much oxygen is also possible, and may prevent or hamper the development of life. \n\nSo far we lack a method that would determine the composition percentages of exoplanet atmospheres, but that doesn’t mean someone clever won’t come up with a way. And once we do, finding an atmosphere with a sizeable fraction of O2 might very well be a good indicator for extraterrestrial life.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nDetecting an exoplanet atmosphere with more than 5% oxygen before 2025 is highly uncertain and unlikely based on the current state of technology and research.\n\n### Current Capabilities\n- The detection of atmospheric gases, especially in rocky exoplanets, is a challenging task. While NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has made significant progress in characterizing the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets, such as detecting possible atmospheres around 55 Cancri e, these detections are typically of gases like carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, not oxygen[2].\n- Current and upcoming telescopes, including the James Webb Space Telescope, the Giant Magellan Telescope, and the Extremely Large Telescope, are designed to detect biosignatures, but the detection of oxygen specifically is complex. Oxygen can be produced by both biological and abiotic processes, making it necessary to consider the broader context of the planet's atmosphere[3][5].\n\n### Timeframe and Technological Limitations\n- The timeframe for detecting biosignatures, including oxygen, is expected to extend beyond 2025. For instance, the detection of atmospheric signatures of potentially habitable planets may come before 2030, but confirming these findings and determining if the planets are truly habitable or have life will require more in-depth study[3].\n\n### Ongoing Research\n- Researchers are actively working on improving the methods to detect and interpret biosignatures. However, the need for robust science to distinguish living worlds from barren ones, and the complexity of interpreting atmospheric compositions, suggest that definitive detections of oxygen-rich atmospheres are not imminent[3][5].\n\nGiven these points, while there is ongoing research and significant advancements in the field, the detection of an exoplanet atmosphere with more than 5% oxygen before 2025 is not clearly predictable as a yes or no answer at this time. The technological and scientific challenges involved make it unlikely, but not impossible, depending on unforeseen breakthroughs.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there currently active telescopes capable of detecting oxygen levels in exoplanet atmospheres?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nCurrent telescopes, particularly the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), are capable of detecting oxygen levels in exoplanet atmospheres. Researchers have developed a new technique that allows JWST to identify a unique signal produced when oxygen molecules collide, which can be detected in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, specifically at a wavelength of 6.4 micrometers[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Extremely Large Telescope currently functional and being used to analyze exoplanet atmospheres?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) is still under construction and is not yet operational. It is expected to begin operations in 2028, as mentioned in several sources[1][2][5]. Therefore, it is not currently being used to analyze exoplanet atmospheres or any other astronomical phenomena.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any exoplanets with atmospheres containing more than 5% oxygen been observed as of November 20, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 20, 2024, there is no evidence from the provided sources that any exoplanets have been observed with atmospheres containing more than 5% oxygen.\n\nThe sources discuss the detection of atmospheres on exoplanets such as 55 Cancri e, which is believed to have an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, but there is no mention of oxygen levels exceeding 5%[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any unexpected discoveries or announcements regarding oxygen-rich exoplanet atmospheres been made in the last year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there have been no recent announcements or discoveries specifically regarding oxygen-rich exoplanet atmospheres made in the last year.\n\n- The sources discuss various discoveries related to exoplanet atmospheres, such as the detection of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide, but they do not mention any new or unexpected findings about oxygen-rich atmospheres in the last year[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the James Webb Space Telescope operational and contributing to exoplanet atmosphere studies in 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is operational and actively contributing to various scientific studies, including those related to exoplanet atmospheres, as of 2024.\n\n- The JWST began its science operations in July 2022 and has been continuously operational since then[1][3][5].\n- In 2024, the JWST is engaged in Cycle 3 of its operations, which includes projects focused on studying exoplanets and their atmospheres. For example, one of the projects involves using the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to determine if the exoplanet TOI-4481b has retained its atmosphere[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any research studies published before November 2024 reported the detection of high-oxygen atmospheres on exoplanets?\nANSWER: No, the sources provided do not indicate that any research studies published before November 2024 have reported the detection of high-oxygen atmospheres on exoplanets.\n\nThe studies mentioned involve the detection of atmospheric gases on exoplanets, but they do not specify high-oxygen atmospheres. For example, the research on 55 Cancri e suggests the presence of an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, but not high oxygen levels[1][2].\n\nOther discussions about oxygen in the context of exoplanets focus on the theoretical importance of oxygen for life and technological civilizations, but they do not report any actual detections of high-oxygen atmospheres on exoplanets[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any scheduled space missions before 2025 specifically targeting oxygen detection in exoplanet atmospheres?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of any space missions scheduled before 2025 that are exclusively or primarily targeted at detecting oxygen in exoplanet atmospheres.\n\n- The Ariel mission, set to launch in 2029, will characterize the atmospheres of exoplanets, but it is not scheduled to launch before 2025[1][2][3].\n- The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is currently operational and will study various aspects of exoplanet atmospheres, but the sources do not specify oxygen detection as a primary goal for its upcoming missions before 2025[5].\n- NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is in the early planning phase and not scheduled to launch before 2025, and it is aimed at searching for atmospheric biosignatures, including potentially oxygen, but it is not yet operational[3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any exoplanets with known potentially habitable conditions been identified as having oxygen-rich atmospheres by 2024?\nANSWER: As of 2024, there is no definitive identification of an exoplanet with a known oxygen-rich atmosphere under potentially habitable conditions.\n\n- The exoplanet 55 Cancri e, while detected to have an atmosphere, is too hot to be habitable and its atmosphere is likely rich in carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide, not oxygen[2][3].\n- For LHS 1140 b, there is a tentative suggestion of a nitrogen-rich atmosphere, but not specifically an oxygen-rich one. Further observations are needed to confirm the atmospheric composition[4].\n- The TRAPPIST-1 system, particularly TRAPPIST-1 c, has been studied, but the current data does not confirm an oxygen-rich atmosphere. While there is a possibility of fairly thick oxygen atmospheres being consistent with some interpretations, this is not yet confirmed and the primary findings still suggest either a bare rock surface or a thin atmosphere[5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as there is no conclusive evidence of an oxygen-rich atmosphere on a potentially habitable exoplanet by 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there sufficient funding allocated to exoplanet atmosphere research to support high-oxygen detection projects before 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is significant funding and support allocated to exoplanet atmosphere research, which can potentially support high-oxygen detection projects before 2025.\n\n1. **Ariel Data Challenge 2024**: This initiative, supported by various space agencies and institutions, includes a substantial prize pool and is focused on extracting faint exoplanetary signals, which is relevant to atmosphere research[1].\n\n2. **iLocater Project**: Funded by the National Science Foundation and NASA, this project aims to develop an instrument for detecting exoplanets and characterizing their atmospheres. The funding totals $4.3 million and will be used over the next three years, which includes the period before 2025[2].\n\n3. **Exoplanets Research (ROSES 2024)**: This NASA program solicits proposals for basic research to improve our understanding of exoplanets, including their atmospheres. The program has specific deadlines in 2024, indicating ongoing funding and support for such research[3].\n\n4. **U.S. Contributions to Ariel Preparatory Science (US-CAPS)**: This program element under ROSES 2024 is specifically aimed at supporting the Ariel mission, which focuses on characterizing exoplanet atmospheres. Proposals are due in February 2025, but the preparatory science activities are ongoing and will continue into 2025[5].\n\nGiven these sources, it is clear that there is sufficient funding allocated to support research on exoplanet atmospheres, including projects that could involve high-oxygen detection, before 2025.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any technological breakthroughs in atmospheric composition detection methods since 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several technological advancements and breakthroughs in atmospheric composition detection methods since 2023.\n\n1. **Ytterbium Thin-Disk Lasers**: Scientists have developed advanced laser technology, specifically ytterbium thin-disk lasers, to detect and monitor atmospheric pollutants like methane and other climate pollutants with high precision[2].\n\n2. **AEROMMA 2023 Experiment**: This multi-agency, multi-platform experiment involves the use of airborne, surface, and satellite observing systems, along with state-of-the-art air quality and climate models. It aims to improve the representation of emissions and chemical and physical processes in weather-chemistry models and to quantify various trace gas sources in urban areas[4].\n\n3. **TEMPO Satellite**: The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution (TEMPO) instrument, launched as part of NASA’s Earth System Explorer Program, is the first space-based instrument to monitor air pollutants at hourly time resolution across North America. This enhances the capability for remote sensing of atmospheric composition[4].\n\n4. **Sentinel-5P Tropospheric Ozone Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)**: Although launched before 2023, ongoing improvements and enhanced spatial resolution of its satellite products continue to make it a valuable tool for evaluating and constraining emission inventories and monitoring atmospheric pollutants[4].\n\n5. **Atmosphere-Centred Research Infrastructures (ATMO-RIs)**: The combination of open-access and interoperable observational data from infrastructures like ACTRIS, IAGOS, and ICOS continues to offer novel research opportunities in atmospheric sciences, including improved data collection and provision through standardized methods and rich metadata[3].\n\nThese advancements indicate significant technological progress in detecting and monitoring atmospheric composition since 2023.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- **Approximately 40 days** remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- **No detection** of an exoplanet atmosphere with >5% oxygen would occur before 2025, maintaining the current status quo where such detections have not been made.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- With only **10 days** remaining, the likelihood of achieving a significant breakthrough in detecting a >5% oxygen atmosphere is **extremely low**, estimated at **1%**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- With **160 days** remaining, while still a constrained timeframe, there is a **slight increase** in the probability due to ongoing observations and data analysis. The estimated probability in this scenario rises to **10%**.\n\n**Rationale:**\nGiven the current date of November 20, 2024, there are approximately two months left until the resolution date. The detection of exoplanetary atmospheres with significant oxygen concentrations (>5%) relies heavily on advanced instrumentation, data analysis, and often serendipitous discoveries. While the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is operational and contributes valuable data, the specific detection of high-oxygen atmospheres remains challenging due to technological limitations and the complexity of distinguishing biological oxygen from abiotic sources.\n\nThe background information indicates that, as of now, no exoplanets with >5% oxygen atmospheres have been confirmed. Additionally, no major technological breakthroughs between 2023 and 2024 have drastically altered the landscape to make such detections more imminent within this short timeframe. The absence of newly operational telescopes like the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) further limits the immediate potential for such discoveries.\n\nConsidering the constrained window until early January 2025, the probability of a significant detection remains low. Even with a quadrupled timeframe, the advancements and detections would still require concerted efforts and perhaps more time than available.\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
