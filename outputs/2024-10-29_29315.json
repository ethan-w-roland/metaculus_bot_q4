    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Donald Trump outperform Rick Scott in Florida in the 2024 election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald Trump receives more votes in the 2024 presidential race in the state of Florida than Rick Scott receives in the Senatorial race in that state. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Senate Republican candidates are trailing Donald Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/15/senate-election-trump-republicans/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Donald Trump will outperform Rick Scott in Florida in the 2024 election, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Polling Data\n- Recent polls indicate that both Donald Trump and Rick Scott are leading their Democratic opponents in Florida. However, the margins differ slightly. Trump is leading Kamala Harris by a 5- to 6-point margin in various polls, while Rick Scott is leading Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by a 5- to 7-point margin.\n\n## Voter Demographics\n- Trump and Scott both enjoy strong support among key demographics such as Hispanics and Non-Party Affiliated (NPA) voters. Trump holds a 55% to 44% lead among Hispanics and a 52% to 42% lead among NPAs, while Scott has a 56% to 39% lead among Hispanics and a 50% to 44% lead among NPAs.\n\n## Statewide Trends\n- Florida has trended more conservative in recent years, with Republicans making significant gains in voter registration. As of October 2024, Republicans have a lead of over 1 million registered voters compared to Democrats.\n\n## Economic and Social Issues\n- Economic issues such as inflation and property insurance costs are top of mind for Florida voters, and Republicans are perceived to perform better on these issues. This could influence voter preferences and potentially benefit both Trump and Scott.\n\nGiven these points, while both Trump and Scott are leading in their respective races, the question of whether Trump will outperform Scott specifically is not clearly answerable with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" based on the available data. However, the polling margins suggest that both candidates are in strong positions, with Trump's lead over Harris slightly more consistent across different polls than Scott's lead over Mucarsel-Powell.\n\nTo make a more informed prediction, a superforecaster would need to consider the ongoing trends, any late-breaking developments, and the historical context of Florida's electoral behavior. The current data indicates that both Trump and Scott are favored to win, but the relative performance between them is not definitively clear.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are both Donald Trump and Rick Scott the Republican nominees in their respective races in Florida for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Yes, both Donald Trump and Rick Scott are the Republican nominees in their respective races in Florida for the 2024 election.\n\n- Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for the presidential election, as indicated by his lead in the polls and his status as the Republican candidate.\n- Rick Scott won the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in Florida, making him the Republican nominee for that seat.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Democratic candidate for the Florida Senate seat polling close to Rick Scott in voter support?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that the Democratic candidate, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, is indeed polling close to the incumbent Republican, Rick Scott, in the Florida Senate race.\n\n- A memo from the Debbie Mucarsel-Powell campaign notes that recent public and private polls show the race to be a \"margin of error race,\" indicating that the contest is very close.\n- The memo also mentions that Mucarsel-Powell is leading among independent voters and that her campaign has been effective in reaching key demographics, further suggesting a competitive race.\n- Another source mentions that a poll conducted by the University of North Florida's Public Opinion Research Lab in late July showed the race to be close, although specific numbers are not provided.\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is polling close to Rick Scott in voter support.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Rick Scott facing a stronger Democratic opponent than Donald Trump is in Florida?\nANSWER: Based on the polling data and the context provided in the sources, it appears that Rick Scott is facing a more competitive race compared to Donald Trump in Florida.\n\nFor Rick Scott, the polls indicate a very close race with his Democratic opponent, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. For example, an Emerson College Polling survey showed Scott leading Mucarsel-Powell by just 1 point (46% to 45%), and another poll by the Florida Chamber found Scott leading by 5 points (51% to 46%).\n\nIn contrast, the polling data for Donald Trump in Florida shows him leading his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, by a more significant margin. The Florida Chamber poll indicated Trump leading Harris by 6 points (51% to 45%).\n\nGiven these details, it suggests that Rick Scott is indeed facing a stronger Democratic opponent in terms of the closeness of the race.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently polling ahead of Rick Scott in Florida in terms of voter support?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the question of whether Donald Trump is currently polling ahead of Rick Scott in Florida in terms of voter support cannot be directly answered because the sources compare each candidate's support against their respective Democratic opponents, not against each other.\n\n- Donald Trump is leading Kamala Harris in the presidential race by various margins according to different polls.\n- Rick Scott is leading Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in the US Senate race by various margins according to different polls.\n\nThere is no direct comparison between Trump's and Scott's levels of voter support in these sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout typically higher for presidential elections than for Senate elections in Florida?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is generally observed that voter turnout is typically higher for presidential elections compared to other types of elections, including Senate elections. Here are some points that support this:\n\n- The 2024 presidential election in Florida has already seen over 4.5 million people voting, which is a significant number indicating high interest and participation in the presidential election.\n- Historical trends and general election data often show that presidential elections draw more voters than midterm or other types of elections, including Senate races. This is because presidential elections tend to garner more national attention and public engagement.\n\nWhile the sources do not provide a direct comparison of voter turnout between presidential and Senate elections in Florida, the context suggests that presidential elections generally have higher turnout.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump historically received more votes in Florida than Rick Scott in previous elections?\nANSWER: To determine if Donald Trump has historically received more votes in Florida than Rick Scott in previous elections, we need to examine the voting records of both individuals in their respective elections.\n\n- **Donald Trump**: In the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, Donald Trump received significant support in Florida. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, Trump won Florida with 4,617,886 votes, and in the 2020 presidential election, he received 5,668,731 votes in the state.\n\n- **Rick Scott**: Rick Scott has run in several elections in Florida, including his gubernatorial campaigns and his Senate campaign. In his 2010 gubernatorial election, Scott received 1,607,291 votes, and in his 2014 re-election, he received 2,865,343 votes. In his 2018 Senate campaign, Scott received 4,099,505 votes.\n\nGiven these numbers, Donald Trump has received more votes in Florida in his presidential elections compared to Rick Scott's votes in his gubernatorial and Senate elections.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant third-party candidates in the Florida Senate race that could affect Rick Scott's vote total?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, while there are third-party and unaffiliated candidates in the Florida Senate race, it is unclear whether they will have a significant impact on Rick Scott's vote total.\n\nThe candidates mentioned include:\n- Feena Bonoan (Libertarian Party)\n- Ben Everidge (Unaffiliated)\n- Tuan \"TQ\" Nguyen (Unaffiliated).\n\nHowever, the sources do not provide specific polling data or indications of how much support these candidates are likely to garner, which would be necessary to determine if they could significantly affect Rick Scott's vote total.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump more popular than Rick Scott among key demographics in Florida, such as Hispanics and Non-Party Affiliated voters?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is a comparison of the popularity of Donald Trump and Rick Scott among key demographics in Florida:\n\n## Among Hispanics:\n- Donald Trump holds a significant lead among Hispanic voters, with 55% support in the presidential race and 58% support in another poll.\n- Rick Scott also has strong support among Hispanic voters, with 56% supporting his re-election bid and 66% in a different context.\n\n## Among Non-Party Affiliated (NPA) Voters:\n- Donald Trump leads among NPA voters with 52% support in the presidential race.\n- Rick Scott also enjoys support from NPA voters, with 50% supporting his re-election bid.\n\nWhile both Trump and Scott have strong support among these demographics, the data does not consistently show that one is significantly more popular than the other across all polls. However, in some specific polls, Trump's support among Hispanics and NPAs is slightly higher or comparable to Scott's.\n\nGiven the close and sometimes varying margins, it is not clear that Donald Trump is unequivocally more popular than Rick Scott among these key demographics.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Rick Scott been involved in any controversies that could negatively impact his vote count in Florida?\nANSWER: Yes, Rick Scott has been involved in several controversies that could negatively impact his vote count in Florida.\n\n1. **Voting Rights Controversies**: During his tenure as Governor, Scott implemented and supported various measures that restricted voting rights, such as reducing early voting days, eliminating early voting on the Sunday before Election Day, and imposing barriers to voter registration. These actions were criticized by county election supervisors, the League of Women Voters, and federal judges, and were seen as attempts to suppress Democratic votes.\n\n2. **Abortion Policies**: Scott has taken stances on abortion that have been controversial, including supporting state-level abortion bans and opposing federal legislation to protect abortion rights. His positions have been criticized by Democrats and advocates for women's rights, who see his views as draconian and harmful.\n\n3. **Healthcare and Social Security**: Scott's \"Plan to Rescue America\" included proposals to sunset federal legislation, including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, every five years, which was widely criticized as dangerous and irresponsible. Additionally, his role in the Medicare and Medicaid fraud scandal at Columbia/HCA has been highlighted as a significant ethical concern.\n\n4. **Education**: Scott's proposal to shut down the federal Department of Education and leave education as a state function has raised concerns about the lack of national education standards and the potential for inconsistent educational quality across states.\n\n5. **Insurance Crisis**: Scott's policies as governor, such as attracting subpar insurance firms and increasing premiums for the state-backed insurer, have been linked to the current home insurance crisis in Florida. This issue is particularly relevant given the recent hurricanes and the financial challenges faced by homeowners.\n\nThese controversies have generated significant criticism and could potentially negatively impact his vote count in Florida.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has recent polling shown Rick Scott's lead over his opponent decreasing in Florida?\nANSWER: To determine if recent polling has shown Rick Scott's lead over his opponent decreasing in Florida, we need to compare the results from different polls over time.\n\n1. **Earlier Poll**: A poll from September 30, 2024, mentioned that Rick Scott had a narrow lead, but the exact margin was not specified in the source provided.\n\n2. **Recent Poll**: A more recent poll from the Florida Chamber, released on October 24, 2024, shows that Rick Scott leads his Democratic opponent, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, by a five-point margin (51% to 46%).\n\n3. **Another Recent Poll**: Another source from October 21, 2024, indicates that the Florida Senate race is \"tightly contested,\" suggesting a close race, but it does not provide specific numbers to compare the margin of Scott's lead.\n\nGiven the information available, the October 24 poll shows a five-point lead for Rick Scott, which is not directly compared to earlier specific margins in the sources provided. However, the description of the race as \"tightly contested\" in the October 21 poll suggests that the race may be closer than previously indicated, but without exact numbers, it is unclear if this represents a decrease in Scott's lead.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is **UNCLEAR** whether Rick Scott's lead has specifically decreased, as the sources do not provide a direct comparison of the margins over time.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately **7 days** remain until the 2024 elections on November 5, 2024.\n\n(b) **If nothing changed, the outcome would be:** **Yes**—Donald Trump would receive more votes in Florida than Rick Scott.\n\n(c) **If there was only a quarter of the time left (about 2 days), I would forecast:** A slightly higher probability that Trump will outperform Scott, due to reduced time for any significant changes.\n\n(d) **If there was 4 times the time left (about 28 days), I would forecast:** A lower probability that Trump will outperform Scott, as more time allows for potential shifts in voter sentiment.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Turnout Patterns:** Presidential elections consistently attract higher voter turnout than Senate races. In Florida's 2020 presidential election, approximately 11 million votes were cast, whereas the 2018 Senate race saw about 8 million votes. Higher turnout in presidential elections increases the likelihood that Donald Trump will receive more overall votes than Rick Scott.\n\n- **Previous Election Results:** In the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump received about 5.67 million votes in Florida. In contrast, Rick Scott received approximately 4.1 million votes in his 2018 Senate race. This historical precedent suggests that Trump is likely to garner more votes than Scott.\n\n- **Current Polling Data:**\n  - **Donald Trump:** Leading Kamala Harris by margins ranging from 5 to 6 points.\n  - **Rick Scott:** Leading Debbie Mucarsel-Powell by margins ranging from 1 to 5 points, indicating a tighter race.\n  - The narrower lead for Scott suggests his vote total may be closer to that of his opponent compared to Trump's margin over his opponent.\n\n- **Voter Demographics:**\n  - Both candidates have strong support among Hispanics and Non-Party Affiliated voters.\n  - Trump's broader national profile may boost turnout among his supporters more than Scott's campaign.\n\n- **Strength of Opposition:**\n  - **Rick Scott's Opponent:** Debbie Mucarsel-Powell appears to be a strong candidate, polling closely with Scott and potentially benefiting from any negative sentiments toward Scott.\n  - **Donald Trump's Opponent:** Kamala Harris is trailing by a slightly larger margin, and Trump's base remains solid in Florida.\n\n- **Controversies Surrounding Rick Scott:**\n  - Involvement in voting rights restrictions, healthcare controversies, and the state's insurance crisis could negatively impact his support.\n  - These issues may not affect Trump to the same extent, potentially widening the gap in their respective vote totals.\n\n- **Potential Impact of Third-Party Candidates:**\n  - Third-party candidates in the Senate race might siphon votes from Scott, although the extent is unclear.\n  - Less significant third-party presence in the presidential race may favor Trump’s total vote count.\n\n- **Time Remaining Before the Election:**\n  - With only a week left, major shifts are less likely, solidifying current trends.\n  - If more time were available, there would be greater uncertainty due to potential campaign developments or external events.\n\n**Probability: 75%**",
