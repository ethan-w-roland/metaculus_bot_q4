    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the temperature in Anchorage, Alaska ever go below 0 degrees F in the entire month of December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-26\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the low temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is ever below 0 degrees for the Anchorage, Alaska weather station, as reported [here](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/hist.phtml?station=PANC&network=AK_ASOS). If the low for any day has not been below that, then this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nMissing data for any of the observed values (coded by the NWS as \"MM\") will not be considered. No other resolution source other than the Data Calendar posted at Iowa State University will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn most years there are multiple days below 0 in Anchorage in December. However, in December 2019, there were not any. According to [Iowa State University](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/), \"The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) collects environmental data from cooperating members with observing networks. The data are stored and made available on this website.\" \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the weather forecasts and historical data for Anchorage, Alaska in December, it is highly likely that the temperature will go below 0 degrees F (−17.8°C) multiple times throughout the month.\n\nHere are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The average temperature in Anchorage at the beginning of December is around -3.6°F (-19.8°C), and it tends to cool down further as the month progresses, reaching an average of -9.4°F (-23°C) by the end of December[1].\n- Daily temperature forecasts for December 2024 show temperatures consistently below 0°F, with many days having daytime highs and nighttime lows well below this mark[1][5].\n- Specific daily forecasts indicate temperatures such as -6°F to -15°F (-21.1°C to -26.1°C) on several days, which is significantly below 0°F[1][5].\n\nGiven these forecasts and the typical climate in Anchorage during December, it is clear that the temperature will indeed go below 0 degrees F multiple times throughout the month. Therefore, the answer to the question is **yes**.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Iowa Environmental Mesonet currently reporting reliable data for Anchorage's December temperatures?\nANSWER: The Iowa Environmental Mesonet does not report data for Anchorage's temperatures. The mesonet primarily collects and provides environmental data from cooperating members with observing networks, which are mainly located in Iowa and other parts of the contiguous United States, not in Alaska[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any known data gaps (\"MM\") in Anchorage's December 2024 temperature records?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information available regarding the temperature records for December 2024 in Anchorage. The sources either discuss events and data from 2022 and 2023 or provide general climate information, but they do not include data for December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has December 2024 been warmer than average so far in Anchorage, Alaska?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the information about December 2024 specifically is not detailed, but we can infer some insights from the general weather patterns described.\n\n- From the source discussing the winter of 2024 in Alaska, it is mentioned that despite the cold snaps, Alaska is still slightly warmer than normal for the month of January and was half a degree warmer in December 2023 compared to the 1991-2020 normal periods[1].\n- However, for December 2024, the specific temperature averages are not provided in the sources.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data for December 2024, we cannot definitively say whether December 2024 has been warmer than average in Anchorage.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Anchorage, Alaska experienced temperatures below 0 degrees F in previous Decembers?\nANSWER: Yes, Anchorage, Alaska has experienced temperatures below 0 degrees F in previous Decembers.\n\n- Historical data shows that Anchorage often experiences freezing temperatures in December. On average, the thermometer dips to 0 °F (-18 °C) or below on about 5 nights during the month[2].\n- The lowest temperature records for December in Anchorage include several instances below 0 °F. For example, in 2012, the lowest temperature was -15 °F (-26 °C), and in other years, temperatures have dropped even lower, such as -28 °F (-33 °C) in 1999[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent warming trend in Anchorage, Alaska that might prevent temperatures from dropping below 0 degrees F in December 2024?\nANSWER: While there is a long-term warming trend in Alaska, including Anchorage, the specific impact on temperatures dropping below 0 degrees F in December 2024 is not clearly determined by the provided sources.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- Alaska, including Anchorage, has experienced a significant warming trend over the past several decades, with statewide mean annual temperatures increasing by around 4.3°F over the last seven decades[3].\n- The warming trend is particularly pronounced in winter, with some regions seeing significant increases in winter temperatures[3].\n- However, the sources do not provide specific predictions for December 2024 temperatures or whether they will drop below 0 degrees F. They discuss general trends and recent weather patterns but do not offer a forecast for a specific month[1][2][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average low temperature in Anchorage, Alaska during December below 0 degrees F?\nANSWER: Yes, the average low temperature in Anchorage, Alaska during December is below 0 degrees F.\n\n- According to the source from Current Results, the average low temperature in December is 14 °F (-10 °C), which is above 0 °F but still well below freezing[1].\n- The source from Wanderlog also indicates that the average low temperature in December is 16 °F (-9 °C), again below 0 °C but above 0 °F[2].\n- Weatherspark mentions that daily low temperatures decrease from 15 °F to 13 °F, which are both below 0 °C but above 0 °F[4].\n\nAll sources confirm that the average low temperature in December is below 0 °C (32 °F) but above 0 °F.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do current weather forecasts for December 2024 predict any days with temperatures below 0 degrees F in Anchorage?\nANSWER: Yes, the current weather forecasts for December 2024 in Anchorage do predict days with temperatures below 0 degrees F.\n\n- According to the forecast on easeweather.com, temperatures in Anchorage are expected to be significantly cold, with average temperatures ranging from -6.3°F at the beginning of the month to -9.4°F by the end of December[1].\n- The forecast on world-weather.info also indicates temperatures well below 0°F, with daily minimum temperatures often in the negative range throughout December[2].\n- Meteoprog.com's forecast shows daily minimum temperatures consistently below 0°F for the entire month of December[4].\n- The Almanac's 60-Day Extended Weather Forecast also mentions very cold conditions and temperatures below 0°F for various periods in December[5].\n\nAll these sources confirm that temperatures below 0 degrees F are expected in Anchorage during December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant weather patterns expected in December 2024 that typically cause low temperatures in Anchorage?\nANSWER: Yes, there are significant weather patterns expected in December 2024 that typically cause low temperatures in Anchorage.\n\nHere are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The average temperature in Anchorage during December is expected to be quite cold, with temperatures ranging from -6°F to -15°F on some days[1][4][5].\n- The month is predicted to start with temperatures around -6.3°F, which is cooler than the historical average, and temperatures are expected to drop further as the month progresses, reaching an average of -9.4°F by the end of December[1].\n- There are forecasts of snowstorms, flurries, and very cold conditions throughout the month, particularly in the periods from December 1-4, 9-11, and 24-27[5].\n- The climate is described as \"very cold\" and \"icy\" with significant snowfall, averaging 17 snowy days and a total snowfall of 82.8 cm[1][3].\n\nThese conditions indicate that December 2024 will indeed be characterized by low temperatures in Anchorage.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have similar forecasts in the past for Anchorage in December been accurate in predicting below 0 degrees F temperatures?\nANSWER: To determine the accuracy of past forecasts for below 0 degrees F temperatures in Anchorage during December, we need to consider historical climate data and the reliability of weather forecasting models.\n\n### Historical Climate Data\n- Anchorage typically experiences very cold temperatures in December, with average temperatures often below 0 degrees F. For example, the average temperature at the beginning of December is around -3.6°F, and it drops to around -9.4°F by the end of the month[1][2][3].\n\n### Forecast Accuracy\n- While the sources provided do not specifically address the historical accuracy of temperature forecasts, they do indicate that December temperatures in Anchorage are consistently cold and often below 0 degrees F. This suggests that forecasts predicting such temperatures are generally aligned with historical climate patterns.\n\n### General Reliability\n- Weather forecasting models, especially those using long-term climate data from reputable sources like the University of East Anglia, the Met Office, and the Netherlands Meteorological Institute, tend to be reliable for predicting broad temperature trends over a month[2].\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that forecasts predicting below 0 degrees F temperatures in Anchorage during December have been generally accurate, as they align with the well-documented cold climate of the region during this time.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any expected anomalies in December 2024 weather that could affect Anchorage's temperatures?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several indications of weather patterns that could affect temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska, in December 2024:\n\n1. **Temperature Anomalies**: The forecasts suggest that Alaska, including the northern and western parts, is expected to experience normal to below-normal temperatures. For example, the source from the National Weather Service indicates that northern and western Alaska can expect wetter-than-average conditions but also mentions colder-than-average conditions in some regions[3][4].\n\n2. **Pressure and Geopotential Height Anomalies**: The Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the positioning of high and low-pressure systems are expected to influence the weather. Troughing and negative geopotential height anomalies across much of Canada and the Eastern US could extend to Alaska, favoring normal to below-normal temperatures[2].\n\n3. **Specific Regional Forecasts**: The NOAA winter outlook specifies that Alaska, particularly northern and western Alaska, is expected to see wetter-than-average conditions, but it also hints at colder temperatures in some areas. Southeast Alaska is specifically mentioned as having below-average precipitation and potentially below-normal temperatures[3][4][5].\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that there are expected anomalies in December 2024 weather that could affect Anchorage's temperatures, particularly leaning towards colder and potentially wetter conditions.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 5 days until December 1, 2024, after which the temperature readings for December will begin. The outcome will be known by the end of December 2024 or earlier if a day below 0°F is recorded.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf historical patterns and current forecasts remain consistent, the temperature in Anchorage, Alaska, will go below 0 degrees F multiple times during December 2024. Therefore, the outcome would be **Yes**.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about 7-8 days left until December 1, and given the strong historical precedent and current weather forecasts indicating temperatures below 0°F, the probability would still be extremely high, around **99%**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nEven if there were four times the amount of time left (which would extend the forecast period well beyond December 2024), the probability remains virtually unchanged due to the consistent historical data and reliable weather forecasts. The probability would still be **99%**.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAnchorage, Alaska, is known for its cold December temperatures, with historical data showing that temperatures frequently drop below 0 degrees F multiple times each December. The only notable exception was December 2019. Current weather forecasts for December 2024 predict consistently low temperatures, with daily forecasts indicating temperatures well below 0°F on numerous days. Additionally, the average low temperatures for December are significantly below freezing, further supporting the likelihood of temperatures dropping below 0°F. Given the strong alignment between historical patterns and current forecasts, the probability that the temperature in Anchorage, Alaska, will go below 0 degrees F at least once during December 2024 is exceedingly high.\n\n**Probability: 99%**",
