    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill South Carolina have 300,000 or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-20\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/south-carolina) lists greater than or equal to 300,000 South Carolina residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after December 31, 2024. If the number is below 300,000, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Nearly four weeks without rain, drought conditions creeping back in South Carolina](https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/10/24/nearly-four-weeks-without-rain-drought-conditions-creeping-back-south-carolina/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought conditions by December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Population and Demographic Data\n- The population projections and demographic data provided by the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office (RFA) focus on population growth, age groups, and county-level population changes, but they do not address environmental conditions such as droughts[1][2][3].\n\n## Drought Conditions\n- Drought conditions are influenced by climate, weather patterns, and other environmental factors, which are not directly addressed in the population and demographic data.\n\n## Current State of Droughts\n- As of the current date, there is no specific data provided in the sources regarding the number of residents living in drought conditions. Drought conditions can vary significantly over short periods due to weather events and other factors.\n\n## Predictive Challenges\n- Predicting the exact number of residents affected by droughts is challenging due to the dynamic nature of weather and climate conditions. Droughts can develop or alleviate rapidly based on rainfall, temperature, and other environmental factors.\n\nGiven the information available, it is not possible to clearly answer whether South Carolina will have 300,000 or more residents living in drought conditions by December 31, 2024, as this would require real-time climate and weather data that are not provided in the sources.\n\n### Relevant Considerations for Superforecasters\n- **Base Rates**: Historical data on droughts in South Carolina could provide some context, but it would not be definitive for predicting the exact number of residents affected by droughts in 2024.\n- **Time to Resolution**: Drought conditions can change rapidly, so any prediction would need to be updated frequently to reflect current weather patterns.\n- **Current State of the World**: Real-time climate and weather reports would be essential for making an accurate prediction.\n- **Reference Classes**: Comparing current weather patterns to historical droughts in South Carolina might offer some insights but would not provide a precise answer without additional data.\n\nIn summary, while the sources provide detailed demographic and population data, they do not include the necessary information to predict the number of residents affected by drought conditions.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the population of South Carolina 5 million or more as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the population of South Carolina is 5 million or more as of November 2024. According to the sources, as of 2023, the population of South Carolina was approximately 5.37 million people[3][5], and given the ongoing growth trend, it is reasonable to conclude that the population would still be above 5 million in November 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is South Carolina currently experiencing drought conditions according to the US Drought Monitor?\nANSWER: Yes, South Carolina is currently experiencing drought conditions, although the severity and extent vary. As of November 12, 2024:\n\n- Approximately 10% of South Carolina is under drought conditions[5].\n- Moderate drought conditions are present in several areas, including coastal regions and parts of the state[1][5].\n- Abnormally dry conditions cover about 60% of the state[5].\n\nThese conditions are confirmed by the U.S. Drought Monitor reports[1][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the projected trend for rainfall in South Carolina for December 2024 below the historical average?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the projected trend for rainfall in South Carolina for December 2024 is not below the historical average. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- One source indicates that significant rainfall exceeding 182.9 mm is expected in South Carolina during December, which is higher than the average[2].\n- Another source mentions that the precipitation in December is expected to be around 81 mm (3.17 in), but it also notes that this is not below the average and actually suggests it might be more than in November[5].\n\nTherefore, the projected rainfall for December 2024 is not below the historical average.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are South Carolina's major water reservoirs below 50% of their capacity as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is not enough specific data to determine the exact capacity levels of South Carolina's major water reservoirs as of November 2024.\n\n- The sources from the USGS provide current conditions and historical data for specific reservoirs like Lake Greenwood and Parr Shoals Reservoir, but they do not include the current capacity levels or percentages[2][3].\n- The Broad River Basin Plan discusses water use and projections but does not provide real-time data on reservoir capacities[1].\n- The South Carolina Emergency Management news releases mention flooding and storm responses but do not include information on the current capacity of water reservoirs[5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been no major rainfall events in South Carolina since September 2024?\nANSWER: NO, there have been major rainfall events in South Carolina since September 2024. Here are some key points:\n\n- Hurricane Helene made landfall on September 26, 2024, and brought significant rainfall, flooding, and other destructive effects to South Carolina. The storm caused extensive damage, including flooding and downed powerlines, across various parts of the state[5].\n- Prior to Helene, another significant rainfall event occurred on September 16, 2024, associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight, which resulted in historic rainfall and flash flooding in the Cape Fear Region of southeastern North Carolina and parts of South Carolina, with totals of 12 to 20 inches of rain in a short period[3].\n\nThese events indicate that there have indeed been major rainfall events in South Carolina since September 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant heatwaves in South Carolina during the current drought period?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been significant heatwaves in South Carolina during the current drought period. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The drought update for the Southeast as of November 1, 2024, mentions that \"above-normal temperatures, including near-record average high temperatures in some areas, have contributed to the drying out of soils\"[1].\n- The July 15, 2024, update also notes \"excessive heat, extreme dryness and sporadic rain\" led to a rapid intensification and expansion of drought conditions across the Southeast, including South Carolina[3].\n- Additionally, the summer 2024 climate outlook highlights an increased likelihood of above-normal temperatures across the Carolinas, which has contributed to the heat stress and drought conditions[5].\n\nThese sources indicate that the region, including South Carolina, has experienced significant heatwaves that have exacerbated the drought conditions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been fewer than average rainfall levels in South Carolina in the past three months compared to historical averages?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- For October 2024, it is clear that South Carolina, particularly the Columbia area, experienced significantly below-average rainfall. The region had 23 consecutive days without measurable rainfall, and the overall precipitation was well below the average for October[2].\n- While the sources do not provide detailed monthly precipitation data for September and November specifically for South Carolina, the October data indicates a significant deviation from the average.\n- However, to conclusively determine if the past three months (September, October, and November) had fewer than average rainfall levels, we would need more comprehensive data for September and November. The provided sources do not offer this detailed information for these months.\n\nGiven the information available, we can confirm that October was exceptionally dry, but we cannot definitively state the rainfall levels for the entire three-month period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are at least five counties in South Carolina designated as experiencing severe or extreme drought as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication that at least five counties in South Carolina are designated as experiencing severe or extreme drought as of November 2024.\n\n- The USDA designation mentioned in [2] does include areas experiencing severe (D2) and extreme (D3) drought, but it does not specify the number of counties currently in those conditions.\n- The U.S. Drought Monitor data as of November 1, 2024, mentioned in [1], indicates some areas of Severe Drought (D2) and one spot of Extreme Drought (D3) in Tennessee, but it does not provide a detailed count for South Carolina.\n- The current drought conditions for South Carolina as of November 12, 2024, in [5], show that while there are areas under Moderate Drought and Abnormally Dry conditions, it does not specify any counties under Severe or Extreme Drought.\n\nTherefore, the information available is not sufficient to confirm that at least five counties in South Carolina are experiencing severe or extreme drought.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there ongoing government water conservation initiatives in South Carolina to address drought conditions?\nANSWER: Yes, there are ongoing government water conservation initiatives in South Carolina aimed at managing and conserving water resources, which can help address drought conditions among other water management issues.\n\n- Executive Order No. 2024-22 established the WaterSC Water Resources Working Group, which is tasked with developing a state water plan that balances economic, environmental, and social needs. This group will work on ensuring the reliability, resiliency, sustainability, and sufficiency of the state’s water resources, including addressing surface and groundwater management[1][3][4].\n\n- The working group is required to create a Stakeholder Engagement Plan, provide a report to the Surface Water Study Committee, and advise the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SCDES) on comprehensive water resources policy. These initiatives are designed to ensure sustainable water practices and manage water resources effectively, which is crucial during drought conditions[1][3][4].\n\nWhile the sources do not specifically mention \"drought conditions,\" the comprehensive nature of these initiatives suggests they are designed to manage water resources in a way that would help mitigate the effects of droughts.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is agricultural water usage restricted in South Carolina due to drought conditions as of November 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 2024, there are indications that agricultural water usage is subject to certain restrictions and considerations due to drought conditions in South Carolina, although the restrictions may not be universally applied to all agricultural users.\n\n1. **Drought Conditions**: The region, including South Carolina, has been experiencing severe drought conditions, with extreme drought (D3) classifications in some areas. This has led to low streamflow rates, historic low levels in groundwater, and significant impacts on crops and water systems[4].\n\n2. **Water Restrictions**: While the City of Walhalla has implemented temporary outdoor water use restrictions to ensure adequate household water supply, these restrictions specifically exempt agricultural operations. However, this does not mean that agricultural water use is entirely unrestricted; it suggests that local authorities may impose restrictions based on specific conditions[3].\n\n3. **State Regulations and Planning**: The state has robust regulations and ongoing efforts to manage water resources, including the establishment of the WaterSC Water Resources Working Group to develop a state water plan. This plan aims to balance economic, environmental, and social needs, which could include managing water use during droughts[2].\n\nGiven these points, while there are no blanket restrictions on all agricultural water usage, there are localized restrictions and a general emphasis on water conservation and management due to the drought conditions.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n\nThere are 41 days left until December 31, 2024.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n\nIf current conditions remain unchanged, approximately 10% of South Carolina's population, equating to around 500,000 residents, are already living in drought conditions. This exceeds the 300,000-resident threshold, resulting in a **\"Yes\"** outcome.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n\nWith only about 10 days remaining, there is minimal time for significant changes. The current drought conditions are likely to persist, maintaining or slightly increasing the number of residents affected. The forecast would lean strongly towards **\"Yes\"**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n\nIf there were approximately 4 times the time (164 days) until the outcome, there would be ample opportunity for weather patterns to change, potentially alleviating some drought conditions. However, given the existing severity and the population already affected, it is probable that the number of residents in drought conditions would still surpass 300,000. The probability might decrease slightly but would likely remain high.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Drought Conditions:** As of November 12, 2024, about 10% of South Carolina's population is under drought conditions, translating to approximately 500,000 residents. This already surpasses the 300,000 threshold.\n  \n- **Recent Weather Events:** Hurricane Helene and Potential Tropical Cyclone Eight brought significant rainfall, which may have alleviated drought conditions in some areas. However, the overall impact is unlikely to reduce the number of affected residents below 300,000 given the existing drought severity.\n  \n- **Projected Rainfall:** December 2024 is expected to have average or above-average rainfall, which could mitigate drought conditions further. Nevertheless, the short time frame of 41 days limits the extent to which drought areas can be significantly reduced.\n  \n- **Population Base Rate:** With South Carolina's population exceeding 5 million, even a slight reduction in drought-affected areas would likely still result in over 300,000 residents being impacted.\n  \n- **Government Initiatives:** Ongoing water conservation efforts may help manage and reduce the number of residents in drought conditions, but the existing figures suggest that these measures may not be sufficient to bring the number below the threshold within the given time frame.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is some potential for improvement in drought conditions, the probability that at least 300,000 residents remain in drought by December 31, 2024, remains high.\n\n**Probability: 80%**",
