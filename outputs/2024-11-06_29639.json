    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore January 1, 2025, will Stripe announce on the news section of its website that it is planning an IPO?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Stripe, Inc., announces at the News section of its website, before January 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. This section of its website can be accessed at the following link: https://stripe.com/newsroom/news If there is no such announcement before October 1, 2024, this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe news appearing at the specific resolution source is an important part of this forecast, so this question will resolve as No if an IPO announcement does not literally appear on the Newsroom section of Stripe's website, regardless of reporting from any other sources. Likewise, if the News section of its website, currently [here](https://stripe.com/newsroom/news) is unavaliable to Metaculus admins on January 1, 2025, this question resolves as No. \n\nStripe's IPO need not happen before that date, merely the announcement that one is coming.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nStripe, which reported processing a full 1% of global GPD in its most recent [annual letter](https://stripe.com/annual-updates/2023), has long been speculated to be planning an IPO. In February 2024, it announced that its employees could cash out their privately-held shares. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nThe question of whether Stripe will announce an IPO plan on its website before January 1, 2025, is uncertain based on the available information. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Lack of Official Announcement\nAs of the latest reports, Stripe has not officially announced an IPO date. Despite speculation and various indications, there has been no definitive statement from the company regarding an imminent IPO.\n\n## Market Conditions and Company Priorities\nThe current macroeconomic conditions, including elevated interest rates and the upcoming presidential election, may influence Stripe's decision to delay its IPO until more favorable market conditions prevail, potentially in 2025.\n\n## Internal Preparations\nWhile there are signs that Stripe is preparing for a potential IPO, such as publishing financial performance letters and considering strategic changes to its sales model, these actions do not necessarily indicate an immediate IPO announcement.\n\n## Co-Founder Comments\nStripe's co-founders have been evasive about the timing of an IPO, with John Collison stating that there is \"no news to share\" on the matter. This suggests that any announcement might be made at the company's discretion and not necessarily before January 1, 2025.\n\nGiven these points, it is not clear whether Stripe will make an official IPO announcement on its website before January 1, 2025. The decision appears to be contingent on various factors, including market conditions and internal company priorities.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Stripe recently hired investment banks or advisors typically associated with IPO preparations?\nANSWER: Yes, Stripe has recently hired investment banks typically associated with IPO preparations. According to the sources, Stripe hired investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase to advise on the best path forward for a potential IPO or other liquidity options.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Stripe filed confidential paperwork for an IPO with the SEC as of today?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Stripe has filed confidential paperwork for an IPO with the SEC as of today. The sources mention that Stripe has not yet announced an official IPO date and has not filed any initial registration documents with the SEC.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Stripe made corporate governance changes recently that are typical before an IPO?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about Stripe making corporate governance changes that are typically associated with preparations for an Initial Public Offering (IPO). The sources discuss updates to Stripe's restricted and prohibited businesses list, global tax compliance, US verification requirements, and various news announcements, but they do not mention any corporate governance changes related to an IPO.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Stripe customarily announce major corporate developments on its Newsroom website?\nANSWER: Yes, Stripe customarily announces major corporate developments on its Newsroom website. The sources provided indicate that the Newsroom section of Stripe's website includes corporate and product announcements, as well as other significant updates about the company. For example, recent announcements about expanded interoperability, major upgrades to Stripe Billing, new partnerships, and significant strategic changes are all featured on the Newsroom page.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major fintech companies successfully completed IPOs in the past year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence that any major fintech companies have successfully completed IPOs in the past year (2023-2024).\n\n- The sources discuss anticipated IPOs for companies like Stripe, Chime, Plaid, and Cross River Bank, but none of these have been confirmed to have completed their IPOs in the past year.\n- There is also discussion about the challenges faced by fintech companies going public since 2020, including significant declines in their stock prices after IPO, but no specific mention of successful fintech IPOs in the past year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been recent media speculation about an imminent IPO announcement from Stripe?\nANSWER: Yes, there has been recent media speculation about an imminent IPO announcement from Stripe.\n\nSeveral sources indicate that despite the lack of an official announcement, there are various signs and speculations suggesting that Stripe might be preparing for an IPO. For example, Stripe has been valued at around $70 billion recently, has shown significant financial health, and has taken actions such as hiring investment bankers to explore the listing process.\n\nAdditionally, the company's actions, such as publishing financial performance letters and considering options to provide liquidity to employees, have been interpreted by analysts and industry insiders as hints towards a potential IPO.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Stripe executives publicly indicated plans to go public before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES, Stripe executives have publicly indicated plans to consider going public before January 1, 2025, although the exact date is not confirmed.\n\n- In January 2023, Stripe's co-founders, John and Patrick Collison, told employees that they would decide on an IPO within the next year.\n- There are speculations and indications that the IPO could happen as soon as 2024 or potentially in 2025.\n- Despite the lack of a confirmed date, the company's actions and statements suggest they are gearing up for a potential IPO in the near future.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant investor or employee pressure on Stripe to conduct an IPO soon?\nANSWER: Yes, there is significant investor and employee pressure on Stripe to conduct an IPO soon.\n\n- Investors, particularly early backers, are pressing for a return on their investment, and an IPO is seen as one of the fastest ways to provide this liquidity[5|.\n- The company's actions, such as recent employee tender offers, suggest a need to manage investor and employee expectations, indicating pressure to provide liquidity.\n- Analysts and industry insiders note that Stripe is feeling heat from investors who are clamoring for a payday, given the company's long private status and high valuation.\n- The pressure is also driven by the need for early investors to realize their returns, as highlighted by the comments from various industry experts and former employees.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there regulatory or legal obstacles preventing Stripe from announcing an IPO before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: There are no specific regulatory or legal obstacles mentioned in the sources that would prevent Stripe from announcing an IPO before January 1, 2025. However, several factors could influence the timing of the IPO, including:\n\n- Market conditions: Poor and volatile market conditions, as well as upcoming events like the presidential election, could delay the IPO.\n- Regulatory considerations: Changes in regulations, such as data protection laws, anti-money laundering, and fraud prevention rules, could impact Stripe’s business and compliance costs, but these are not obstacles to announcing an IPO.\n- Internal company decisions: Stripe’s decision to go public may be influenced by internal priorities, such as providing liquidity to employees and the company’s growth stage.\n\nTherefore, while there are potential delays due to various factors, there are no explicit regulatory or legal obstacles preventing the announcement of an IPO before January 1, 2025.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as there are no specific regulatory or legal obstacles, but other factors could delay the announcement)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current market conditions favorable for tech company IPOs?\nANSWER: Current market conditions appear to be generally favorable for tech company IPOs, although there are some nuances and potential uncertainties to consider.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n1. **Increased IPO Activity**: The number of tech IPOs has increased in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, with 14 technology IPOs already completed by June 30, 2024.\n\n2. **Successful High-Profile IPOs**: High-profile tech companies like Reddit, Astera Labs, Rubrik, and Ibotta have had successful IPOs in 2024, pricing at or above expectations and currently trading above their initial prices. This suggests evolving investor sentiment and optimism.\n\n3. **Favorable Market Conditions**: The tech sector is experiencing favorable market conditions, including high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, which indicate strong investor interest and optimism about future growth.\n\n4. **Economic and Monetary Factors**: Despite higher interest rates, the environment has become more normalized, and companies are still able to raise capital through IPOs. Decreasing borrowing costs and stabilizing equity markets are expected to boost investments in the tech sector.\n\n5. **Uncertainties**: There are some uncertainties, such as the impact of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, which could introduce volatility and affect IPO timing and investor sentiment. Additionally, inflation rates, although stable, are still above the target rate, which could influence market activity.\n\nOverall, while there are some potential risks and uncertainties, the current market conditions are generally favorable for tech company IPOs.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: Approximately **55 days** remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed**: If nothing changes—meaning Stripe does not announce an IPO on its Newsroom website—the outcome would be **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: With roughly **14 days** left, I would forecast a probability of **10%**.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left**: With about **220 days** remaining, I would forecast a probability of **60%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the information provided up to November 6, 2024, several factors influence the likelihood of Stripe announcing an IPO on its Newsroom website before January 1, 2025:\n\n1. **Time Constraints**: There are approximately 55 days left until the end of the year. Considering the typical timelines and regulatory processes involved in preparing for an IPO, this is a relatively short period.\n\n2. **Lack of Official Filings**: As of today, Stripe has not filed confidential paperwork with the SEC, nor have there been clear indications of corporate governance changes typical before an IPO. This suggests that the preparatory stages may not be far enough along for an imminent announcement.\n\n3. **Market Conditions**: Current market conditions are favorable for tech company IPOs, with increased activity and successful high-profile offerings in 2024. This positive environment could incentivize Stripe to proceed with an IPO announcement.\n\n4. **Investor and Employee Pressure**: There is significant pressure from investors and employees for liquidity, which could motivate the company to move forward sooner rather than later.\n\n5. **Executive Signals**: Stripe executives have publicly indicated plans to go public before January 1, 2025. However, their statements have been somewhat evasive regarding exact timing, suggesting flexibility in their plans.\n\n6. **Media Speculation**: Recent media speculation points toward the possibility of an imminent IPO announcement. While this indicates market anticipation, it does not confirm the company's definitive plans.\n\n7. **Seasonal Considerations**: The end of the year, especially November and December, typically sees lower IPO activity due to holidays and decreased market participation. Companies often avoid this period for major announcements.\n\n**Balancing Factors**:\n\n- **Positive Indicators**: Investor pressure, favorable market conditions, and executive indications support the possibility of an announcement within the remaining timeframe.\n\n- **Negative Indicators**: The lack of official filings, limited time for regulatory processes, and seasonal considerations reduce the likelihood of a pre-January announcement.\n\nConsidering these factors, there is a **moderate chance** that Stripe will make the IPO announcement before January 1, 2025, but the probability is constrained by the time remaining and procedural requirements.\n\n**Probability: 30%**",
