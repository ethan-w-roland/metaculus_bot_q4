    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill November 2024 have a global temperature increase of greater than or equal to 1.25 degrees and less than or equal to 1.31 degrees?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Global Land and Ocean Average Temperature Anomaly for November 2024 is greater than or equal to 1.25 degrees and less than or equal to 1.31 degrees according to NOAA at [this page](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series). Region is \"Global\" and surface is \"Land and Ocean.\"\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/global-temperature-anomalies), \"The term temperature anomaly means a departure from a reference value or long-term average. A positive anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was warmer than the reference value, while a negative anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was cooler than the reference value.\" \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the global temperature increase for November 2024 falling within the range of 1.25°C to 1.31°C above pre-industrial levels, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends and Data\n- The year 2024 is virtually certain to be the warmest on record, with the global average temperature for the first 10 months (January to October) already 0.71°C above the 1991-2020 average and estimated to be more than 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels[1][2][5].\n- The average global temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 is the highest on record for this period, and it is 0.16°C warmer than the same period in 2023[2].\n\n## Monthly Temperature Anomalies\n- October 2024 was the second-warmest October globally, with an average surface air temperature 0.80°C above the 1991-2020 average and 1.65°C above pre-industrial levels[1][2].\n- The past 10 months have seen consistently high temperature anomalies, with 15 out of 16 months exceeding the 1.5°C threshold above pre-industrial levels[1].\n\n## Long-term Context\n- The long-term warming trend is clear, with the past decade being the warmest on record. Global temperatures have been around 1.3°C above pre-industrial levels in recent years, with a range of 1.2°C to 1.4°C across different datasets[5].\n\n## Short-term Variations\n- Global temperatures can be influenced by short-term climate variations such as El Niño and La Niña events. However, despite the fading of the El Niño event that contributed to high temperatures early in 2024, temperatures have remained elevated[5].\n\nGiven these points, while the exact temperature anomaly for November 2024 cannot be predicted with certainty, the following can be inferred:\n\n- The overall trend for 2024 indicates a strong likelihood of continued high temperature anomalies.\n- The range of 1.25°C to 1.31°C above pre-industrial levels is within the realm of possibility, especially considering the average temperature anomalies for the year so far.\n\nHowever, without specific data for November 2024, it is not possible to definitively say whether the temperature increase will fall exactly within this range. The answer to whether November 2024 will have a global temperature increase of greater than or equal to 1.25 degrees and less than or equal to 1.31 degrees is not immediately clear and would require actual data for the month.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming climate events or anomalies expected to significantly impact November 2024 temperatures?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about upcoming climate events or anomalies that are expected to significantly impact November 2024 temperatures. The sources primarily focus on scheduled conferences, webinars, and other events related to climate change discussions, policies, and adaptations, but they do not mention any specific climate events or anomalies affecting temperatures in November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have 15 out of the last 16 months in 2024 had temperature anomalies exceeding 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels?\nANSWER: Yes, the information provided confirms that 15 out of the last 16 months have had temperature anomalies exceeding 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), \"October 2024 was the 15th month in a 16-month period where this threshold was exceeded\"[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the global land and ocean average temperature anomaly for November 2024 less than or equal to 1.31 degrees according to NOAA data?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data for the global land and ocean average temperature anomaly for November 2024. The sources provide detailed information up to October 2024, but they do not include data for November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Was October 2024 one of the warmest October months globally according to NOAA data?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nAccording to NOAA data, October 2024 was the second-warmest October on record globally. The global surface temperature was 1.32°C (2.38°F) above the 20th-century average, making it the second warmest October after October 2023[2][3][4]. Additionally, it was the warmest October on record over global land areas[2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the global land and ocean average temperature anomaly for November 2024 greater than or equal to 1.25 degrees according to NOAA data?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data for the global land and ocean average temperature anomaly for November 2024. The sources provide detailed information up to October 2024, but they do not include data for November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the average global temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 exceeded 1.55 degrees above pre-industrial levels?\nANSWER: No, the average global temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 has not exceeded 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels on a monthly average basis.\n\n- The global average temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 was 0.71°C above the 1991-2020 average, and when adjusted to pre-industrial levels, it is estimated to be around 1.54°C (±0.13) above pre-industrial levels for the period January to September, and similarly for the full 10 months[4][5].\n- It is projected that the annual average for 2024 will likely be more than 1.55°C above pre-industrial levels, but this is based on the full year's data, not just the first 10 months[2][3][5].\n\nTherefore, while the annual average is expected to exceed 1.55°C, the average anomaly for the first 10 months specifically does not exceed this threshold.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a significant influence of El Niño or La Niña on global temperatures in November 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 2024, the influence of either El Niño or La Niña on global temperatures is not yet significant for several reasons:\n\n## Current ENSO Conditions\n- The current conditions in the equatorial Pacific are still in an ENSO-neutral state, meaning neither El Niño nor La Niña is currently active[5].\n\n## Forecasted La Niña\n- While there is a forecasted chance of La Niña developing in the October-December 2024 period, with probabilities ranging from 55% to 57%, it is expected to be a weak event if it does develop[1][3][5].\n\n## Lack of Immediate Impact\n- Since La Niña has not yet formed and is anticipated to be weak, its immediate impact on global temperatures in November 2024 would be minimal[3][5].\n\nTherefore, the significant influence of either El Niño or La Niña on global temperatures in November 2024 is not present.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the long-term global warming trend maintained temperatures around 1.3 degrees above pre-industrial levels in recent years?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the long-term global warming trend has indeed kept global temperatures around 1.3 degrees above pre-industrial levels in recent years, although there is some variation depending on the dataset and the specific time frame considered.\n\n- The Carbon Brief article indicates that global temperatures have been around 1.3°C above pre-industrial levels in recent years, with a range of 1.2°C to 1.4°C across different temperature datasets[1].\n- The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report also mentions that the long-term warming measured over decades remains below 1.5°C, but recent years have seen temperatures close to this mark, with January-September 2024 averaging 1.54°C above pre-industrial levels[2].\n- The Met Office Climate Dashboard provides various indicators of current surface warming, showing that the current magnitude of surface warming is approximately 1.2°C to 1.3°C relative to pre-industrial levels[4].\n\nTherefore, the evidence supports that the long-term global warming trend has maintained temperatures around 1.3 degrees above pre-industrial levels in recent years.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has NOAA reported consistent temperature anomaly data for the first 10 months of 2024 compared to previous years?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nNOAA's reports for the first 10 months of 2024 (January to October) consistently show record-high or near-record-high global temperatures.\n\n- **June 2024** was the warmest June on record, with a global surface temperature 1.22°C (2.20°F) above the 20th-century average[1].\n- **April 2024** was the warmest April on record, with a global surface temperature 1.32°C (2.38°F) above the 20th-century average[2].\n- **July 2024** was the warmest July on record, with a global surface temperature 1.21°C (2.18°F) above the 20th-century average[3].\n- **August 2024** was the warmest August on record, with a global surface temperature 1.27°C (2.29°F) above the 20th-century average[4].\n- **October 2024** had the warmest land temperature on record, although the combined land and ocean temperature was the second warmest, just behind 2023[5].\n\nThese reports indicate a consistent pattern of record or near-record temperature anomalies for the first 10 months of 2024. Additionally, the reports mention that each of the 12 time periods from July 2023 to June 2024 achieved record status for the globe, highlighting the prolonged period of anomalous warmth[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has 2024 been recorded as the warmest year on record globally?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it is virtually certain that 2024 will be the warmest year on record globally, but the year has not yet ended.\n\n- The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) have stated that, based on data up to October 2024, it is virtually certain that 2024 will be the warmest year on record[1][3][4].\n- The average temperature anomaly for the remaining months of 2024 would have to drop to almost zero for 2024 not to break the record, which is highly unlikely[2][4][5].\n\nHowever, since the year 2024 has not yet concluded, the final confirmation will come after the complete data for the year is analyzed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR** (as of the current date, but highly likely to be confirmed once the year is complete).",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nAs of December 4, 2024, the global land and ocean average temperature anomaly for November 2024 has either already been recorded by NOAA or will be available within the next few days. Therefore, the time left until the outcome is known is minimal, likely less than a week.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends continue unchanged, with the first 10 months of 2024 exhibiting exceptionally high temperature anomalies and October 2024 being the second-warmest October on record at 1.32°C above pre-industrial levels, it is likely that November 2024 will follow a similar pattern. Given that October already exceeded the upper bound of 1.31°C, continuing trends suggest that November could maintain or slightly exceed this level.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only a quarter of the time left (assuming more uncertainty and less data), the forecast would account for potential variations. However, given the strong upward trend and the fact that recent months have consistently shown high anomalies, the probability of November 2024 falling within the 1.25°C to 1.31°C range would decrease. In this scenario, I would estimate a lower probability, perhaps around 25%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith four times the time left, there would be ample opportunity to observe any deviations or changes in the trend. However, given the persistent high anomalies in the preceding months, extended observation would likely reinforce the expectation of continued high temperatures. Therefore, the probability of November 2024 falling within the specified range might slightly adjust but remain relatively low, estimated around 30%.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe global temperature anomalies for 2024 have been exceptionally high, with 15 out of the last 16 months exceeding the 1.5°C threshold above pre-industrial levels. October 2024 alone recorded a 1.32°C anomaly, just above the upper limit of the target range for November. While short-term variations like La Niña are not expected to significantly cool global temperatures in November, the prevailing long-term warming trend supports the likelihood of continued high anomalies. The narrow range of 1.25°C to 1.31°C makes the probability of a \"Yes\" outcome relatively low given the recent data.\n\n**Probability: 30%**",
