    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Atlético Mineiro win the 2024 Copa Libertadores?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Atlético Mineiro is the champion of the 2024 Copa Libertadores.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nBACKGROUND:\nCopa Libertadores is South America's top-tier association football championship; the two-legged semifinals for the current tournament take place between October 22nd and 30th, with the single-match final taking place on November 30 at the Monumental stadium in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Atlético Mineiro winning the 2024 Copa Libertadores, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Recent Performance\nAtlético Mineiro has had a strong run in the tournament, eliminating several formidable teams. They defeated San Lorenzo in the Round of 16, the reigning champions Fluminense in the quarter-finals, and River Plate in the semifinals with a decisive 3-0 aggregate victory.\n\n## Team Strength\nAtlético Mineiro has shown stability and strength, particularly in their defense. Their goalkeeper, Everson, has been crucial in critical matches, and the team's solid rear guard has been a key factor in their success. The team is led by Gabriel Milito, who has built a dependable and experienced squad.\n\n## Historical Context\nAtlético Mineiro has previous experience in the Copa Libertadores final, having won the title in 2013. This experience could be an advantage, but it also means they have a significant gap since their last appearance in the final.\n\n## Opponent\nThe final will be an all-Brazilian affair against Botafogo, a team that has also had an impressive run, particularly with their 5-0 victory over Peñarol in the semifinals. Botafogo is seeking their first Copa Libertadores title and has talented players like Thiago Almada.\n\n## Venue and Date\nThe final will be played on November 30, 2024, at the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This neutral ground could affect both teams equally, but the hostile environment might still pose a challenge.\n\n## Base Rates\nBrazilian teams have dominated the Copa Libertadores in recent years, with this being the fourth final between Brazilian teams since 2020. However, this does not guarantee a win for Atlético Mineiro, as Botafogo has shown significant strength and determination in their campaign.\n\nGiven these points, while Atlético Mineiro has a strong case with their recent performance and historical experience, the outcome is not certain. The match against Botafogo will be highly competitive, and several factors could influence the result. Therefore, it is not possible to clearly answer the question with a yes or no based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Atlético Mineiro won the Copa Libertadores prior to 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Atlético Mineiro has won the Copa Libertadores prior to 2024. They won their first Copa Libertadores title in 2013, led by Ronaldinho Gaúcho.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Botafogo seeking their first Copa Libertadores title in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nBotafogo is indeed seeking their first Copa Libertadores title in 2024, as they have advanced to their first Copa Libertadores final in the club's history.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Gabriel Milito won the Copa Libertadores as a coach before 2024?\nANSWER: No, Gabriel Milito has not won the Copa Libertadores as a coach before 2024.

According to the latest standings provided, Botafogo is ranked higher with 64 points from 31 games, while Atlético-MG has 41 points from 30 games.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do betting odds favor Atlético Mineiro to win the 2024 Copa Libertadores?\nANSWER: NO, the betting odds do not favor Atlético Mineiro to win the 2024 Copa Libertadores. According to the betting odds provided, Atlético Mineiro has odds of +600 to win the title, which is not the lowest odds among the contenders. Other Brazilian clubs, such as Flamengo (+400) and Palmeiras (+450), and even River Plate from Argentina (+500), have better odds to win the tournament.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Atlético Mineiro defeated Botafogo in their most recent match before the final?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information about the most recent match between Atlético Mineiro and Botafogo before the final mentioned in the context of the Copa Libertadores final. The sources do mention a match between the two teams on July 7, 2024, where Botafogo won 3-0 against Atlético-MG, but they do not provide details of any matches that may have occurred after this date and before the upcoming final.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the 2024 Copa Libertadores final being played at a neutral venue?\nANSWER: The 2024 Copa Libertadores final is scheduled to be played in Buenos Aires, Argentina, but it is not necessarily at a completely neutral venue in the traditional sense. While the city was chosen as a host, the specific stadium within Buenos Aires has yet to be confirmed. However, since the final will be held in a pre-selected venue within Buenos Aires, which is home to several prominent Argentine football clubs, it does not qualify as a fully neutral venue outside of the competing teams' home cities.\n\nSo, the answer is **NO**, it is not being played at a neutral venue in the strict sense.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Atlético Mineiro conceded fewer goals than Botafogo in the 2024 tournament?\nANSWER: To determine if Atlético Mineiro has conceded fewer goals than Botafogo in the 2024 tournament, we need to look at the goals conceded by each team in the relevant competition.\n\nFor Atlético Mineiro, according to the source, they have conceded a total of 45 goals in the Serie A 2024 season.\n\nFor Botafogo, the source indicates that they have conceded 26 goals in the 2024 season.\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that Botafogo has conceded fewer goals (26) than Atlético Mineiro (45) in the 2024 tournament.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are any key players from Atlético Mineiro injured or suspended for the final?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about the injury or suspension status of Atlético Mineiro players for the final of a particular competition, especially since the sources are dated and do not cover the current or very recent status of the players.\n\n- The sources from August 2024 mention injuries and suspensions for a specific match against CRB, but these do not pertain to the current or final stages of any competition.\n- The more recent source from October 2024 discusses a match against River Plate but does not provide information on player injuries or suspensions for the final.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as the provided sources do not offer the necessary information to determine the injury or suspension status of key players for the final.",
