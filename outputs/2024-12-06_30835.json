    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill France have a new Prime Minister before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2025, [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) report that a new French Prime Minister has been appointed.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- A potential vote of no confidence on the new PM will not affect resolution.\r\n- A caretaker PM will not resolve this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Politico](https://www.politico.eu/article/france-prime-minister-michel-barnier-is-facing-the-chop-what-happens-next-crisis-emmanuel-macron/):\r\n> On Monday, Barnier, the EUâ€™s former chief Brexit negotiator, used a controversial constitutional maneuver to bypass parliament and force through a social security financing bill. In response, the left-wing opposition put forward a no-confidence motion\r\n\r\n[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-turning-point-amid-budget-uncertainty-finance-minister-says-2024-12-03/):\r\n> French lawmakers will vote on Wednesday [December 4] on no-confidence motions which are all but certain to oust the fragile coalition of Prime Minister Michel Barnier, deepening the political crisis in the euro zone's second-largest economy.\r\n> Barring a last-minute surprise, Barnier's will be the first French government to be forced out by a no-confidence vote in more than 60 years, at a time when the country is struggling to tame a massive budget deficit.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the available information, it is highly likely that France will have a new Prime Minister before January 1, 2025. Here are the key points that support this:\n\n- French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that he will name a new prime minister within days following the resignation of Prime Minister Michel Barnier[1][3].\n- Macron faces significant pressure to act swiftly to resolve the current political deadlock and ensure the functioning of the government, particularly to pass a budget law and avoid a shutdown[1][3].\n- The urgency of the situation, including the need to present a special law by mid-December to enable the state to levy taxes from January 1, suggests that the appointment of a new prime minister will be expedited[1].\n\nGiven these factors, it is reasonable to expect that a new prime minister will be named well before January 1, 2025.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Michel Barnier pass?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Michel Barnier passed, as indicated by all the sources. The National Assembly approved the motion with 331 votes, exceeding the minimum of 288 votes needed[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any credible media sources reporting the appointment of a new Prime Minister in France after December 6, 2024?\nANSWER: No credible media sources are reporting the appointment of a new Prime Minister in France after December 6, 2024, as of the provided dates. The sources indicate that President Emmanuel Macron is in the process of selecting a new prime minister but have not confirmed any appointment yet[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the new Prime Minister been officially confirmed by French authorities?\nANSWER: NO, the new Prime Minister has not been officially confirmed by French authorities. According to the sources, President Macron has announced that he will name a new prime minister within days, but no official confirmation of the new prime minister's identity has been made yet[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Emmanuel Macron appointed a new Prime Minister since December 4, 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe source provided does not mention the appointment of a new Prime Minister by President Emmanuel Macron as of December 6, 2024. It only states that Macron vowed to appoint a new prime minister in the coming days, but it does not confirm if this appointment has already occurred[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the budget law a critical factor influencing the appointment of a new Prime Minister in France?\nANSWER: Yes, the budget law is a critical factor influencing the appointment of a new Prime Minister in France in this context.\n\nThe no-confidence vote that led to the ousting of Prime Minister Michel Barnier was primarily triggered by his proposed austerity budget and his use of the constitutional mechanism (Article 49.3) to pass the budget without parliamentary approval. This move was deeply contentious and led to strong opposition from both the far-right and left-wing lawmakers, resulting in the successful no-confidence vote[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the budget law and the associated political disputes were the key factors leading to the need for President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a new prime minister.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to appoint a new Prime Minister following the no-confidence vote?\nANSWER: YES\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to appoint a new prime minister \"in the coming days\" following the no-confidence vote that brought down the government[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the French government currently operating under a caretaker Prime Minister?\nANSWER: To determine if the French government is currently operating under a caretaker Prime Minister, we need to consider the current political situation in France as of the given date (Friday, December 06, 2024).\n\n1. **Definition of Caretaker Prime Minister**: A caretaker government or prime minister is typically appointed to manage the government until a new government can be formed, often after an election or a political crisis.\n\n2. **Current Political Situation**: As of my last update, I do not have real-time access to current events. However, to answer this question accurately, one would need to check the latest news or official announcements from France regarding the status of the prime minister and the government.\n\nSince I do not have access to real-time data or specific information about the current status of the French government as of December 6, 2024, I cannot definitively say whether the French government is operating under a caretaker Prime Minister.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a consensus within the ruling coalition on a candidate for the new Prime Minister?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer to whether there is a consensus within the ruling coalition on a candidate for the new Prime Minister varies by country:\n\n## India:\nThere is no indication of a lack of consensus on the Prime Minister candidate within the ruling coalition in India. Narendra Modi, who has been the Prime Minister, continues in his role despite the BJP not having an absolute majority. The coalition dynamics involve other parties, but there is no mention of disagreement over Modi's position as Prime Minister[1][4].\n\n## Ireland:\nThe article does not indicate a consensus on a new Prime Minister within the ruling coalition in Ireland. Instead, it mentions negotiations and a struggle to forge a new coalition government, with different parties and leaders involved in the process[2].\n\n## France:\nThere is no consensus within the left-wing coalition in France on a candidate for the Prime Minister. The coalition is divided, with different parties having different preferences and negotiations being suspended at one point[3].\n\n## Japan:\nThe article does not discuss a consensus on a Prime Minister candidate within the ruling coalition in Japan. It focuses on the potential coalition formations and the need for the LDP to find new partners to form a government, but does not address the specific issue of consensus on a Prime Minister candidate[5].\n\nGiven the varying situations in different countries, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant political obstacles delaying the appointment of a new Prime Minister in France?\nANSWER: Yes, there are significant political obstacles delaying the appointment of a new Prime Minister in France. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Parliamentary Divisions**: The French parliament is currently divided among several minority blocs, with no single party holding a majority. This makes it challenging for the new prime minister to form a stable government and pass legislation, including a new budget bill[1][3][5].\n\n2. **Previous Delays**: Macron took more than two months to appoint Michel Barnier after his party's defeat in June's legislative elections, raising concerns about potential delays this time as well[1][3][4].\n\n3. **Need for Centrist Candidate**: The new prime minister needs to be someone who can appeal to both sides of the political spectrum, which is a difficult task given the current political landscape. French media have reported a shortlist of centrist candidates, but no names have been confirmed yet[1][3][5].\n\n4. **Pressure and Opposition**: The no-confidence vote has galvanized opposition leaders, with some calling for Macron's resignation and others warning of increasing pressure on the president. This political tension adds to the complexity of appointing a new prime minister[1][3][4].\n\n5. **Constitutional Constraints**: The French constitution does not allow for new legislative elections until at least July 2025, creating a potential stalemate for policymakers and adding to the urgency of finding a suitable candidate for the prime minister position[1][3][4].\n\nThese factors collectively indicate significant political obstacles in the appointment of a new Prime Minister in France.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any legal or constitutional challenges affecting the appointment of a new Prime Minister in France?\nANSWER: There have been several legal and constitutional considerations and challenges surrounding the appointment and tenure of the new Prime Minister in France, particularly in the context of Michel Barnier's appointment and subsequent resignation.\n\n1. **Constitutional Mechanisms and Constraints**: The appointment of Michel Barnier was made under significant constitutional scrutiny. President Macron's delay in appointing a new Prime Minister after the legislative elections raised questions about the constitutionality of the delay, although Article 8 of the French Constitution does not specify deadlines or criteria for the appointment[2].\n\n2. **Use of Article 49.3**: Barnier invoked Article 49.3 of the French Constitution to push through the 2025 budget without parliamentary approval. This move, while constitutional, exposed the government to no-confidence motions, which ultimately led to Barnier's resignation[1][3][4].\n\n3. **No-Confidence Vote**: The no-confidence vote that ousted Barnier was a direct result of the political and constitutional mechanisms in place. The opposition's ability to initiate this vote highlights the checks and balances within the French system[1][3][4].\n\n4. **Caretaker Government**: The period between the resignation of the previous government and the appointment of a new Prime Minister has raised questions about the powers and boundaries of a caretaker government, an area where French law and case law are sparse[2].\n\n5. **Presidential Discretion and Constitutional Role**: There has been debate over whether President Macron overstepped his constitutional role by not delegating the task of forming a government coalition and by choosing a Prime Minister from a party without a parliamentary majority. However, these actions remain within the broad discretion granted by the Constitution[2].\n\nThese points indicate that while the appointments and actions were within the constitutional framework, they have been subject to significant legal and constitutional scrutiny and debate.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- **Time Left:** 25 days (from December 6, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- **Outcome if Nothing Changed:** If no new Prime Minister is appointed within the remaining 25 days, the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- **Time Frame with a Quarter Left:** Approximately 6 days.\n- **Forecast:** Given the extremely short time frame, the probability of appointing a new Prime Minister within 6 days would significantly decrease.  \n  **Probability:** 40%\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- **Time Frame with 100 Days Left:** Extending the deadline to around April 15, 2025.\n- **Forecast:** With a longer time frame, Macron would have ample time to navigate political negotiations, overcome obstacles, and appoint a new Prime Minister.  \n  **Probability:** 95%\n\n**Rationale:**\nAs of December 6, 2024, France is in a critical political juncture following the successful no-confidence vote that ousted Prime Minister Michel Barnier. President Emmanuel Macron has publicly committed to appointing a new Prime Minister \"in the coming days,\" driven by the urgent need to pass the budget law and stabilize the government. Historical precedents indicate that Macron took approximately two months to appoint Barnier after legislative elections, suggesting a deliberate but potentially lengthy process. However, the current political climate exerts significant pressure to expedite the appointment to avoid governmental paralysis.\n\nThe remaining 25 days present a tight window. The strong motivation for Macron to act, combined with the absence of major legal or constitutional barriers, increases the likelihood of a swift appointment. While bureaucratic delays or unforeseen political complexities could pose risks, the overarching urgency and Macron's commitment provide a solid foundation for optimism.\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
