    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs exceed 590 on November 29, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-11\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of active drilling rigs exceeds 590 on November 29, 2024, according to the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count, which can be accessed at [this](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_rotary_rigs) Ycharts link. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe total number of active drilling rigs includes the total of those classified as oil, gas, and miscellaneous. The link will be accessed by Metaculus Admins on or around November 30, 2024. In case of its inaccessibility, the secondary resolution source will be from Baker Hughes itself at [this link](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count). If both resolution links remain inaccessible by the end of the tournament, the question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBaker Hughes [issues](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/) US oil rig counts every Friday, and issued rig counts to the oil & gas industry since 1944. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the number of active US drilling rigs will exceed 590 on November 29, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Rig Count\nAs of the week ending November 1, 2024, the Baker Hughes U.S. rotary drilling rig count was 585, which is unchanged from the previous week and down by 33 from the same period a year ago[3].\n\n## Recent Trends\nOver the last few weeks, the rig count has been relatively stable, with some minor fluctuations. For example, in the eight weeks leading up to November 1, the rig count was unchanged in two weeks, down in four weeks, and up in two weeks[3].\n\n## Forecast and Predictions\nAnalysts predict that the average active onshore rig count in the US will be around 674 in 2024, which is a 3% decrease from 2023. However, there is an expectation of a slight increase in rig counts towards the end of 2024 due to upcoming gas pipeline projects, but this impact is likely to be more significant in 2025[1].\n\n## Specific Basin Activity\nThe Permian Basin, which is the most active basin, had 303 active rigs as of the week ending November 1, 2024, down by one from the previous week. This basin is expected to see increased activity once new gas pipelines come online, but this is anticipated to have a more pronounced effect in 2025[3].\n\nGiven these points, while there is a possibility of minor fluctuations, the current trend and forecasts suggest that the rig count is likely to remain relatively stable around the current levels. However, exceeding 590 rigs by November 29, 2024, is not clearly ruled out but seems unlikely based on recent stability and minor decreases.\n\n### Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- The current base rate is around 585 rigs.\n- The time to resolution is short, as we are only looking ahead to the end of November.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Historical data shows that rig counts can fluctuate but have generally been stable in recent weeks.\n- Analyst forecasts suggest a holding pattern for the next year with slight increases anticipated towards the end of 2024 and into 2025.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- Natural gas prices have been a significant factor, but they have stabilized somewhat, which could influence drilling activity.\n- Upcoming pipeline projects are expected to increase takeaway capacity, but their impact is more likely to be felt in 2025.\n\nIn summary, while it is possible for the rig count to exceed 590 by November 29, 2024, the current trends and forecasts do not strongly indicate a significant increase above this level in the short term.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have oil prices risen significantly in the past few weeks?\nANSWER: Yes, oil prices have risen significantly in the past few weeks, primarily due to escalating conflicts in the Middle East.\n\n- According to ABC News, oil prices surged about 13% over an 11-day stretch ending recently, driven by an escalation of conflicts in the Middle East[2].\n- The EIA also notes that crude oil prices have risen in recent days due to the same conflicts[3].\n\nThese sources indicate a significant increase in oil prices in the recent period.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a seasonal trend of increasing rig counts in November in previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence to suggest a consistent seasonal trend of increasing rig counts specifically in November in previous years.\n\n- The sources discuss general trends and fluctuations in rig counts over various periods, including the impact of seasonal changes, budget cycles, and efficiency improvements. However, they do not specifically highlight a consistent increase in rig counts in November[2][4][5].\n- Typically, rig counts can decline after the year-end due to the end of spending budgets and winter weather increasing costs, but this does not indicate a specific increase in November[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current natural gas prices encouraging more drilling for gas rigs?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nCurrent natural gas prices are not encouraging more drilling for gas rigs. According to the sources, when natural gas prices are low, producers often decrease their drilling activity, reducing the number of active drilling rigs deployed. For example, in 2023, as natural gas prices fell below $4.00/MMBtu and averaged $2.50/MMBtu from January through October, the number of active U.S. natural gas-directed rigs began to decline[4].\n\nAdditionally, industry executives have noted that the current natural gas prices are not sustainable for exploration and development, particularly for small operators[3]. This indicates that the current price environment is not incentivizing increased drilling activity for natural gas.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the number of active US drilling rigs exceeded 590 in any week during the past month?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the number of active US drilling rigs has not exceeded 590 in any week during the past month.\n\n- As of November 1, 2024, the US Rig Count was at 585, which is below 590[1].\n- The historical data for the past few weeks also shows that the rig count has been below 590. For example, on October 11, 2024, the total rigs were 586, and on October 4, 2024, they were 585[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nNO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are industry forecasts predicting an increase in the US rig count in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the forecasts do not indicate an increase in the US rig count for November 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The US oil and gas rig count has remained unchanged at 585 for the third consecutive week, with no indication of an increase[3][4][5].\n- The total rig count is down by 31 rigs (5%) compared to the same period last year, and there is no mention of an expected increase in the near term[3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has recent global demand for oil increased, prompting more US drilling activity?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nRecent global demand for oil has not increased in a way that would prompt more US drilling activity. Here are the key points:\n\n- Global oil demand growth is expected to ease significantly. In 2023, world oil demand was adjusted lower due to a weakening macroeconomic climate, and for 2024, demand growth is forecasted to halve to 1.1 mb/d[1].\n- Despite record US oil production, the overall trend in drilling activity has been influenced more by technological efficiencies and productivity gains rather than an increase in demand. US producers are able to produce more oil with fewer rigs due to advancements in drilling and completion technologies[3][4][5].\n- The US rig count has remained relatively flat or even decreased in some periods, despite the high production levels, indicating that increased drilling activity is not necessary to meet current production commitments[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major US oil and gas companies announced increased capital expenditures for drilling this month?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that major US oil and gas companies have announced increased capital expenditures for drilling specifically this month.\n\n- ExxonMobil's capital spending plans for 2024 were outlined earlier in the year, with expectations of $23-25 billion, which is a decrease from 2023[4].\n- The Oil & Gas Journalâ€™s annual capital spending survey indicated that US E&P companies are planning to decrease their total capital expenditure in 2024 compared to the previous year[4].\n- There is no mention in the recent announcements, such as ExxonMobil's third-quarter results, of any new increases in capital expenditures for drilling this month[1].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent change in government policies that could boost drilling activity?\nANSWER: While there have been recent changes in government policies related to oil and gas drilling, they do not necessarily aim to boost drilling activity but rather to make the process more responsible and financially fair to taxpayers.\n\n- The Interior Department has finalized a rule to revise the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) oil and gas leasing regulations, which includes increasing royalty rates for oil drilling to 16.67 percent and raising the minimum leasing bond to $150,000. These changes are intended to provide a fair return to taxpayers and ensure companies meet their obligations for site cleanup, rather than to increase drilling activity[4].\n- There have been discussions and analyses on the impact of various policies on oil and gas production, but the recent changes are more focused on ensuring responsible development and environmental accountability rather than boosting drilling activity[3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, as the recent changes are not aimed at boosting drilling activity.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any infrastructure developments recently been completed that could enable increased drilling?\nANSWER: Yes, several infrastructure developments have recently been completed or are underway that could enable increased drilling, particularly in the Permian region.\n\n1. **New Pipeline Capacity**: Projects such as the expansion of Enbridge's Gray Oak pipeline, which will increase Permian takeaway capacity by 120,000 b/d before the end of 2025, are expected to alleviate transportation constraints and support increased production[1].\n\n2. **Natural Gas Pipelines**: The Matterhorn Express Pipeline, set to enter service in the third quarter of 2024, will transport up to 2.5 Bcf/d of natural gas from the Waha Hub in West Texas to Katy, Texas. This pipeline will help in moving natural gas production from the Permian Basin to demand centers[1].\n\nThese infrastructure developments are crucial for supporting the increased drilling and production activities in the Permian region.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any announced plans for significant increases in drilling activity before November 29, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are some indications of drilling activity trends, but no clear announcements of significant increases in drilling activity specifically before November 29, 2024.\n\n- The sources indicate that U.S. drilling activity is expected to remain relatively flat or see only marginal increases in 2024. For example, one source predicts a 0.6% increase in U.S. drilling to 18,015 wells in 2024, with footage drilled expected to decline slightly[3][5].\n- Global drilling activity outside the U.S. is forecasted to see some growth, but the specific timing and whether it applies before November 29, 2024, is not clearly stated[2].\n- There are some regional increases, such as in Guyana and Suriname, and in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, but these are not described as significant increases before the specified date[2][4].\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are 18 days left until November 29, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, the number of active US drilling rigs would remain at 585, as reported on November 1, 2024. Therefore, the rig count would not exceed 590 on November 29, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately 4.5 days left, it's highly unlikely that the rig count would increase by more than 5 rigs to exceed 590. I would forecast a very low probability, around **5%**, that the rig count would exceed 590 in that short time frame.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nIf there were about 72 days until November 29, 2024, extending the date into early 2025, there would be more time for factors like infrastructure developments and market changes to impact the rig count. In that case, I would forecast a higher probability, around **30%**, that the rig count might exceed 590.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Rig Count:** The number of active US drilling rigs is 585 as of November 1, 2024. This is unchanged from the previous week and down by 33 rigs compared to the same period a year ago.\n\n- **Recent Trends:** The rig count has been relatively stable with minor fluctuations. Over the past eight weeks, the rig count was unchanged in two weeks, decreased in four weeks, and increased in two weeks.\n\n- **Oil Prices:** While oil prices have risen significantly in recent weeks due to escalating conflicts in the Middle East, it typically takes longer than a few weeks for such price changes to translate into increased drilling activity and higher rig counts.\n\n- **Natural Gas Prices:** Current natural gas prices are low, which does not encourage increased drilling for gas rigs. This limits the likelihood of a significant increase in the total rig count from gas-directed rigs.\n\n- **Industry Forecasts:** Analysts are not predicting a substantial increase in the rig count for November 2024. Any anticipated increases due to infrastructure developments, such as new pipelines, are expected to have a more pronounced effect in 2025.\n\n- **Company Expenditures:** Major US oil and gas companies have not announced increased capital expenditures for drilling this month, indicating that a surge in drilling activity is unlikely in the near term.\n\n- **Infrastructure Developments:** While new pipelines and infrastructure projects are underway, their impact on increasing drilling activity is expected to unfold over a longer time horizon than the next 18 days.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the short time frame until November 29, 2024, and the absence of strong indicators for a rapid increase in drilling activity, it is unlikely that the number of active US drilling rigs will exceed 590. Taking into account the potential for minor fluctuations and unexpected developments, I estimate the probability as follows:\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
