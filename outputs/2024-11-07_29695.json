    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill there be major civil unrest or rioting in the US before 1 January 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-07\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) report that after 5 November 2024 and before 1 January 2025 rioting or civil unrest in the US leads to either:\n-  The deaths of at least 10 people due to the actions of rioters or other civilians, or police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents.\n- The arrest of at least 1,000 people by police, military, national guard, or other law enforcement or government agents.\n\nThese counts will be cumulative from November 6th, 2024 to December 31st, 2024, inclusive. Deaths and arrests need not be from a single instance of unrest.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- For deaths to count toward the overall death toll, the deaths have to occur within the context of an event of rioting or civil unrest; deaths from a generic mass shooting or a series of homicides that occur outside of the context of a riot shouldn't count. Further, deaths that occur due to medical emergencies that aren't related to rioting or unrest do not count (for example, someone dying of a heart attack while in a crowd of rioters). Suicides also do not count.\n- Arrests must also be made in the context of an event of rioting or civil unrest.\n- In case of ambiguity, Metaculus admins may wait up to 1 month after the question's closing date to make a determination.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIncidents of [civil unrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_incidents_of_civil_unrest_in_the_United_States) are not uncommon in the United States, but large-scale rioting is quite rare. One of the most severe incidents in recent history was the [1992 Los Angeles riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots), during which more than 60 people were killed, more than 2,350 people were injured, and more than 12,000 people were arrested. Property damage was estimated at more than $1bn.\n\nMore recently, in 2020, mass civil unrest occurred in the United States [in response to the killing of George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests). 19 people died, more than 14,000 people were arrested, and insured damages were estimated to be $1-2bn.\n\nIn January 2021, the United States Capitol Building [was stormed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_storming_of_the_United_States_Capitol) by partisans as Congress was attempting to certify the electoral college result in the 2020 election. Five people died, and dozens of arrests have been made.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nThe possibility of major civil unrest or rioting in the US before January 1, 2025, particularly around the 2024 presidential election, is a significant concern based on several factors and sources:\n\n## Risk Factors\n- The 2024 presidential election is highly contentious, with elevated tensions and political polarization. This environment is ripe for unrest, especially given the historical context of the January 6, 2021, Capitol riots and other recent violent incidents.\n\n## Extremist Threats\n- Both far-right and far-left extremist groups have made threats of violence, regardless of the election outcome. Far-right groups, in particular, have been vocal about their dissatisfaction and have called for action if their preferred candidate loses.\n\n## Key Dates and Events\n- Critical dates such as the electoral vote certification on January 6, 2025, and the presidential inauguration on January 20, 2025, are identified as potential flashpoints for violence and civil unrest. These events could attract extremist groups and lead to confrontations.\n\n## Social Media and Rhetoric\n- The escalating rhetoric on social media and from political figures is seen as a significant factor that could incite violence. This rhetoric has the potential to mobilize extremist elements and create an environment conducive to politically-motivated violence.\n\n## Law Enforcement and Preparedness\n- Law enforcement agencies are preparing for potential unrest, acknowledging the heightened threat environment. However, the unpredictability of lone actor violence and the difficulty in monitoring all potential threats remain significant challenges.\n\n## Geographic and Demographic Factors\n- Urban-rural divisions and the lack of geographical safe havens for extremist groups reduce the likelihood of a full-scale civil war but do not eliminate the risk of localized and widespread violence.\n\n## Public and Expert Concerns\n- Surveys indicate that a majority of Americans are concerned about the possibility of election-related violence. Experts and risk management companies also highlight the increased risk of civil unrest, particularly in swing states and major urban centers.\n\nWhile the likelihood of full-scale civil war is considered low, the risk of significant civil unrest, protests, and violence around key election-related events is deemed quite high by various analyses and reports. Therefore, it is reasonable to anticipate some level of civil unrest or rioting before January 1, 2025, although the exact extent and severity are difficult to predict.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the result of the 2024 United States presidential election been contested or legally challenged by any major candidates?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the result of the 2024 United States presidential election has been contested or legally challenged by any major candidates. The sources mention the election results, the winners, and the reactions of the candidates, but they do not mention any legal challenges or contests to the election results.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been reports of large-scale protests or demonstrations in the United States since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about large-scale protests or demonstrations in the United States since November 5, 2024. The sources discuss anticipated and past events, but they do not provide real-time or post-November 5, 2024, data on protests or demonstrations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant increase in online extremist rhetoric or coordination in the United States since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or information that addresses the period immediately after November 5, 2024. The sources discuss the threat environment and extremist activities leading up to the 2024 election, but they do not provide details on what has happened since November 5, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether there has been a significant increase in online extremist rhetoric or coordination in the United States since November 5, 2024, is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been incidents of civil unrest in the United States resulting in deaths or mass arrests since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about incidents of civil unrest resulting in deaths or mass arrests in the United States since November 5, 2024.\n\n- The sources provide information on potential risks and anticipations of civil unrest around the 2024 elections, historical incidents of civil unrest, and specific incidents up to early 2024, but they do not include details of events occurring after November 5, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the winner of the 2024 United States presidential election been officially declared as of November 7, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 7, 2024, the winner of the 2024 United States presidential election has been widely reported and acknowledged, but the official declaration may not have been finalized through all the formal processes.\n\n- Multiple sources indicate that Donald Trump has been declared the winner by various news outlets and has claimed victory himself.\n- However, the official declaration typically involves the certification of electoral votes, which may not have been completed as of November 7.\n\nGiven this, while it is clear that Donald Trump is the projected winner, the official declaration might still be in the process of being finalized.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have federal agencies issued recent reports indicating a high risk of domestic terrorism or civil unrest in the United States?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nFederal agencies have indeed issued recent reports indicating a high risk of domestic terrorism and civil unrest in the United States.\n\n- The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released the 2024 Homeland Threat Assessment, which continues to identify a high risk of domestic terrorism, highlighting that the threat of violence from individuals radicalized in the U.S. remains high, particularly through lone offenders or small group attacks.\n- The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that domestic terrorism incidents have increased significantly, with a 357% rise between 2013 and 2021, and noted that domestic terrorism-related investigations have more than doubled since 2020.\n- The National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin from May 2023 also indicated a heightened threat environment due to domestic violent extremists and other ideological motivations, highlighting potential targets such as critical infrastructure, faith-based institutions, and government facilities.\n\nThese reports collectively underscore the ongoing and significant risk of domestic terrorism and civil unrest in the U.S.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any extremist groups in the United States publicly declared intent to engage in violent actions following the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence to suggest that extremist groups in the United States have indicated a potential for violent actions, although it is not explicitly stated that they have publicly declared an intent to engage in violent actions specifically following the 2024 election.\n\n- The sources highlight a heightened risk of extremist violence around the 2024 presidential election, with both far-right and far-left extremist groups posing threats. For example, far-right extremists are noted to be a significant threat, given the precedent of violence on January 6, 2021, and ongoing violent rhetoric.\n- There are mentions of extremist groups participating in demonstrations and political violence, and the possibility of attacks against government buildings and law enforcement officials in the post-election era, driven by political rhetoric and extremist ideologies.\n- However, these sources do not provide a direct quote or explicit statement from any extremist group publicly declaring their intent to engage in violent actions immediately following the 2024 election.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the United States experienced incidents of civil unrest leading to at least 10 deaths or 1,000 arrests in the past five years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence of significant civil unrest and violence in the United States over the past five years, but the specific criteria of at least 10 deaths or 1,000 arrests in a single incident is not explicitly met in the sources.\n\n- The January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol resulted in several deaths and numerous arrests, but the sources do not specify that it reached the threshold of 10 deaths or 1,000 arrests. For example, the sources mention that the event was violent and resulted in arrests, but they do not provide the exact numbers that meet the criteria.\n\n- There are mentions of widespread demonstrations, protests, and violence across various locations, including the 2020 presidential election and subsequent events, but these are described in terms of overall trends and multiple incidents rather than a single event meeting the specified thresholds.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it is unclear if any single incident of civil unrest in the past five years has resulted in at least 10 deaths or 1,000 arrests.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have United States law enforcement agencies issued warnings about potential civil unrest in the aftermath of the 2024 election?\nANSWER: YES\n\nUnited States law enforcement agencies have indeed issued warnings and taken precautions regarding potential civil unrest in the aftermath of the 2024 election. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- Law enforcement agencies across the country are intensifying security efforts to ensure safe voting and protect democratic processes, with a focus on preparing for any potential issues that may arise during and after the election.\n- There are concerns about violent extremists exploiting the polarized political environment, leading to potential attacks at mass gatherings, including polling places and protests.\n- The FBI and other law enforcement agencies have emphasized their commitment to a safe election process and have warned about the potential for violence or threats to national security, which would be swiftly investigated and addressed.\n- Preparations include training for handling election-related incidents, sharing real-time information, and developing plans to address outbreaks of violence and large-scale protests.\n\nThese measures and warnings indicate that law enforcement agencies are actively preparing for and warning about potential civil unrest related to the 2024 election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any prominent political figures called for protests or civil disobedience since the 2024 United States presidential election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence that some figures have called for or been associated with protests and civil disobedience in the context of the 2024 United States presidential election and related political tensions.\n\n1. **Venancio Mondlane**, an opposition leader in Mozambique, is not directly related to the U.S. election, but the context of calling for protests is relevant. However, for the U.S. specifically:\n   - In the U.S., the article about the 2024 elections mentions that \"Experts have expressed concern that no matter which party wins, segments of the population will refuse to accept the results, leading to clashes, protests, and possibly more severe unrest\".\n\n2. **Venancio Mondlane's** actions, though in Mozambique, illustrate a broader trend of opposition leaders calling for protests. However, for a U.S. context:\n   - The ACLU has indicated a readiness to challenge any actions by the Trump administration that target dissent and protests, suggesting an anticipation of potential civil disobedience and protests in response to government actions.\n\n3. **Specific Calls for Protests in the U.S.:**\n   - While the sources do not specify a prominent U.S. political figure directly calling for protests immediately after the 2024 election, they do highlight ongoing tensions and the likelihood of protests. For instance, the pro-Palestinian demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention and other political gatherings indicate a volatile environment where protests are likely to occur.\n\nGiven the information, it is clear that there are anticipations and preparations for potential protests and civil disobedience, but there is no direct quote or clear evidence of a prominent U.S. political figure explicitly calling for protests immediately following the 2024 presidential election.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nThere are 55 days remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changes and no significant incidents of civil unrest or rioting occur that meet the specified criteria, the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately 14 days left until January 1, 2025, I would forecast a lower probability, around **10%**, of the question resolving as **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nIf there were about 220 days remaining (extending the deadline to July 2025), I would forecast a higher probability, around **25%**, of the question resolving as **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 7, 2024, there have been no reports of major civil unrest or rioting in the United States that meet the specified criteria since November 5, 2024. The subquestions indicate that:\n\n- **No major candidates have contested or legally challenged the election results**, reducing the likelihood of immediate post-election unrest.\n- **Large-scale protests or demonstrations since November 5, 2024, are unclear**, suggesting that no significant events have been reported yet.\n- **There is no clear evidence of a significant increase in extremist rhetoric or coordination**, which might otherwise indicate rising tensions.\n- **Federal agencies have issued warnings about potential civil unrest and a high risk of domestic terrorism**, highlighting ongoing concerns.\n- **Law enforcement agencies are preparing for potential unrest**, which may deter or mitigate possible incidents.\n\n**Factors increasing the probability:**\n\n- **Historical precedents**: The 2020 George Floyd protests and the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot both escalated rapidly and led to significant deaths and arrests.\n- **Political polarization**: The country remains highly polarized, and contentious elections can spark unrest.\n- **Warnings from federal agencies**: Indicate credible threats that could materialize into actual events.\n\n**Factors decreasing the probability:**\n\n- **No current incidents**: There have been no significant events since the election, and time is passing without major unrest.\n- **Election results appear accepted**: With no major legal challenges, there's less impetus for election-related unrest.\n- **Law enforcement preparedness**: Increased security measures may prevent or quickly contain potential incidents.\n- **Limited timeframe**: With only 55 days remaining, the window for such events is narrowing.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\nWhile the risk factors cannot be ignored, the absence of immediate unrest following the election and proactive measures by law enforcement reduce the likelihood of the question resolving as **Yes**. The probability is not negligible due to the volatile political climate and warnings issued but remains relatively low.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
