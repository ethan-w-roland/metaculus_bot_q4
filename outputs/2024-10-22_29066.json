{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill RCP's polling bias for Trump based on national polls in the month before the 2024 election be greater than -1.0 and less than 0 percentage points?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThe question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump's national polling bias when using the October 17 [RealClear Polling (RCP) average](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris) of a -1.583 percentage point spread (Trump) is strictly greater than -1.0 pp and strictly less than 0 pp. \n\nThis will be calculated as -1.583 percentage points (pp), minus Trump's popular vote percentage (expressed in pp), plus Harris' popular vote percentage (in pp).\n\nBACKGROUND:\nPolling bias is calculated by subtracting the actual voting percentage spread from the pre-election polled percentage spread of the candidate in question. For example, [Activote's](https://www.activote.net/polling-analysis/) national 2020 poll reported Trump trailing Biden by a 6 percentage point spread. The actual election resulted in 51.31% votes for Biden and 46.85% for Trump, a -4.46pp spread. Trump's polling bias was then \\(-6pp-(-4.46pp) = -1.54pp \\).\n\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/) estimated a polling bias of +4.1pp for the Biden in 2020 and +3.3pp for Clinton in 2016. However, it found almost no weighted-average polling bias in the 2022 midterm election. The \"shy Trump voter hypothesis\" suggests one possible reason for the bias in 2016 and 2020 is that Trump voters were reluctant to respond or respond accurately to the polls. Authors from [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/11/02/shy-trump-voters-myth/), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/1/21544644/shy-trump-voters-polling-error-explained), and others have questioned this hypothesis.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the RealClearPolitics (RCP) polling bias for Trump based on national polls in the month before the 2024 election will be greater than -1.0 and less than 0 percentage points, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context\nIn the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, polls consistently underestimated Donald Trump's support. In 2016, polls were off by an average of 1.8 points in swing states, and in 2020, they were off by 1.1 points in Trump's favor nationally, with significant underestimation in key states like Wisconsin.\n\n## Current Polling Dynamics\n- The current polls show a very tight race, with margins in key states often within a single percentage point. This closeness suggests that small biases could significantly impact the outcome.\n- There are concerns about nonresponse bias, particularly among Trump supporters who may be less inclined to participate in polls due to distrust of institutions like pollsters and journalists. This bias could lead to an underestimation of Trump's support.\n\n## Learning from Past Elections\n- Pollsters have made efforts to learn from past mistakes, such as adjusting for turnout estimates and better representing rural and white, non-college-educated voters. However, there is still uncertainty about whether these adjustments will be sufficient to avoid biases seen in previous elections.\n\n## Possible Scenarios\n- One scenario suggests that Trump could outperform the polls again, similar to 2016 and 2020, which would mean the bias could be positive (i.e., greater than 0 percentage points).\n- Another scenario suggests that pollsters might overcompensate for past biases, potentially leading to an underestimation of Trump's support being corrected, or even an overestimation of his support, though this is less likely given historical trends.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The historical base rate indicates that polls have consistently underestimated Trump's support. However, the 2022 midterms showed a different pattern where polls overestimated Republican performance, suggesting that pollsters' methods and voter demographics can vary significantly between midterm and presidential elections.\n\nGiven these points, while it is possible that the polling bias could be within the specified range (greater than -1.0 and less than 0 percentage points), the historical context and ongoing concerns about nonresponse bias suggest that the bias might still favor Trump (i.e., greater than 0 percentage points). However, the outcome is not clear-cut, and multiple scenarios are plausible.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer to whether RCP's polling bias for Trump will be greater than -1.0 and less than 0 percentage points is not immediately clear. Historical trends suggest a potential for positive bias (underestimation of Trump's support), but adjustments made by pollsters and varying voter dynamics introduce uncertainty. Therefore, it cannot be definitively answered as yes or no based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do current national polls as of October 2023 show a close race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided are from October 2024, not October 2023. Therefore, they do not reflect the polling data for October 2023, and it is unclear what the national polls showed at that specific time. The information given is relevant only to the current state of the polls in October 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did national polls in the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections underestimate Donald Trump's support by more than 1 percentage point?\nANSWER: Yes, national polls in the 2016 and 2020 U.S. presidential elections did underestimate Donald Trump's support by more than 1 percentage point.\n\nIn the 2016 election, polls showed Hillary Clinton with an average lead of about 3.5%, but the actual result was a 2% lead for Clinton, indicating an underestimation of Trump's support by about 1.5 percentage points.\n\nIn the 2020 election, polls indicated Joe Biden had an 8% lead, but the actual result was a 4.5% lead for Biden, which means Trump's support was underestimated by about 3.5 percentage points.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did polls for the 2022 U.S. midterm elections overestimate Republican support?\nANSWER: No, the polls for the 2022 U.S. midterm elections did not overestimate Republican support. In fact, the evidence suggests that the polls were generally accurate and, if anything, slightly underestimated Democratic support.\n\n- FiveThirtyEight's analysis indicates that while some pollsters had poor performances, the aggregate polls were quite accurate. They slightly underestimated Democratic support, but the differences were modest.\n- The polls did not significantly overestimate Republican support; instead, they were close to the actual results, with some partisan polls commissioned by Republicans potentially skewing the averages but not reflecting the overall accuracy of non-partisan polling.\n\nOverall, the 2022 midterm election polls are described as having one of their most accurate cycles in recent history, with no significant overestimation of Republican support.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there increased distrust of pollsters among Republican voters, particularly supporters of Donald Trump, as of 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, there is increased distrust of pollsters and the election process among Republican voters, particularly supporters of Donald Trump, as of 2023.\n\nSeveral sources highlight this trend:\n- Republicans are more likely to distrust the election process and poll results, with many believing in unsubstantiated claims of vote fraud and expressing skepticism about the honesty and openness of elections.\n- A significant portion of Trump's supporters trust his campaign more than official election results, indicating a distrust in the traditional polling and election certification processes.\n- Surveys show that Republicans, especially Trump supporters, have lower trust in the election system compared to Democrats, with concerns focused on issues like vote fraud, problems with voting by mail, and the integrity of the electoral process.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout expected to be significantly different in the 2024 U.S. presidential election compared to 2016 and 2020?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether voter turnout in the 2024 U.S. presidential election will be significantly different from that of 2016 and 2020. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources provide historical data on voter turnout for previous elections, such as the 2020 election, which saw a record-high turnout due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- For the 2024 election, early voting data indicates high turnout in some states, but it does not provide a comprehensive comparison to the overall turnout of the 2016 and 2020 elections.\n- There is no specific projection or analysis in the sources that directly compares the expected overall voter turnout for 2024 to that of the previous two elections.\n\nTherefore, the information available is not sufficient to determine if voter turnout in 2024 will be significantly different from 2016 and 2020.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant third-party candidates announced for the 2024 U.S. presidential election as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, there are significant third-party candidates announced for the 2024 U.S. presidential election as of October 2023.\n\nAs of October 2023, several notable third-party and independent candidates had announced their campaigns. These include:\n\n- **Robert F. Kennedy Jr.**: Initially running for the Democratic nomination, he later switched to an independent campaign in October 2023.\n- **Jill Stein**: A physician and environmental activist, she announced her candidacy for the Green Party nomination in November 2023, although her campaign was already underway by this time.\n- **Cornel West**: An academic and activist, he launched his presidential campaign in June 2023 under the People's Party but later switched to running as an independent.\n- **Chase Oliver**: Running under the Libertarian Party, he secured the party's nomination in May 2024, but his campaign was already active by October 2023.\n\nThese candidates represent various third-party and independent movements in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent U.S. election polls since 2020 shown improved accuracy in predicting election outcomes?\nANSWER: The accuracy of U.S. election polls since 2020 has shown some improvements, but it is mixed and depends on the context.\n\n### Improvements in Midterms\nPolling for the 2022 midterms was generally more accurate compared to the presidential elections of 2016 and 2020. According to FiveThirtyEight, the 2022 election polling was \"historically accurate\".\n\n### Continued Challenges in Presidential Elections\nHowever, the accuracy issues observed in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections have not been entirely resolved. The 2020 presidential election polls still had significant errors, particularly at the state level, and overstated Joe Biden's lead over Donald Trump.\n\n### Methodological Adjustments\nPollsters have been working to improve accuracy by adopting new methods, such as weighting surveys based on whom respondents recall voting for in previous elections and adjusting for education levels. These adjustments have contributed to better performance in some elections, like the 2022 midterms.\n\n### Ongoing Issues\nDespite these efforts, polls still face inherent uncertainties and errors beyond just sampling error. The actual margin of error is often larger than reported, and confidence intervals may not capture the true election outcome as frequently as claimed.\n\nIn summary, while there have been improvements, particularly in midterm elections, the accuracy of presidential election polls remains a subject of concern and ongoing improvement.\n\n**YES**, there have been some improvements, especially in midterm elections, but **NO**, the issues are not fully resolved, particularly for presidential elections. Therefore, the answer is somewhat nuanced.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (due to the mixed nature of the improvements)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major polling organizations announced significant methodological changes since the 2020 election to address past polling biases related to underestimating Republican support?\nANSWER: Yes, major polling organizations have announced significant methodological changes since the 2020 election to address past polling biases, including those related to underestimating Republican support.\n\nSeveral sources highlight these changes:\n- After the 2020 election, more than a third (37%) of pollsters changed their methods, which included adjustments in sampling and interviewing techniques. This was more common and complex compared to the changes made after the 2016 election.\n- Pollsters have started weighting their samples by education, which was identified as a key factor in predicting political preferences. They are also paying closer attention to the geographic distribution of respondents and using multiple methods such as text messaging, probability-based panels, and a mix of online and phone surveys to reach a broader segment of the population.\n- There has been a shift away from random-digit dialing to methods like address-based sampling and drawing samples from lists of registered voters to better calibrate the mix of respondents between different political affiliations.\n- The use of multiple methodologies has increased, with some pollsters now using four different methods, including live telephone calls, automated phone calls, online surveys with pre-recruited respondents, and text messaging.\n- Despite these changes, the challenge of accurately capturing Republican support remains, with ongoing issues such as declining response rates and the politicization of polling potentially skewing results.\n\nThese changes reflect ongoing efforts to improve polling accuracy and address the biases that led to underestimating Republican support in previous elections.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have pollsters successfully adjusted their sampling methods to better represent demographic groups that were underrepresented in past polls, such as white non-college-educated voters?\nANSWER: The success of pollsters in adjusting their sampling methods to better represent demographic groups that were underrepresented in past polls, such as white non-college-educated voters, is a complex and ongoing issue.\n\n### Adjustments and Methods\nPollsters have indeed made several adjustments to their methods to improve representation:\n- Many pollsters now use a combination of landline and cellular telephones, as well as other modes like text and online surveys, to increase coverage and representativeness.\n- There has been an increase in the use of probability-based panels and address-based sampling (ABS) to draw more representative samples.\n- Weighting techniques are widely used to ensure that the demographic characteristics of the sample match those of the population, including variables such as age, race, gender, educational attainment, and region.\n\n### Challenges\nDespite these efforts, challenges persist:\n- Low response rates continue to be a problem, which can lead to nonresponse bias and make it difficult to ensure that the sample is truly representative.\n- The shift towards nonprobability samples and online opt-in polls, while sometimes weighted to match demographic benchmarks, does not guarantee the same level of representativeness as random sampling.\n\n### Specific Groups\nRegarding white non-college-educated voters specifically:\n- There is evidence that some polls have understated support for certain candidates among this group in the past, highlighting the need for continued improvement in sampling methods.\n- The use of multiple methods and weighting adjustments aims to mitigate such underrepresentation, but the effectiveness can vary.\n\nGiven these points, while pollsters have made significant efforts to adjust their methods, it is unclear whether these adjustments have fully resolved the issue of underrepresentation for all demographic groups, including white non-college-educated voters.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence, as of 2023, suggesting that the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon continues to affect polling accuracy?\nANSWER: As of 2023, the evidence suggests that the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon is unlikely to be a significant factor affecting polling accuracy. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n1. **Lack of Consistent Evidence**: Studies and analyses have consistently shown little evidence to support the idea that shy Trump voters significantly impact polling accuracy. For example, the AAPOR reports and other scholarly work have downplayed the shy Trump voter hypothesis as a major source of bias.\n\n2. **Alternative Explanations**: Polling errors in past elections are more likely attributed to other factors such as underestimating the size of the Republican base, self-selection bias, or methodological issues rather than shy voters.\n\n3. **Improved Polling Methods**: Modern polling methods, such as weighting surveys on recalled 2020 vote choice, have been implemented to better capture the actual level of support for candidates, reducing the likelihood of shy voters skewing the results.\n\n4. **Experimental Evidence**: Experiments designed to test for social desirability bias, such as the list experiment by Alexander Coppock, found no significant difference in support for Trump when respondents were asked directly versus indirectly, which contradicts the shy Trump voter hypothesis.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence does not strongly support the continuation of the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon as a significant factor in polling accuracy.\n\n**UNCLEAR** is not the correct answer here because the sources provide substantial evidence and analysis that lean towards dismissing the shy Trump voter hypothesis. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately **2 to 3 weeks** left until the outcome is known. Today is **October 22, 2024**, and the U.S. presidential election is scheduled for **November 5, 2024**. Final popular vote counts are typically available within a week after the election, so the complete results should be known by mid-November.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, the RealClearPolitics (RCP) national polling average shows **Donald Trump trailing Kamala Harris by -1.583 percentage points**. Historical polling biases from the 2016 and 2020 elections showed an underestimation of Trump's support by more than **1 percentage point**. Applying a similar bias to the current polls:\n\n- **Polled spread:** -1.583 pp (Trump trailing)\n- **Expected bias based on history:** Approximately **-1.5 pp**\n  \nAssuming the bias remains similar, the actual election results might show Trump trailing by around **0.083 pp** or potentially even leading. The polling bias would then be calculated as:\n\n- **Polling bias:** -1.583 pp (polled spread) minus Actual spread\n\nIf the actual spread is **-0.5 pp** (Trump trailing slightly):\n\n- **Polling bias:** -1.583 pp - (-0.5 pp) = **-1.083 pp**\n\nThis bias of **-1.083 pp** is just outside the specified range (> -1.0 pp and < 0 pp). Therefore, if nothing changed, the outcome would likely be **No**; the polling bias would not fall within the desired range.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only **3-4 days** left until the election, there would be minimal time for significant changes in voter sentiment or polling methodologies. Given the current data and historical trends, I would forecast a **20% probability** that the polling bias will be between **-1.0 pp and 0 pp**.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **8-12 weeks** left until the election, there would be more opportunity for shifts due to campaign events, debates, or emerging news stories. However, considering the persistent challenges in accurately polling Trump supporters and potential nonresponse bias, I might adjust the probability slightly upward to **25%**, accounting for the increased uncertainty over a longer period.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Polling Biases:** In both 2016 and 2020, national polls underestimated Trump's support by more than **1 percentage point**. This suggests a tendency for polls to have a bias outside the specified range.\n\n- **Methodological Adjustments:** While pollsters have implemented methodological changes to address past inaccuracies\u2014such as adjusting for education levels and sampling methods\u2014the effectiveness of these changes remains uncertain, especially in capturing Trump\u2019s support accurately.\n\n- **Nonresponse Bias and Distrust:** There is documented increased distrust of pollsters among Republican voters and Trump supporters. This nonresponse bias could lead to an underestimation of Trump's support, potentially resulting in a polling bias outside the -1.0 pp to 0 pp range.\n\n- **Shy Trump Voter Phenomenon:** Evidence suggests that the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon is not a significant factor affecting polling accuracy. However, other factors like sampling errors and weighting challenges persist.\n\n- **Polling Improvements:** The 2022 midterm polls were relatively accurate, but midterms have different turnout dynamics compared to presidential elections. Thus, improvements in midterm polling may not fully translate to the presidential context.\n\n- **Third-Party Candidates:** The presence of significant third-party candidates could affect vote shares and polling biases, introducing additional uncertainty.\n\nGiven these considerations, the likelihood of the polling bias falling strictly between **-1.0 pp and 0 pp** is relatively low.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**", "probability": 20}
