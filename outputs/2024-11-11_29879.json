    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the new Prime Minister of Iceland belong to the Social Democratic Alliance after the 2024 parliamentary elections?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-11\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve **Yes** if the new prime minister belongs to the Social Democratic Alliance at the time of receiving the mandate to form a government by the President.\n\nIf, for any reason, no one has received the mandate before 1 January 2025 (including that the election is postponed or the coalition talks are ongoing), this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe [2017 parliamentary elections in Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Icelandic_parliamentary_election) resulted in an unusual governing coalition of the left-wing [Left-Green Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-Green_Movement), the centre [Progressive Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Iceland)), and the centre-right [Independence Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Party_(Iceland)). Despite the Independence Party being the largest party in the coalition, the new prime minister was [Katrín Jakobsdóttir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katr%C3%ADn_Jakobsd%C3%B3ttir), the chairperson of the Left-Green Movement.\n\nIn [2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Icelandic_parliamentary_election), the three-party coalition maintained its majority and remained governmend under the lead of Katrín Jakobsdóttir. However, Jakobsdóttir resigned in April 2024 to contest the [presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Icelandic_presidential_election), which she lost. She was succeeded as prime minister by [Bjarni Benediktsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarni_Benediktsson_(born_1970)), the leader of the Independence Party, who had previously been the prime minister in 2017 and who was the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs of the current government.\n\nOn 13 October, Benediktsson [announced](https://apnews.com/article/iceland-snap-election-coalition-government-9d170f37de3228506de93444668c416a) that the government had collapsed due to disputes over foreign policy, asylum seekers, and energy, prompting him to call for new elections and ask President Halla Tómasdóttir the next day to dissolve the Althingi and set the elections for 30 November.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the new Prime Minister of Iceland belonging to the Social Democratic Alliance after the 2024 parliamentary elections, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Political Landscape\n- The current Prime Minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, is from the Independence Party, and he has dissolved the ruling three-party coalition due to internal disagreements. This coalition included the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Greens[3].\n\n## Upcoming Elections\n- Fresh parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place on 30 November 2024, following the dissolution of the current parliament. This provides an opportunity for any party, including the Social Democratic Alliance, to gain significant power or even form a new government[3].\n\n## Historical Context\n- The Social Democratic Alliance has been a significant player in Icelandic politics but has not been part of the current ruling coalition. To predict their chances, one would need to consider their past electoral performance, current popularity, and any recent shifts in public opinion or policy stances that might influence voter decisions.\n\n## Base Rates\n- Historically, the Independence Party and the Progressive Party have been strong contenders in Icelandic politics. However, the Social Democratic Alliance has also held significant power in the past. Understanding the base rates of electoral outcomes and the typical voter behavior in Iceland would be crucial.\n\n## Current Issues\n- The current government has faced challenges such as disagreements on policy issues like asylum seekers and energy efficiency, as well as broader economic and environmental concerns. The Social Democratic Alliance might capitalize on these issues if they present compelling alternatives that resonate with voters[3].\n\nGiven these points, it is not immediately clear whether the new Prime Minister will belong to the Social Democratic Alliance. The outcome will depend on various factors including the campaign strategies of the parties, voter sentiment, and the performance of other political parties in the elections. Therefore, this question cannot be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" without further analysis and forecasting based on the evolving political landscape in Iceland.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Social Democratic Alliance ever held the Prime Minister's office in Iceland in the past?\nANSWER: YES, the Social Democratic Alliance has held the Prime Minister's office in Iceland in the past. Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, a member of the Social Democratic Alliance, served as the Prime Minister of Iceland from 2009 to 2013[2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout expected to be high among demographics that typically support the Social Democratic Alliance in Iceland?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically address the expected voter turnout among demographics that typically support the Social Democratic Alliance in Iceland. They discuss current polling figures, party support, and general election information, but they do not provide data or insights on voter turnout expectations for specific demographic groups.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Social Democratic Alliance currently leading in opinion polls ahead of the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary elections?\nANSWER: No, the Social Democratic Alliance is not currently leading in opinion polls ahead of the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary elections. According to the latest survey, the Social Democratic Alliance is polling at 25%, but this is a decrease from their previous approval rate. The survey indicates that while they are still among the top parties, they are not the only contenders, and other parties like the Centre Party are gaining significant support[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Social Democratic Alliance formed any pre-election alliances with other parties to strengthen their position?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the Social Democratic Alliance in Iceland has formed any pre-election alliances with other parties specifically to strengthen their position in recent elections.\n\nThe Social Democratic Alliance was formed through the merger of several centre-left parties in 2000, but since then, it has not been mentioned as forming new pre-election alliances with other parties[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Social Democratic Alliance significantly increased its support compared to the last parliamentary election?\nANSWER: To determine if the Social Democratic Alliance in Portugal has significantly increased its support compared to the last parliamentary election, we need to look at the specific results and comparisons provided in the sources.\n\nIn the 2022 election, the Social Democratic Party (PSD), which is part of the Democratic Alliance, won 77 seats[4].\n\nIn the 2024 election, the Democratic Alliance (which includes the PSD, CDS-PP, and PPM) won 79 seats[1][4][5].\n\nThis represents an increase of 2 seats from the previous election, which is a modest increase rather than a significant one.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n## NO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent events or scandals weakened the position of the current ruling parties in favor of the Social Democratic Alliance?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, recent events and scandals have indeed weakened the position of the current ruling parties, but there is no mention of the Social Democratic Alliance.\n\nIn Japan, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partner, the Komeito party, are facing significant challenges due to scandals and public dissatisfaction, leading to a projected loss of their majority in the parliament for the first time in 15 years[1].\n\nHowever, there is no mention of the Social Democratic Alliance in the context of these events. Therefore, while the ruling parties' positions have been weakened, it is unclear if this specifically favors the Social Democratic Alliance.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are left-leaning parties projected to win a majority of seats in the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary elections?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether left-leaning parties will win a majority of seats in the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary elections, although there are indications of significant shifts in support.\n\n- The Social Democratic Alliance, a left-leaning party, is polling strongly and is expected to emerge as the largest party, but it is not clear if it will have enough seats to form a majority on its own[4][5].\n- The current government coalition, which includes the Left-Green Movement, is expected to lose its majority, but the exact distribution of seats among all parties is not definitively stated[4][5].\n- There are predictions of a new centrist coalition involving both centre-left and centre-right elements, which suggests that the outcome could be complex and not necessarily a clear majority for left-leaning parties alone[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are other major Icelandic political parties willing to form a coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance after the 2024 elections?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether other major Icelandic political parties are definitively willing to form a coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance after the 2024 elections, although there are indications of potential alliances.\n\n- The sources suggest that the Social Democratic Alliance is likely to emerge as the largest party in the upcoming elections, and there is speculation about potential coalition formations involving this party[3][5].\n- The Centre Party and the Liberal Reform Party are mentioned as potential coalition partners, given their positions as main opposition parties and their potential to propose unified solutions. However, the willingness to form a coalition would depend on the election results and the parties' willingness to cooperate[5].\n- There is no clear statement from the other major parties explicitly confirming their intention to form a coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the leader of the Social Democratic Alliance considered a strong candidate for Prime Minister by the public and media?\nANSWER: The question appears to be confusing, as it mentions the \"Social Democratic Alliance,\" which is a term more commonly associated with the Icelandic political scene, not the Portuguese context discussed in the other sources.\n\nIf we are referring to the Portuguese context and the leader of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) within the Democratic Alliance:\n\n- Luís Montenegro, the leader of the PSD and the Democratic Alliance, is indeed considered a strong candidate for Prime Minister. He has been appointed as the Prime Minister of Portugal since April 2024, indicating significant support and recognition from both the public and the media[2][3].\n\nHowever, if the question is about the Icelandic Social Democratic Alliance:\n\n- There is no indication in the provided sources that the leader of the Icelandic Social Democratic Alliance is currently considered a strong candidate for Prime Minister in the context of recent elections or current political scenarios[4].\n\nGiven the context provided, the most relevant answer is based on the Portuguese scenario.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant public support for the policies advocated by the Social Democratic Alliance in Iceland?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is significant public support for the Social Democratic Alliance in Iceland.\n\n- The Social Democratic Alliance is currently polling at high levels, with figures such as 30.9% in April 2024, 28% in December 2023, 25% in September 2024, and around 22-24% in the most recent surveys[1][2][4].\n- These numbers indicate that the party has the highest level of support among all parties in Iceland, and it would have the largest number of votes if parliamentary elections were held today[1][2][5].\n\nTherefore, the public support for the policies advocated by the Social Democratic Alliance appears to be significant.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of 2024-11-11, there are approximately 50 days left until the resolution deadline on January 1, 2025. The outcome will likely be known sooner if a new Prime Minister is appointed shortly after the elections on November 30, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed from the current political landscape, it is unlikely that the new Prime Minister will belong to the Social Democratic Alliance. While they may gain seats, the likelihood of their leader becoming Prime Minister without significant coalition support is low.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only about 12 days left, and assuming current polling remains stable, I would estimate the probability at **15%**.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately 200 days left until the outcome, allowing more time for political shifts, I would estimate the probability at **25%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Political Standing:** The Social Democratic Alliance has historically been an influential party but has not been the leading party in recent elections. Current polls suggest they have around 22-25% support, which is significant but not dominant.\n\n- **Coalition Dynamics:** Iceland's political system is characterized by coalition governments. Even if the Social Democratic Alliance secures a substantial number of seats, forming a government typically requires partnerships with other parties. The Prime Minister is often from the largest party in the coalition or the one best positioned to command a majority.\n\n- **Potential Coalitions:** Other parties like the Independence Party and the Progressive Party also hold considerable influence. Unless the Social Democratic Alliance can form a coalition where they take the lead, their leader becoming Prime Minister is less probable.\n\n- **Recent Events:** The collapse of the current government and upcoming elections introduce uncertainty. Voter sentiment may shift due to dissatisfaction with the prior coalition's disputes over key issues like foreign policy and asylum seekers.\n\n- **Voter Behavior:** There is no clear indication of a significant surge in public support for the Social Democratic Alliance that would position them ahead of other major parties.\n\n- **Time Factor:** With the election close, substantial changes in public opinion are less likely in a short timeframe. Extended time could allow for noteworthy developments, but historical trends suggest only moderate shifts.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
