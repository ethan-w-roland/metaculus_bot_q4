    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Hawaii voters approve the constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2024, which would repeal the state's ban on same-sex marriage?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-31\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the  Hawaii Remove Legislature Authority to Limit Marriage to Opposite-Sex Couples Amendment is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reporting. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Hawaii Remove Legislature Authority to Limit Marriage to Opposite-Sex Couples Amendment (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Hawaii_Remove_Legislature_Authority_to_Limit_Marriage_to_Opposite-Sex_Couples_Amendment_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Hawaii voters approving the constitutional amendment to repeal the state's authority to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context\n- In 1998, Hawaii voters approved a constitutional amendment giving the legislature the power to restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples, with 69% of voters supporting it.\n- However, since then, significant legal and societal changes have occurred. Hawaii legalized same-sex marriage in 2013 through the Marriage Equality Act, and the U.S. Supreme Court's *Obergefell v. Hodges* decision in 2015 made same-sex marriage a constitutional right nationwide.\n\n## Current Support and Attitudes\n- There is broad support for same-sex marriage among Hawaiians, with 70% now supporting the right for same-sex couples to marry.\n- The Democratic Party of Hawaii, Governor Josh Green, U.S. Representative Jill Tokuda, and various civil rights organizations, including the ACLU, are in favor of the amendment.\n\n## Legislative and Political Support\n- The bill introducing the constitutional amendment received bipartisan support, passing in the House 43-6 and in the Senate 24-1.\n- Notably, State Senator Mike Gabbard, who was a key proponent of the 1998 amendment, has since apologized and voted to repeal it.\n\n## Fiscal and Practical Impact\n- There is no fiscal impact from this amendment, as same-sex marriage is already legally recognized in Hawaii and across the U.S..\n\n## Concerns and Opposition\n- While there is some opposition, it is relatively minimal. No major political, nongovernmental, or religious organizations have taken formal positions against the amendment. The main concerns are from a few individuals who argue it is political bullying by the liberal Democratic majority.\n\n## National Context\n- The current political landscape, including fears about potential reversals of civil rights by a conservative court, has led to increased efforts to solidify marriage equality in state constitutions. Similar amendments are being proposed in California and Colorado.\n\nGiven these points, the likelihood of the amendment passing appears high due to:\n- Broad public support for same-sex marriage.\n- Strong legislative and political backing.\n- Minimal organized opposition.\n- The historical context of significant societal and legal changes since the original amendment was passed.\n\nHowever, the final outcome depends on voter turnout and engagement, as supporters are concerned that some voters might not bother to vote on the constitutional amendment.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Governor of Hawaii publicly endorsed the amendment to repeal the state's ban on same-sex marriage?\nANSWER: Yes, the Governor of Hawaii has publicly endorsed the amendment to repeal the state's ban on same-sex marriage. Democratic Governor Josh Green provided written testimony to the House Committee on Judiciary & Hawaiian Affairs in favor of the measure.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Democratic Party of Hawaii officially endorsed the constitutional amendment to repeal the state's ban on same-sex marriage?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Hawaii has officially endorsed the constitutional amendment to repeal the legislature's authority to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples. This is stated in multiple sources, including the support from Democratic Governor Josh Green and other Democratic officials, as well as the explicit endorsement mentioned in the texts.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant religious groups in Hawaii campaigning against the repeal of the same-sex marriage ban?\nANSWER: While there are mentions of faith-oriented organizations and individuals with opinions on the matter, the sources do not indicate any significant religious groups in Hawaii that are actively campaigning against the repeal of the same-sex marriage ban.\n\nFor example, the Hawaii Family Forum, a faith-based group, is mentioned, but it is noted that they have yet to determine their stance on the constitutional amendment and are currently prioritizing other issues.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the constitutional amendment to repeal the ban on same-sex marriage receive bipartisan support in the Hawaii state legislature?\nANSWER: Yes, the constitutional amendment to repeal the legislature's authority to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples received bipartisan support in the Hawaii state legislature.\n\nAlthough the support was not unanimous, the amendment passed with significant bipartisan backing. In the House, it passed 43-6, with one Democrat and five Republicans voting against it. In the Senate, it passed 24-1, with only one Republican voting against it.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does historical voting behavior in Hawaii show support for progressive social issues like same-sex marriage?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not directly address historical voting behavior in Hawaii specifically in relation to progressive social issues like same-sex marriage.\n\n- The sources focus on the historical context of the Kingdom of Hawaii, the overthrow, and the subsequent sovereignty movement, as well as contemporary political engagement and voter turnout in Hawaii, but they do not mention specific voting behaviors on issues like same-sex marriage.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether historical voting behavior in Hawaii shows support for progressive social issues like same-sex marriage is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have other states successfully repealed similar bans on same-sex marriage through constitutional amendments recently?\nANSWER: Yes, other states have successfully repealed or are in the process of repealing bans on same-sex marriage through constitutional amendments recently.\n\n- In 2020, Nevada became the first state to repeal its constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage through the approval of Question 2.\n- For the 2024 elections, voters in Colorado, California, and Hawaii are deciding on constitutional amendments to remove same-sex marriage bans from their state constitutions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are any major organizations or influential figures in Hawaii actively opposing the amendment to repeal the same-sex marriage ban?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of major organizations or influential figures in Hawaii that are actively opposing the amendment to repeal the legislative authority to limit marriage to opposite-sex couples.\n\n- The sources mention that the bill introducing the constitutional amendment had bipartisan support, although it was not unanimous. However, there are no formal positions or significant opposition from major organizations or influential figures noted.\n\n- In fact, several prominent organizations, including the ACLU of Hawaii, the Hawaii Civil Rights Commission, the Hawaii Health and Harm Reduction Center, and the Hawaii State AFL-CIO, are supporting the amendment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout for constitutional amendments typically high in Hawaii during general elections?\nANSWER: The information available does not indicate that voter turnout for constitutional amendments is typically high in Hawaii. Here are some key points:\n\n- Hawaii requires a majority of the total votes cast in the entire election for a constitutional amendment to pass, which includes counting blank votes as \"no\" votes. This can make it more challenging for amendments to pass, suggesting that voter engagement on these specific issues may not be universally high.\n\n- The system of counting blank votes as \"no\" votes can lead to amendments being defeated even if a significant portion of voters who do cast ballots support the amendment, which implies that voter turnout and active participation on these questions might not always be high.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is unclear whether voter turnout for constitutional amendments is typically high, but the unique voting rules in Hawaii suggest it may not be.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do recent polls show that a majority of Hawaii voters support repealing the ban on same-sex marriage?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nRecent polls and support indicators suggest that a majority of Hawaii voters support repealing the ban on same-sex marriage. Here are some key points:\n\n- Supporters of the amendment, including Democratic Governor Josh Green and U.S. House Representative Jill Tokuda, have noted that societal attitudes have changed dramatically since the original ban was passed, with 70% of Hawaiians now supporting the right for same-sex couples to legally wed.\n\n- The polling numbers mentioned in the context of similar amendments in other states also reflect broad support for same-sex marriage, with 69% of Americans supporting it nationally, which is likely to be reflective of the sentiment in Hawaii as well.\n\n- The lack of formal opposition from major political, nongovernmental, or religious organizations further indicates strong support for the repeal of the ban.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant media coverage and public awareness in Hawaii regarding the amendment to repeal the same-sex marriage ban?\nANSWER: There is notable media coverage and public awareness in Hawaii regarding the amendment to repeal the legislative authority to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples, although the level of public engagement is a subject of discussion.\n\n- Multiple news outlets and sources have covered the amendment extensively, explaining its implications and the reasons behind it. For example, Spectrum News Hawaii, AP News, and Reason Foundation have all provided detailed reports on the amendment.\n\n- There are videos and explanations aimed at clarifying the ballot question for voters, indicating an effort to raise awareness about the issue.\n\n- However, there are concerns about voter apathy and the potential for voters to leave the question blank, which could affect the outcome. Advocates are actively promoting the amendment and urging voters to participate.\n\nOverall, while there is significant media coverage, there is also a recognized need to increase public awareness and engagement to ensure the amendment receives the necessary votes. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n- There are **5 days** remaining until the general election on **November 5, 2024**, when the outcome will be determined.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n- If current trends and conditions persist, the amendment is **likely to be approved** by the voters.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n- With approximately **1 day** left, and less opportunity for unforeseen events, I would slightly **increase** my probability estimate.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n- With **20 days** remaining, allowing more time for potential developments, I would slightly **decrease** my probability estimate.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Public Support:**\n   - Recent polls indicate that **70% of Hawaiians support same-sex marriage**, showcasing a significant shift in societal attitudes since the original 1998 amendment.\n   - Similar amendments in other states have seen success, such as Nevada in 2020, suggesting a favorable trend.\n\n2. **Legislative and Political Backing:**\n   - The amendment received **bipartisan support** in the state legislature, passing the House 43-6 and the Senate 24-1.\n   - Key political figures, including **Governor Josh Green** and the **Democratic Party of Hawaii**, have officially endorsed the amendment.\n\n3. **Minimal Opposition:**\n   - No major political, nongovernmental, or religious organizations are actively opposing the amendment.\n   - The lack of organized opposition reduces the likelihood of significant campaigning against the amendment.\n\n4. **Voter Turnout and Engagement:**\n   - A critical factor is Hawaii's constitutional amendment requirements: an amendment must receive a majority of **all votes cast in the election**, including blank votes counted as \"no\" votes.\n   - Historical data suggests that **voter turnout for constitutional amendments can be low**, and voter apathy may lead to many leaving the question blank.\n   - Advocates are working to increase awareness, but there is still a risk that insufficient voter participation could hinder the amendment's approval.\n\n5. **Media Coverage:**\n   - There is **significant media coverage** and efforts to educate voters about the amendment, which may help mitigate issues with voter awareness and turnout.\n\n6. **Time Frame Considerations:**\n   - With only 5 days left, the window for significant changes in public opinion or opposition mobilization is narrow.\n   - If there were less time left (e.g., 1 day), the probability of unforeseen events impacting the outcome diminishes.\n   - Conversely, with more time (e.g., 20 days), there is a greater opportunity for unexpected developments that could affect voter sentiment.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the strong public support, legislative backing, minimal opposition, and the efforts to increase voter awareness, but also acknowledging the challenges posed by Hawaii's constitutional amendment process and potential voter apathy, I estimate the probability that the amendment will be approved by voters as:\n\n**Probability: 75%**",
