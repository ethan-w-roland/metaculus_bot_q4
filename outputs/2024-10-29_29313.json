    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the same presidential candidate win Michigan and Wisconsin in the 2024 election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the same candidate wins the popular vote in Michigan and Wisconsin in the 2024 presidential election. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Election Forecast Correlations](https://roadtolarissa.com/forecast-correlation/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the same presidential candidate will win Michigan and Wisconsin in the 2024 election, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context and Electoral Behavior\n- Both Michigan and Wisconsin are considered crucial battleground states, particularly in the Midwest. They have a history of being closely contested, with recent elections showing narrow margins between Democratic and Republican candidates. In 2016, Donald Trump won both states narrowly, while in 2020, Joe Biden won them back for the Democrats, also by narrow margins.\n\n## Current Polling\n- As of the latest polls, both states are in a dead heat. In Wisconsin, polls indicate a very close race between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, with margins of less than 1% separating the candidates.\n- In Michigan, similar polling data shows a tight contest, with Trump and Harris essentially tied according to recent averages.\n\n## Partisan Lean and Voter Behavior\n- Wisconsin is described as a \"purple state\" with a nearly even partisan lean, making it highly competitive.\n- Michigan also exhibits similar competitive dynamics, with voters often splitting closely between Democratic and Republican candidates.\n\n## Base Rates and Recent Trends\n- Historically, both states have been swing states, but there is no consistent pattern of them always voting for the same candidate. The outcomes can vary based on the specific candidates and the broader national political climate.\n\n## Time to Resolution\n- The election is imminent, and the final outcome will be determined in the next few days. Polls up until this point suggest a high level of uncertainty.\n\nGiven these points, it is not clear whether the same presidential candidate will win both Michigan and Wisconsin. The races in both states are extremely close, and the historical context suggests that outcomes can vary significantly from one election to another. Therefore, the answer to this question cannot be clearly determined as yes or no based on the current information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the same presidential candidate win both Michigan and Wisconsin in the 2020 U.S. election?\nANSWER: YES, the same presidential candidate, Joe Biden, won both Michigan and Wisconsin in the 2020 U.S. election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are third-party candidates polling above 5% in either Michigan or Wisconsin as of 2024-10-29?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, as of October 29, 2024, third-party candidates are not polling above 5% in either Michigan or Wisconsin.\n\nIn Michigan, the latest polls indicate that third-party candidates such as Jill Stein (Green Party), Cornel West (independent), and Chase Oliver (Libertarian Party) are each receiving 1% or less of the support.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the polls also show that third-party candidates, including Jill Stein and Chase Oliver, are each receiving less than 1% support.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout projected to be significantly different between Michigan and Wisconsin for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear and direct comparison of the projected voter turnout between Michigan and Wisconsin for the 2024 election.\n\n- The sources provide some insights into early voting trends and demographic breakdowns in both states, but they do not offer a direct comparison of the overall projected turnout.\n- While the sources discuss the importance of turnout in both states and the competitive nature of the elections, they do not provide specific projections or comparisons of the turnout rates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Michigan and Wisconsin voted for the same presidential candidate in every election since 1988?\nANSWER: No, Michigan and Wisconsin have not voted for the same presidential candidate in every election since 1988.\n\nIn 1988, Wisconsin voted for Michael Dukakis (Democratic), while Michigan and Pennsylvania voted for George H.W. Bush (Republican).\n\nAdditionally, in the 2016 election, both Michigan and Wisconsin voted for Donald Trump (Republican), but in the 2020 election, both states voted for Joe Biden (Democratic). This indicates that while they have often aligned, there was at least one instance (1988) where they did not vote for the same candidate.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the same presidential candidate win both Michigan and Wisconsin in the 2016 U.S. election?\nANSWER: Yes, the same presidential candidate won both Michigan and Wisconsin in the 2016 U.S. election. Donald Trump won in both states.\n\n- In Wisconsin, Trump won with 47.22% of the total votes, defeating Hillary Clinton who received 46.45% of the votes.\n- In Michigan, Trump also won, receiving 47.3% of the votes and 10,704 more votes than Hillary Clinton, who received 47.0% of the votes.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of 2024-10-29, is one presidential candidate leading in the polls in both Michigan and Wisconsin?\nANSWER: As of October 29, 2024, the polling data indicates the following:\n\n- In Wisconsin, the latest poll shows that Harris and Trump are in a dead heat, meaning neither candidate is leading significantly.\n- In Michigan, recent polls indicate that Trump has erased Harris' lead, but it does not clearly state that Trump is leading; rather, it suggests the race is closely contested.\n\nGiven this information, it is unclear if one presidential candidate is leading in the polls in both Michigan and Wisconsin, as the races in both states appear to be very close.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major events unique to Wisconsin that could significantly alter voter preferences in the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Several factors and events unique to Wisconsin could potentially influence voter preferences in the 2024 election:\n\n## Campaign Visits and Rallies\nBoth major candidates, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, have made significant campaign stops in Wisconsin. Trump returned to Wisconsin multiple times, including a visit to Waukesha and a town hall with former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, while Harris held her first top-of-the-ticket campaign rally in Milwaukee and later visited other parts of the state.\n\n## Primary Elections and Candidate Selection\nWisconsin held partisan primary elections on August 13, which included contests for the U.S. Senate, U.S. House districts, and state legislature seats. These primaries could shape the political landscape and influence voter preferences as candidates were selected for the general election.\n\n## Constitutional Amendments\nThere are two constitutional amendments on the ballot in Wisconsin that seek to limit the governor’s power to spend federal money. These amendments, backed by Republicans and opposed by Democrats, could be a significant issue for voters and may influence their preferences based on their stance on gubernatorial powers.\n\n## Economic and Social Issues\nIssues such as abortion, student loan debt relief, and the economy are prominent in Wisconsin. The Biden administration's efforts to protect abortion access and forgive student loan debt, as well as Trump's stance on these issues, are likely to impact voter decisions.\n\n## Legal and Political Controversies\nTrump's conviction on criminal charges and the subsequent sentencing schedule, as well as the controversy surrounding his campaign promises and policies (e.g., immigration and climate change), could also sway voter preferences in Wisconsin.\n\nThese events and issues highlight the complex and contentious nature of the 2024 election in Wisconsin, which is a crucial swing state. They have the potential to significantly alter voter preferences as voters weigh the various candidates' positions and recent developments.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major events unique to Michigan that could significantly alter voter preferences in the 2024 election?\nANSWER: There have been several events and factors unique to Michigan that could potentially influence voter preferences in the 2024 election:\n\n## Protests and Controversies\n- During a Detroit-area airport rally, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, was interrupted by protesters opposed to Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. This incident, given the significant Arab American population in Michigan, particularly in areas like Dearborn, could impact voter sentiment.\n\n## Voter Demographics and Issues\n- Michigan's Arab American population is a crucial voting bloc, and their discontent with the Democratic administration's approach to the Israel-Hamas conflict could influence their voting decisions.\n\n## Endorsements and Local Support\n- Despite the protests, Harris won the endorsement of Assad Turfe, the deputy county executive and highest-ranking Arab American official of Wayne County, which might help mitigate some of the negative impact.\n\n## Young Voters and Midterm Turnout\n- Strong turnout by young voters in the 2022 midterms, who are expected to continue supporting Democrats, is another factor. However, their displeasure over issues like the handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict and a potential ban of the popular TikTok app could also affect their voting behavior.\n\n## Independent Voters\n- Independents, who helped Trump win in 2016 and Biden in 2020, remain a critical group in Michigan. Their preferences could significantly alter the election outcome.\n\nThese factors, particularly the local reactions to national and international issues, could significantly influence voter preferences in Michigan during the 2024 election.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of 2024-10-29, are the polling margins between the leading candidates within 2% in both Michigan and Wisconsin?\nANSWER: As of October 29, 2024, here are the polling margins for Michigan and Wisconsin based on the available sources:\n\n## Michigan\n- According to the Quinnipiac University poll released on October 23, Kamala Harris receives 49% support, and Donald Trump receives 46% support, which is a margin of 3 percentage points.\n\n## Wisconsin\n- The same Quinnipiac University poll released on October 23 indicates that the presidential race in Wisconsin is tied, with both Harris and Trump receiving 48% support, which means the margin is 0 percentage points.\n\nGiven this information, the polling margins are within 2% in Wisconsin but not within 2% in Michigan.\n\n**YES** for Wisconsin, **NO** for Michigan.\n\nHowever, since the question asks about both states, the overall answer would be:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any ongoing legal disputes or voting restrictions in either Michigan or Wisconsin that could impact the election outcome differently?\nANSWER: Yes, there are ongoing legal disputes and potential voting issues in both Michigan and Wisconsin that could impact the election outcome differently.\n\n### Michigan\n- There are several lawsuits and challenges in Michigan:\n  - Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is seeking to be removed from the Michigan ballot, arguing that his continued presence violates his First Amendment rights. However, the federal appeals court has been split on entertaining his claims, with one judge labeling his claim as \"completely fraudulent\".\n  - The Michigan Democratic Party initiated a lawsuit questioning the inclusion of Dr. Cornel West and Dr. Melina Abdullah on the Michigan ballot, citing procedural concerns. The West/Abdullah campaign is actively contesting these accusations.\n  - Republicans filed lawsuits challenging the implementation of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA), which were rejected by state court judges. The RNC is appealing one of these decisions.\n  - There is also a lawsuit alleging that Michigan failed to maintain accurate voter rolls, which was dismissed on technical grounds.\n\n### Wisconsin\n- Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also seeking to be removed from the Wisconsin ballot, arguing that his continued presence on the ballot infringes upon his First Amendment rights. The Wisconsin state court has dismissed his request, and he is now appealing to the Supreme Court.\n- Voting has already commenced in Wisconsin, and Kennedy is requesting that a sticker be affixed over his name on the ballot, referencing state law that permits such action in the event of a candidate’s death.\n\nThese ongoing legal disputes and challenges could potentially create turmoil and impact the election outcome in these battleground states.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time Left Until the Outcome is Known:**\n\nAs of October 29, 2024, there are 7 days until the U.S. presidential election on November 5, 2024. Typically, preliminary results for states like Michigan and Wisconsin are reported on election night or within the following day. Therefore, the outcome of this question should be known in approximately 8 to 9 days.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the Outcome Would Be If Nothing Changed:**\n\nIf current conditions persist without significant changes, it is likely that the same presidential candidate will win both Michigan and Wisconsin. Given the tightly contested races and historical patterns of voting, the states are poised to align in their choice.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast with One-Quarter of the Time Left:**\n\nWith only about 2 days remaining until the election, there would be less opportunity for new events to significantly alter voter preferences. In this scenario, I would forecast a higher probability—around **80%**—that the same candidate will win both states.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast with Four Times the Time Left:**\n\nWith approximately 28 days until the election, there's more time for events that could impact voter preferences differently in each state. This increased uncertainty would lead me to forecast a slightly lower probability—around **65%**—that the same candidate will win both states.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**Historical Voting Patterns:**\n\n- **Consistency Between States:** Historically, Michigan and Wisconsin have often voted for the same presidential candidate. Since 1988, they have aligned in every election except in 1988 itself. In both 2016 and 2020, they voted for the same candidate (Trump in 2016, Biden in 2020).\n  \n- **Swing State Dynamics:** Both states are considered swing states with narrow margins of victory, making them highly competitive but also prone to follow similar electoral trends due to regional similarities.\n\n**Current Polling Data:**\n\n- **Close Races:** Recent polling indicates that both states are experiencing extremely tight races. Margins between the candidates are within the margin of error, suggesting that either candidate could win in both states.\n  \n- **Polling Margins:** In Wisconsin, polls show a dead heat, while in Michigan, the lead is within 3 percentage points—a close enough margin to consider the races effectively tied.\n\n**Shared Regional Issues:**\n\n- **Economy and Jobs:** Both states have economies significantly influenced by manufacturing and agriculture. Issues like trade policies, job creation, and economic growth are central and tend to sway voters in similar ways.\n  \n- **Demographic Similarities:** The demographic compositions of Michigan and Wisconsin share similarities, including urban-rural divides and significant populations of working-class voters.\n\n**Potential Diverging Factors:**\n\n- **Michigan-Specific Events:** Protests in Michigan, particularly within the Arab American community over international issues like the Israel-Hamas conflict, could impact voter turnout or preference differently than in Wisconsin.\n  \n- **Wisconsin Political Climate:** Wisconsin has its own unique political dynamics, such as recent state legislative actions and local issues, but no major events suggest a significant divergence from Michigan at this time.\n\n**Time Frame Considerations:**\n\n- **Short Time Frame (Quarter Time):** With limited time left, major shifts in voter sentiment are less likely. The current trends are more likely to hold, increasing the probability that both states will vote the same way.\n  \n- **Extended Time Frame (Four Times the Time):** More time allows for unforeseen events (e.g., political scandals, economic shifts, significant campaign developments) that could independently affect voter preferences in each state, introducing greater uncertainty.\n\n**Base Rates and Statistical Correlation:**\n\n- **Historical Correlation:** Given their past voting alignment and the statistical tendency for these states to move together, the base rate for them voting the same way is high.\n  \n- **Election Forecast Correlations:** Data from past elections show a strong correlation in voting outcomes between Michigan and Wisconsin, supporting a higher probability estimate.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nConsidering the tight races, historical tendencies, current polling, and shared regional issues, it is more likely than not that the same presidential candidate will win both Michigan and Wisconsin in the 2024 election.\n\n---\n\n**Probability:  seventy percent (70%)**",
