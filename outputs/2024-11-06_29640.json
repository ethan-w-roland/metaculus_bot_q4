    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore December 31, 2024, will Tech Crunch report new layoffs at Microsoft?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to Tech Crunch's tracker \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs,\" which can be accessed [here](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/11/tech-layoffs-2024-list/), Microsoft has layoffs following the launch of this question and before October 1, 2024. To resolve the question, a Metaculus Admin will go to the Tech Crunch link on December 31, 2024 and see if Microsoft appears for October 2024, November 2024, or December 2024. If Microsoft is not listed, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nTech Crunch's \"comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" will be the sole source used for resolution of this question, regardless of information from other sources. If a layoff event appears in the time period listed, this question resolves as Yes, and if not, it resolves as No. \n\nAccording to Tech Crunch, \"\"Below youâ€™ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2024, to be updated regularly.\"\" Admins to resolve this question will only be looking to see what is on the page at the time of resolution. If Tech Crunch ceases to publish updates on the resolution source following the launch of this question (regardless of what can be found elsewhere on the Tech Crunch website), this question resolves as **No**. \"\n\nFor ease of resolution, in this series of questions, in order to count the Tech Crunch page must specifically list the company in question, which in this case is Microsoft. This is true regardless of subsidiaries or ownerships. So for example, a question on Microsoft must specifically mention Microsoft, and a layoff event at LinkedIn will not count for purposes of this question (unless the subheading mentions Microsoft), even though LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nDespite its financial health, as a large organizations with its hands in many pies, Microsoft frequently engages in layoffs, most recently in September 2024. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of TechCrunch reporting new layoffs at Microsoft before December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Historical Layoffs\nMicrosoft has already announced several rounds of layoffs in 2024, particularly in its gaming division. In January 2024, Microsoft laid off around 1,900 employees following its acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Additionally, in September 2024, Microsoft announced another layoff of 650 employees in its gaming business.\n\n## Ongoing Trends\nThe tech industry has been experiencing a significant wave of layoffs in 2024, driven by factors such as economic conditions, overhiring during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increasing use of artificial intelligence.\n\n## Company Practices\nMicrosoft, like other tech companies, has been adjusting its workforce to align with its long-term strategic goals and to manage its business efficiently. Given the recent history of layoffs and the ongoing industry trends, it is plausible that Microsoft might continue to make adjustments to its workforce.\n\n## Reporting by TechCrunch\nTechCrunch has been actively reporting on layoffs across the tech industry, including those at Microsoft. Given their track record, if Microsoft were to announce new layoffs, it is likely that TechCrunch would report on them.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is impossible to predict with certainty, the historical context, ongoing industry trends, and the proactive reporting by TechCrunch suggest that there is a reasonable likelihood of new layoffs being reported at Microsoft before December 31, 2024. However, this cannot be confirmed as a definitive yes or no without further specific information.\n\n### Relevant Details for Superforecasters\n- **Base Rates**: The frequency of layoffs in the tech industry, particularly at Microsoft, has been high in 2024.\n- **Time to Resolution**: Layoffs can be announced at any time, but the trend suggests a continued need for workforce adjustments.\n- **Current State of the World**: Economic conditions and the rise of AI continue to influence workforce decisions.\n- **Reference Classes**: Other tech companies are also undergoing significant layoffs, indicating a broader industry trend.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Microsoft announced any layoffs since September 2024?\nANSWER: YES, Microsoft has announced layoffs since September 2024. On September 12, 2024, Microsoft announced the layoff of approximately 650 employees from its gaming division, primarily affecting corporate and support roles, following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Microsoft historically announce layoffs in the last quarter of the year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear historical pattern indicating that Microsoft consistently announces layoffs in the last quarter of the year. The recent layoffs mentioned in the sources are specifically tied to the acquisition of Activision Blizzard and the subsequent restructuring efforts, rather than a recurring annual pattern.\n\n- The layoffs mentioned in the sources occurred in January 2024 and September 2024, which do not fall within the last quarter of the year exclusively.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Microsoft experiencing financial difficulties as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Microsoft is experiencing financial difficulties as of November 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources discuss a significant outage in July 2024 caused by a CrowdStrike software update, which had substantial financial implications for various sectors, but not specifically for Microsoft's financial health.\n- The financial data provided by Microsoft's investor relations does not indicate any financial difficulties; it shows revenue and operating income figures without any mention of financial struggles.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, there is no evidence to suggest that Microsoft is experiencing financial difficulties.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are industry analysts predicting layoffs at Microsoft before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nIndustry analysts and recent reports indicate that Microsoft has already implemented layoffs in 2024, and there are specific mentions of layoffs that will continue or have been announced to occur before the end of the year.\n\n- Microsoft started its fiscal year 2025 with layoffs, affecting various areas including subsidiaries Nuance and Flip, and its AI business.\n- An additional layoff of 650 employees from Microsoft's gaming business was announced in September 2024.\n\nThese layoffs are part of the ongoing adjustments and restructuring within Microsoft, indicating that layoffs have been and may continue to be a part of their strategy before December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is TechCrunch still actively updating its \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it appears that TechCrunch is still actively reporting on and updating information about tech layoffs in 2024.\n\n- The articles from TechCrunch dated October 30, 2024, and November 5, 2024, indicate ongoing coverage of layoffs at companies such as Dropbox and Mozilla Foundation.\n- The InformationWeek article, which references TechCrunch, also suggests that there is continuous reporting and updating on tech layoffs, including recent announcements in October 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Microsoft announced any hiring freezes or cost-cutting measures in Q4 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is evidence suggesting that Microsoft has implemented certain cost-cutting measures and hiring restrictions, although the term \"hiring freeze\" might be somewhat misleading.\n\n- Microsoft has announced layoffs, including 1,900 employees in its gaming division and 1,500 employees in its Azure cloud unit, which indicates cost-cutting measures.\n- There are reports of a hiring freeze, but it is clarified that this does not mean a complete halt on hiring. Instead, it implies that only critical roles will be filled, and other positions will be paused or require more scrutiny for approval.\n\nTherefore, while there is no absolute hiring freeze, there are indeed stricter hiring practices and cost-cutting measures in place.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been significant negative news about Microsoft's business performance in recent months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there has been no significant negative news about Microsoft's business performance in recent months. Here are the key points:\n\n- Microsoft reported strong revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2024, with overall revenue increasing by 17% in Q3 and 15% in Q4 compared to the corresponding periods of the previous fiscal year.\n- The company saw significant growth in various segments, including Microsoft Cloud, Office 365 Commercial, Azure, and Xbox content and services.\n- While there were some declines, such as in Devices revenue, these were offset by strong performance in other areas.\n- The overall financial metrics, including operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, showed positive growth.\n\nTherefore, the recent financial reports indicate positive performance rather than significant negative news.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Microsoft recently undertaken restructuring that could lead to layoffs?\nANSWER: YES\n\nMicrosoft has recently undertaken several rounds of restructuring that have led to layoffs. Here are some key points:\n\n- In September 2024, Microsoft laid off 650 employees from its gaming business, which is part of a larger reduction of 2,550 employees in the gaming division since the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n- In July 2024, Microsoft conducted another round of layoffs affecting various teams and locations, including roles in product and program management.\n- Earlier in 2024, Microsoft cut around 1,000 jobs across the company, including areas such as the Azure cloud unit and the HoloLens mixed-reality organization.\n- In January 2024, Microsoft laid off nearly 2,000 employees in its gaming unit following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are other major tech companies announcing layoffs in October or November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, other major tech companies have announced layoffs in October 2024, and there are indications of ongoing restructuring that could extend into November.\n\n- In October, companies like Dropbox laid off 528 employees (20% of its workforce).\n- dYdX cut 35% of its workforce in October.\n- Coursera laid off 150 people (10% of its workforce) in October.\n- Meta initiated layoffs across various departments, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Reality Labs, in October.\n- Kraken reduced its staff by 15% (approximately 400 jobs) in October.\n- TikTok also cut hundreds of jobs globally in October, primarily in Malaysia.\n\nWhile the sources do not provide specific details on layoffs announced in November 2024, the trend of layoffs and restructuring continues, suggesting that other companies may also be making similar announcements. However, the available information does not include specific November layoffs, so it is unclear if new announcements have been made in that month. Therefore, the answer is based on the October data:\n\nYES, other major tech companies announced layoffs in October 2024. For November, it is UNCLEAR based on the provided sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any economic indicators suggesting a downturn in the tech industry in late 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several economic indicators and factors suggesting a potential downturn or continued challenges in the tech industry in late 2024:\n\n## High Inflation and Interest Rates\nThe US Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes to curb high inflation have increased the cost of borrowing and servicing debt, forcing tech companies to scale back on growth investments and hiring, leading to significant layoffs.\n\n## Economic Downturn and Recession Fears\nThe U.S. economy is showing signs of a slowdown, with recession fears fueled by government debt concerns, geopolitical tensions, and the lingering effects of the pandemic. These factors have prompted tech companies to tighten their belts and implement cost-cutting measures, including layoffs.\n\n## Softening Consumer Spending and Lower Product Demand\nHigh inflation, elevated interest rates, and macroeconomic uncertainties have led to a softening of consumer spending and lower product demand, contributing to workforce reductions in the tech sector.\n\n## Layoff Trends\nThe tech industry has seen a significant wave of layoffs in 2024, with over 124,000 workers losing their jobs across various companies. This trend is an extension of the layoffs seen in 2022 and 2023, indicating ongoing challenges in the sector.\n\n## Macroeconomic Uncertainty\nThe job market is cooling in a pattern that precedes recessions, with private-sector hiring slowing down and the three-month moving average of job gains dropping below 100,000, a pace typically seen around recessions.\n\n## Impact of AI and Automation\nWhile AI promises growth and productivity, it also poses risks to jobs that could be replaced by automation, further contributing to the uncertainty and layoffs in the tech industry.\n\nThese indicators collectively suggest that the tech industry is facing significant economic challenges and uncertainties in late 2024.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately **55 days** left until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changes between now and December 31, 2024, and no new layoffs at Microsoft are reported by TechCrunch in their \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" for October, November, or December 2024, the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only about **14 days** left, the likelihood of new layoffs being announced and reported decreases. I would forecast a probability of around **15%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4Ã— the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **220 days** remaining, extending beyond the current deadline, there would be more time for potential layoffs to occur. I would forecast a higher probability of about **35%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of **November 6, 2024**, Microsoft has conducted several rounds of layoffs earlier in the year, notably in January, July, and **September 2024**, primarily linked to the acquisition of Activision Blizzard and restructuring within its gaming division. There have been no announcements of layoffs since September, and there is no clear historical pattern of Microsoft announcing layoffs specifically in the last quarter of the year.\n\nMicrosoft is currently **not experiencing financial difficulties**; recent financial reports show strong revenue growth and positive performance across various segments. Moreover, there have been no significant negative news reports about Microsoft's business performance in recent months. While there are cost-cutting measures and stricter hiring practices in place, these do not necessarily indicate imminent layoffs.\n\nHowever, the broader tech industry is experiencing a wave of layoffs, with other major companies like Dropbox, Meta, and TikTok announcing layoffs in **October 2024**. Economic indicators suggest potential challenges ahead, including high inflation, interest rate hikes, and recession fears that could impact the tech sector.\n\n**Factors Increasing Probability:**\n\n- **Industry Trends:** The ongoing trend of layoffs in the tech industry could put pressure on Microsoft to adjust its workforce.\n- **Economic Indicators:** Macroeconomic uncertainties and potential economic downturns may prompt further cost-cutting measures.\n\n**Factors Decreasing Probability:**\n\n- **Time Constraint:** With only 55 days left, the window for announcing and reporting new layoffs is limited.\n- **Recent Layoffs Completed:** Microsoft has already conducted significant layoffs in 2024, potentially reducing the need for additional cuts this year.\n- **Financial Health:** Microsoft's strong financial performance lessens the immediate need for further layoffs.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is a possibility that Microsoft may announce new layoffs before December 31, 2024, the probability is moderate due to the limited time remaining and the lack of current indicators suggesting imminent layoffs.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
