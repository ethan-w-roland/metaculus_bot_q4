    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the XEC COVID-19 variant account for at least 50% of the variants monitored in the US before January 5, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if CDC's [variant proportions page](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions) shows a weighted estimate for all XEC variants in the United States of 50% or more of the variants sequence in any period ending before January 5, 2025. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves according to the \"Weighted\" estimate and will not use the \"Nowcast\" estimate.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAnother new COVID variant is rapidly [growing](https://www.goerie.com/story/news/2024/10/22/what-is-covid-19-variant-xec-spreading-in-pennsylvania/75794702007/) in the United States, the XEC variant, which is estimated at 10.7% of sequenced variants for the two-week period ending October 12, 2024, according to the CDC's [variant proportions Nowcast](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions). This this is a sharp increase from the previous two-week period when it was 2.3%, though still a distant second to KP.3.1.1, a [descendant](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/3-things-to-know-about-xec-the-latest-covid-strain) of the FLiRT variants, which is at 57.2% according to the Nowcast (41.2% as of the latest weighted estimate). Results from [one recent study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.16.618773v1) \"suggest that XEC has the potential to outcompete the other major lineage including KP.3.1.1.\"\n\nAt the time of this question, CDC estimates variant proportions using two-week periods, using two different calculations: weighted estimates and Nowcast estimates. According [to CDC](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions):\n\n>Weighted estimates (provided for all two-week periods except the most recent two, two-week periods) are variant proportions that are based on empirical (observed) genomic sequencing data. These estimates are not available for the most recent two-week periods because of the time it takes to generate the sequencing data, including sample collection, specimen treatment, shipping, analysis, and upload into public databases.\n\n>Lineages with weighted estimates less than 1% of all circulating variants are combined with their parent lineage. When the weighted estimate of a lineage crosses the 1% threshold and has substitutions in the spike protein that could affect vaccine efficacy, transmission, or severity, it may be separated from its parent lineage and displayed on its own in the variant proportions data.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n>Nowcast estimates (provided for the most recent two two-week periods when the \"Nowcast on\" option is selected below) are model-based projections of variant proportions for the most recent two-week periods to enable timely public health action. CDC uses the Nowcast to forecast variant proportions before the weighted estimates are available for a given two-week period.\n\nDue to the greater reliability,  verifiability, and empirical basis of the Weighted estimate, this question resolves based on that figure.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the XEC COVID-19 variant accounting for at least 50% of the variants monitored in the US before January 5, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Prevalence\nAs of late September and early October 2024, XEC represented a significant but minority portion of COVID-19 cases in the US. It was estimated to be responsible for around 10.7% to 14-22% of COVID infections in the country.\n\n## Growth Trend\nXEC has been observed to have a growth advantage over other circulating variants, spreading rapidly in Europe, North America, and Asia. It has been noted for its strong growth, particularly in Germany and other parts of Europe.\n\n## Comparative Growth\nWhile KP.3.1.1 is currently the dominant variant in the US, representing 54-60% of viruses nationally, the growth of XEC has been increasing. However, the rate at which XEC is gaining ground needs to be significantly accelerated to reach 50% prevalence by January 5, 2025.\n\n## Seasonal Factors\nThe upcoming winter season is known to facilitate the spread of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19. This could potentially enhance the spread of XEC, but it is uncertain whether this will be enough to push XEC to over 50% prevalence in such a short timeframe.\n\n## Vaccine Effectiveness\nThe updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccines are expected to provide protection against XEC, although the exact efficacy is not guaranteed due to the virus's constant mutations. This could influence the spread of XEC, but it is unlikely to halt it completely.\n\nGiven these points, while XEC is growing rapidly and has a growth advantage, it is still uncertain whether it will reach 50% prevalence by January 5, 2025. The current data suggests it is increasing, but the scale and speed of this increase are critical factors that will determine if it reaches this threshold.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historical data on COVID-19 variants shows that new variants can rise quickly, but reaching dominance often takes several months.\n- The current dominant variant, KP.3.1.1, still holds a significant majority, which XEC would need to overcome.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The timeframe until January 5, 2025, is relatively short, and significant changes in variant prevalence can occur, but reaching 50% in this period would require a rapid and sustained increase in XEC cases.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The ongoing monitoring and genomic surveillance by health authorities will continue to provide insights into the spread and prevalence of XEC.\n\nIn summary, while XEC is on the rise and has the potential to become a dominant strain, it is not clear based on current data whether it will account for at least 50% of the variants monitored in the US by January 5, 2025. The answer to this question remains uncertain and will depend on various factors including the rate of spread, seasonal influences, and the effectiveness of current vaccines.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the World Health Organization classified the XEC variant as a variant of concern or variant of interest?\nANSWER: The World Health Organization (WHO) has not classified the XEC variant as a variant of concern (VOC) or a variant of interest (VOI). Instead, it has been classified as a \"variant under monitoring\" (VUM) due to its mutations and early signs of a growth advantage compared to other circulating variants.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any COVID-19 variant previously increased from around 10% to over 50% prevalence in the US within a two-month period?\nANSWER: Yes, a COVID-19 variant has previously increased from around 10% to over 50% prevalence in the US within a two-month period.\n\nThe Delta variant, for example, demonstrated this rapid growth. In the US, the Delta variant grew to dominance in approximately 10 weeks (around 2-3 months) after its first detection. Specifically, in England and several US states, Delta transitioned from less than 5% to over 50% of cases between May and June 2021, and in some US states, it reached dominance in about 10 weeks.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the XEC variant currently increasing in prevalence in the United States according to the latest CDC weighted estimates?\nANSWER: Yes, the XEC variant is currently increasing in prevalence in the United States. According to the latest information, by the end of September, XEC was responsible for about 5.7% to 10.7% of COVID infections in the U.S., and it has been detected in at least 25 states.\n\nThis indicates a steady rise in the prevalence of the XEC variant, although it still lags behind the dominant KP.3.1.1 variant.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the XEC variant become the dominant COVID-19 strain in any other country before November 2024?\nANSWER: As of the information available up to November 2024, there is no indication that the XEC variant has become the dominant COVID-19 strain in any country. While XEC has been spreading rapidly and has a growth advantage over other variants, it still constitutes a minority of cases in the regions where it has been detected.\n\nFor example, in Europe, XEC made up about 8% of all sequenced and reported samples by the end of September, with the most commonly sequenced variant still being KP.3.1.1 at 48%.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the KP.3.1.1 variant currently showing a declining trend in weighted prevalence in the United States?\nANSWER: Based on the latest available data, the KP.3.1.1 variant is not showing a declining trend in weighted prevalence as of the sources provided.\n\n- As of September 28, the KP.3.1.1 variant accounted for more than 59% of all U.S. COVID-19 cases, indicating it was the dominant variant at that time.\n- There is no indication in the sources that the prevalence of KP.3.1.1 has started to decline; instead, it has been rising and remains dominant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the CDC's genomic surveillance capable of detecting rapid changes in variant proportions in time for the January 5, 2025 cutoff?\nANSWER: Yes, the CDC's genomic surveillance is capable of detecting rapid changes in variant proportions in a timely manner, which would be sufficient for the January 5, 2025 cutoff.\n\n- The CDC updates variant proportion estimates every 2 weeks on the COVID Data Tracker, indicating a regular and frequent monitoring of variant changes.\n- The genomic surveillance program integrates data from various sources, including the National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3) program, commercial laboratories, and public repositories, allowing for comprehensive and ongoing monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n- This continuous surveillance enables the CDC to identify emerging variants and guide vaccine and therapeutic development and use in a timely fashion.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current COVID-19 vaccines less effective against the XEC variant compared to other variants?\nANSWER: The current COVID-19 vaccines are expected to provide some protection against the XEC variant, but they may be less effective compared to other variants.\n\n- Experts indicate that while the vaccines will still offer protection, the efficacy might be slightly reduced due to the recombinant nature of XEC. For example, Scott Roberts from Yale Medicine notes that the new vaccine will likely still be effective but will have diminished protection against XEC.\n- The vaccines are designed to target strains like KP.2 and JN.1, which are related to XEC, but the match is not perfect. This suggests that while there will be some degree of protection, it may not be as strong as against other variants.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the winter season expected to contribute to a significant increase in COVID-19 transmission in the United States?\nANSWER: Yes, the winter season is expected to contribute to a significant increase in COVID-19 transmission in the United States.\n\nSeveral factors support this conclusion:\n- Winter conditions, such as colder and drier air, can enhance the survival and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Dry air interferes with the body's ability to clear viruses from the upper respiratory tract, and colder temperatures allow the virus to survive longer.\n- Behavioral patterns during winter, including spending more time indoors with less ventilation, holiday gatherings, and travel, increase the opportunities for the virus to spread.\n- Historical data show that COVID-19 cases tend to peak during the winter months, although the virus can surge at other times of the year as well due to new variants and waning immunity.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the XEC variant have mutations that significantly increase its transmissibility compared to other circulating variants like KP.3.1.1?\nANSWER: The evidence suggests that the XEC variant does have characteristics that could enhance its transmissibility, although the extent of this increase is still being studied.\n\n- The XEC variant is a recombinant of the KS.1.1 and KP.3.3 variants, and it possesses specific mutations in the spike protein, such as S:F59S, which could contribute to its increased infectivity.\n- Research from the Sato Lab indicates that XEC has a higher reproduction number compared to KP.3.1.1, suggesting it may spread more easily.\n- Experts note that XEC is spreading rapidly and has a growth advantage over other circulating variants, which implies it may be more transmissible.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while these mutations and characteristics suggest increased transmissibility, the exact degree to which XEC surpasses other variants in spread is still under investigation and not fully quantified.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **YES**, the XEC variant has mutations that could significantly increase its transmissibility compared to other circulating variants like KP.3.1.1.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any public health measures or interventions in place that could significantly impact the spread of the XEC variant in the US?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several public health measures and interventions in place or recommended to impact the spread of the XEC variant in the US:\n\n## Vaccination\n- The CDC recommends the updated 2024-2025 COVID-19 vaccines, which are designed to target the KP.2 variant but are expected to provide substantial protection against the XEC variant as well.\n\n## Testing and Isolation\n- Current COVID-19 tests are effective in detecting the XEC variant. Individuals are advised to test if they exhibit symptoms or have had exposure, and to test before attending large gatherings, especially if high-risk individuals will be present.\n\n## General Precautions\n- Public health officials recommend taking usual precautions to avoid COVID infection, such as staying away from people who are sick, wearing masks in crowded indoor spaces, and following other CDC recommendations.\n\n## Antiviral Treatments\n- Antivirals like Paxlovid remain effective and are recommended, especially for those at high risk of severe disease. These treatments are most beneficial when administered within the first few days of symptom onset.\n\n## Monitoring and Tracking\n- The CDC and other health agencies are closely monitoring the spread of the XEC variant, tracking its prevalence, and updating guidelines as necessary to manage its impact.\n\nThese measures are intended to reduce the spread and severity of the XEC variant, particularly among high-risk populations.",
