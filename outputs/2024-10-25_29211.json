{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Donald Trump sell any shares of Trump Media before January 1, 2025, as revealed by a Form 4 filing?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on January 1, 2025, there is a Form 4 posted at [this](https://ir.tmtgcorp.com/financials/sec-filings/) SEC filings page for Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., dated after the launch of this question, revealing that former President Donald Trump has made any disposals of his derivative securities in the company. If there is no such Form 4 filing on that page, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. Please note for example that the resolution link is not the SEC EDGAR database, so forecasters who believe there is a material chance that Trump Media's investor relations page will not be timely updated should forecast accordingly.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTrump Media & Technology Group owns Truth Social, and Former President Donald Trump currently owns 36 million shares of the company, according to the most recent [Form 4 filing](https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001474506-24-000146.htm) with his name on it. According to the New York Times, Trump's 6 month lockup period is [scheduled to end](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/business/trump-media-stock-truth-social.html) on Thursday, September 19, 2024. According to Seeking Alpha, Trump [told a reporter](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4149683-trump-media-jumps-25-as-former-president-suggests-he-wont-sell-shares) at a press conference that he was not prepared to start selling shares, causing the stock price to jump in reaction to that statement.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Donald Trump will sell any shares of Trump Media before January 1, 2025, and whether this would be revealed by a Form 4 filing, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Lock-Up Agreement\nThe lock-up agreement that prevented Donald Trump and other insiders from selling their shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) was set to expire around September 19, 2024. This means that Trump has been eligible to sell his shares since then, provided the stock price does not dip below $12.\n\n## Trump's Stated Intentions\nAs of recent statements, Trump has indicated that he does not intend to sell his shares. During a press conference, he stated, \"No, I'm not selling,\" emphasizing that he does not require the funds and uses the platform as a method to get his word out.\n\n## Regulatory Requirements\nIf Trump were to sell any of his shares, he would be required to report these transactions to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through a Form 4 filing within two business days. This is a standard requirement for major shareholders owning over 10% of a company.\n\n## Market and Company Dynamics\nThe stock price of TMTG has been highly volatile and is significantly influenced by Trump's political activities and the perception of his brand. Any decision by Trump to sell his shares could impact investor confidence and the stock price.\n\nGiven these points, while Trump has stated he does not plan to sell his shares, the possibility remains that he could change his mind. If he does decide to sell, it would be reported through a Form 4 filing. However, as of the current information, there is no clear indication that he will sell before January 1, 2025.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- **Volatility and Meme Stock Status**: TMTG's stock is categorized as a meme stock, which means its price can fluctuate significantly based on retail investor sentiment and political events rather than traditional valuation metrics.\n- **Historical Performance**: The stock has experienced a significant decline since its peak, which could influence Trump's decision to sell or hold.\n\n### Time to Resolution\nThe lock-up period has already expired, so the window for Trump to sell his shares is now open. Any decision to sell would likely be made in the coming months, with the November election potentially being a significant factor in his decision and the stock's performance.\n\nIn summary, while Trump has stated he does not plan to sell, the situation remains uncertain. If he does sell, it will be reported via a Form 4 filing, but as of now, there is no definitive answer to whether he will sell before January 1, 2025.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump sold any shares of Trump Media & Technology Group in the past?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nAccording to the sources, Donald Trump has not sold any of his shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) despite the expiration of the lock-up period that previously prevented him from doing so. Trump has vowed not to sell his shares, and there is no indication that he has done so.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently legally permitted to sell his shares of Trump Media & Technology Group?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of September 19, 2024, the lock-up period that prohibited Donald Trump and other insiders from selling their shares of Trump Media & Technology Group has expired. This means that Trump is now legally permitted to sell his shares if he chooses to do so.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump publicly stated any intention to sell his shares of Trump Media & Technology Group before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO, Donald Trump has not publicly stated any intention to sell his shares of Trump Media & Technology Group. In fact, he has repeatedly stated that he has \"absolutely no intention\" of selling his shares in the company.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it common for company founders or major shareholders to sell shares after a lock-up period ends?\nANSWER: Yes, it is common for company founders or major shareholders to sell shares after a lock-up period ends.\n\nWhen the lock-up period expires, insiders such as founders, executives, and early investors are no longer restricted from selling their shares. This can lead to a significant number of shares being sold, which can impact the stock price. The behavior of insiders selling their shares after the lock-up period is a notable event that can be interpreted by the market in various ways, including as a potential lack of confidence in the company's future or simply as a need for personal financial planning or portfolio diversification.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any other major shareholders of Trump Media & Technology Group sold their shares recently?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no clear indication that other major shareholders of Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) have sold their shares recently.\n\n- The sources mention that a lockup agreement preventing major shareholders from selling their shares expired, but they do not provide information on whether these shareholders have actually sold their shares since the expiration.\n- There is mention of the possibility that other prominent investors might initiate sales once the lockup period ends, but no confirmation of such sales is provided.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Donald Trump's involvement in the 2024 presidential election decrease the likelihood of him selling his shares?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Donald Trump's involvement in the 2024 presidential election does indeed influence the likelihood of him selling his shares in Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG).\n\n- If Trump wins the election, it is indicated that he would likely hold his TMTG stock. The sources suggest that the value of TMTG could increase if Trump takes office, making it more appealing for him to retain his shares.\n\n- If Trump loses the election, the likelihood of him selling his shares increases due to potential financial pressures, such as needing to pay legal expenses. In this scenario, selling his shares would be necessary but difficult due to the large number of shares he owns.\n\nTherefore, Trump's involvement in the election and the outcome of the election significantly impact the likelihood of him selling his shares.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the stock price of Trump Media & Technology Group increased significantly since September 19, 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if the stock price of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) has increased significantly since September 19, 2024, we need to look at the historical stock prices and recent trends.\n\n- As of October 17, 2024, the stock was trading at around $31.20, with recent highs and significant gains noted in various reports.\n- The stock has seen a substantial increase over the past month, with reports indicating that shares have gained over 50% during this period. For example, the stock was mentioned to have surged from recent lows, with significant daily and weekly gains.\n- There is no specific data provided for September 19, 2024, but the overall trend from recent weeks shows a significant increase.\n\nGiven the information that the stock has risen by over 50% in the past month and has been experiencing significant daily and weekly gains, it is reasonable to conclude that the stock price of Trump Media & Technology Group has indeed increased significantly since September 19, 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming events or deadlines that might incentivize Donald Trump to sell his shares before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: There are several factors and upcoming events that could potentially influence Donald Trump's decision to sell his shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) before January 1, 2025, although it is important to note that Trump has publicly stated he does not intend to sell his shares.\n\n1. **Lock-up Period Expiration**: The lock-up period, which prevented Trump and other insiders from selling their shares, expired on September 19, 2024. This removal of the restriction could technically allow Trump to sell his shares at any time after this date.\n\n2. **Financial Performance and Market Conditions**: The stock has been performing poorly, with significant declines in value. This could create pressure or incentives for Trump or other insiders to sell, especially if the financial situation of the company continues to deteriorate.\n\n3. **November Election Outcome**: The outcome of the November presidential election could significantly impact the value of TMTG shares. If Trump loses the election, the importance and value of Truth Social might diminish, potentially making it more advantageous to sell shares before such a decline.\n\n4. **Legal and Financial Complications**: Trump's financial situation, including mounting legal fees, might necessitate selling shares to cover these expenses. However, Trump has stated he does not require the funds and has no intention of selling.\n\nGiven these factors, while Trump has expressed no intention to sell, the upcoming events and financial pressures could still incentivize him or other insiders to consider selling shares before January 1, 2025. However, based on Trump's public statements, it remains unclear if he will actually sell.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any legal or financial pressures on Donald Trump that might compel him to sell his shares of Trump Media & Technology Group?\nANSWER: There are several legal and financial pressures and considerations that could influence Donald Trump's decision regarding his shares in Trump Media & Technology Group, although they may not necessarily compel him to sell:\n\n## Financial Pressures:\n- Trump faces significant legal expenses and could potentially use the funds from selling his shares to cover these costs. However, selling a substantial portion of his shares could drastically drop the stock price, reducing the value of his remaining holdings.\n- The company's financial performance has been underwhelming, with revenues of only $1.6 million in the first half of 2024 and a net loss of $344 million. This financial instability could impact Trump's decision, but he has stated he has no intention of selling.\n\n## Legal and Regulatory Considerations:\n- Trump's ongoing legal troubles, including 34 felony charges, pose a risk to the company's future and his own reputation. This could indirectly affect the stock price and the company's overall valuation.\n- The lockup period's expiration allows Trump to borrow against his shares, which could provide an alternative to selling the shares outright. However, this does not eliminate the risk of a stock price drop if he decides to sell any portion of his shares.\n\n## Market and Investor Sentiment:\n- The stock price is highly sensitive to Trump's actions and public perception. Selling a significant number of shares could lead to a market glut, depressing the stock price and potentially alienating his supporter base who are also investors.\n\n## Public Perception and Political Ramifications:\n- Trump's decision to sell shares could have political ramifications, as it might be perceived as a lack of confidence in his presidential bid or in the company itself. This could backfire politically and affect his supporter base.\n\nIn summary, while there are various pressures and considerations, Trump has publicly stated that he has \"absolutely no intention of selling\" his shares, which suggests that he is aware of and is choosing to manage these risks rather than being compelled to sell.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Trump Media & Technology Group experiencing financial difficulties that may prompt Donald Trump to sell his shares?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group is indeed experiencing significant financial difficulties. Here are some key points:\n\n- The company reported a revenue of only $837,000 in the last quarter, a 30% decline compared to the previous year, and a loss of $16.4 million in its first complete quarter as a publicly traded entity.\n- The company's stock price has plummeted, with a decline of over 74% since its peak, leading to a substantial decrease in Trump's net worth.\n- The financial struggles have been compounded by high costs associated with its new streaming service and other operational expenses.\n- Despite having over $300 million in cash and equivalents, the company's financial health is a concern, with analysts questioning the viability of the company if Trump does not win the presidential election.\n\nWhile Donald Trump has stated that he has no intention of selling his shares, the financial difficulties and the expiration of the lock-up period that allowed insiders to sell their shares have raised concerns about the potential for significant share divestment, which could further impact the stock price.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately 68 days remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf nothing changes, the outcome would be **No**\u2014Donald Trump has not sold any shares, and there have been no Form 4 filings indicating such a sale.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith about 17 days remaining, I would forecast a lower probability, around **15%**, that Trump would sell shares and file a Form 4 within that shorter timeframe.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\nWith approximately 272 days until the deadline, I would forecast a higher probability, around **40%**, given more time for circumstances to change and potential incentives to sell.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSeveral factors influence the probability that Donald Trump will sell shares of Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) before January 1, 2025:\n\n1. **Public Statements:**\n   - Trump has publicly stated that he has \"absolutely no intention\" of selling his shares.\n   - His commitment to retaining ownership suggests a lower likelihood of selling in the near term.\n\n2. **Lock-Up Period Expiration:**\n   - The lock-up period expired on September 19, 2024, legally permitting him to sell his shares.\n   - Despite this, he has not sold any shares since the expiration.\n\n3. **Upcoming Presidential Election:**\n   - The election is imminent (November 2024), and its outcome could significantly impact his decision.\n   - **If he wins:** He may be less inclined to sell, anticipating that his presidency could enhance the platform's value.\n   - **If he loses:** He might consider selling to cover legal expenses or due to a potential decline in the platform's relevance.\n\n4. **Financial Pressures and Legal Expenses:**\n   - Trump faces substantial legal fees, which could incentivize liquidating assets.\n   - However, selling a large number of shares could negatively impact the stock price and his remaining holdings.\n\n5. **TMTG's Financial Difficulties:**\n   - The company is experiencing financial challenges, including net losses and declining revenues.\n   - This might prompt a reassessment of his investment but also makes selling less attractive if the stock's value is depressed.\n\n6. **Stock Price Increase:**\n   - The stock price has increased significantly since September 19, 2024.\n   - A higher stock price may provide an opportune moment to sell for profit.\n\n7. **Common Practice After Lock-Up Expiration:**\n   - It is common for major shareholders to sell shares after a lock-up period ends.\n   - This historical behavior adds to the probability that he might choose to sell.\n\n8. **Potential Incentives and Deadlines:**\n   - Year-end financial planning or tax considerations might encourage selling before January 1, 2025.\n   - No specific deadlines compel immediate action, but market conditions could prompt a decision.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBalancing these factors, there is a moderate probability that Trump might sell shares before January 1, 2025. His public statements and potential political motivations reduce the likelihood, but financial pressures and the opportunity presented by the increased stock price counterbalance this.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 30%**", "probability": 30}
