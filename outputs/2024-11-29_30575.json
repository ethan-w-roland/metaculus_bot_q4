    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the lowest temperature recorded in Anchorage, Alaska during the entire month of December 2024 be lower than the lowest temperature recorded in Chicago, IL for the month?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the lowest temperature at the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport weather station, reported [here](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/hist.phtml?station=PANC&network=AK_ASOS)  for the month of December 2024, is lower than the lowest temperature at the Chicago, IL Midway Airport weather station, as reported [here](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/hist.phtml?station=MDW&network=IL_ASOS) for the month.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nMissing data for any of the observed values (coded by the NWS as \"MM\") will not be considered. No other resolution source other than the Data Calendars posted at Iowa State University will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe last time this occured was in December 2017, when the lowest temperature recorded in the Chicago weather station during the month was -3 F, while the lowest recorded at the Anchorage weather station was 5 F. It almost occurred in December 2022, when Chicago recorded -9 F on December 23rd; however, Anchorage reached -12 on December 20th. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the lowest temperature recorded in Anchorage, Alaska, during December 2024 will be lower than the lowest temperature recorded in Chicago, IL, for the same month, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska\n- The lowest temperature ever recorded in Anchorage is -38°F (-39°C) on February 3, 1947, but for December specifically, temperatures have been as low as -36°F (-38°C) on several occasions in the early 20th century[2].\n- More recent December temperatures in Anchorage have typically been less extreme, with the lowest temperatures usually ranging from around -20°F to -30°F (-29°C to -34°C)[1][3].\n\n## Historical Temperatures in Chicago, IL\n- Chicago's lowest temperatures are generally milder than Anchorage's. The lowest temperature ever recorded in Chicago is -27°F (-33°C) on January 20, 1985.\n- For December, temperatures in Chicago can drop below 0°F (-18°C), but it is rare for them to drop below -20°F (-29°C).\n\n## Climate Comparison\n- Anchorage is significantly colder than Chicago due to its subarctic climate, while Chicago has a humid continental climate.\n- December is one of the coldest months in both cities, but Anchorage consistently experiences colder temperatures than Chicago.\n\n## Base Rates\n- Historically, Anchorage has a higher likelihood of reaching temperatures below -20°F (-29°C) in December compared to Chicago.\n- The average low temperature in December for Anchorage is around 13°F (-10°C), which is much colder than Chicago's average low of around 18°F (-8°C)[4].\n\nGiven these points, it is highly likely that the lowest temperature recorded in Anchorage, Alaska, during December 2024 will be lower than the lowest temperature recorded in Chicago, IL, for the same month. However, without specific weather forecasts for December 2024, this remains a probabilistic assessment based on historical data.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Anchorage, Alaska recorded a temperature below -15°F in any December since 2010\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about the temperature records in Anchorage, Alaska, particularly for December temperatures since 2010. The sources discuss various topics such as wetsuits, boat anchorages, gigging in cold towns, driving to Alaska, and GPS trackers, but none of them provide the necessary data on temperature records for Anchorage.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the historical trend of December temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska been decreasing in recent years\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or analysis that indicates a decreasing trend in December temperatures in Anchorage, Alaska, in recent years.\n\n- The sources provide historical averages and normals for December temperatures, but they do not include trend analyses or comparisons over recent years[1][3][4].\n- To determine if there has been a decreasing trend, one would need to examine temperature data over a specific period, such as the last few decades, which is not provided in the sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is December 2024 predicted to be colder than average in Anchorage, Alaska\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that December 2024 in Anchorage, Alaska is expected to be colder than average.\n\n- The forecast for the first days of December 2024 in Anchorage predicts temperatures of around -6.3°F, which is cooler than the historical average of -3.6°F at the beginning of the month[1].\n- Daytime temperatures are expected to reach around -6°C (21.2°F), and nighttime temperatures are expected to be around -13°C (8.6°F), which are also indicative of colder conditions[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an ongoing cold wave scheduled to impact Anchorage, Alaska in December 2024\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of a scheduled or predicted cold wave specifically for Anchorage, Alaska in December 2024. The sources discuss the cold snap and weather conditions in January and February 2024, but they do not provide forecasts or predictions for December 2024.\n\n- The sources focus on the cold snap in late January and early February 2024[2][3].\n- The information about December weather in Anchorage is based on average historical data and does not mention any specific cold wave predictions for December 2024[4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Chicago, IL particularly prone to temperature drops below -10°F in December\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- The average temperatures in Chicago during December are around 27.7°F (mean temperature), with lows averaging 20.7°F[3].\n- While it is common for temperatures to drop below 0°F in December, the sources do not specifically indicate that temperatures frequently drop below -10°F. However, extreme cold snaps can occur, and wind chill values can make the temperature feel much colder[2][3].\n\nGiven this information, it is not explicitly stated that Chicago is particularly prone to temperature drops below -10°F in December, but it is possible during extreme cold snaps.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a record low temperature forecasted in Anchorage, Alaska for December 2024\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that a record low temperature is forecasted for Anchorage, Alaska in December 2024.\n\n- The sources provide forecasts and average temperature ranges for December, but they do not mention any record-low temperatures predicted for the month[1][2][3].\n- The forecasts indicate that temperatures will be cold, with daytime highs around -6°C (21°F) and nighttime lows around -13°C (9°F), but these are within the expected range for the month and not indicated as record lows[1][2][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, there is no record low temperature forecasted for Anchorage, Alaska in December 2024 based on the available information.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Chicago, IL recorded a temperature below -5°F in any December since 2010\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data mentioned about temperatures below -5°F in any December since 2010 for Chicago, IL.\n\n- The source from the National Weather Service (NWS) provides detailed climate data for 2016, including December, but does not mention temperatures below -5°F for that month or any other December since 2010[1].\n- The other sources discuss general trends in winter temperatures and climate changes but do not provide specific temperature records for December in the relevant years[2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as the provided sources do not contain the necessary information to confirm whether Chicago has recorded a temperature below -5°F in any December since 2010.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is December 2024 predicted to be colder than average in Chicago, IL\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the predictions for December 2024 temperatures in Chicago are not definitive in terms of being colder than average.\n\n- NOAA's winter weather outlook suggests that there are \"equal chances\" of temperatures being above or below average for the winter season, which includes December[2].\n- AccuWeather predicts a colder winter overall, but does not specify that December will be colder than average. It mentions that the La Niña pattern could make the winter feel colder compared to the previous year, but this is not a definitive statement for December specifically[3].\n- The Old Farmer's Almanac predicts that winter will be warmer than normal in the east, but does not provide a specific temperature prediction for December in Chicago that indicates it will be colder than average[4].\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Chicago, IL recorded lower temperatures than Anchorage, Alaska in December in the past 10 years\nANSWER: To determine if Chicago, IL has recorded lower temperatures than Anchorage, AK in December over the past 10 years, we need to compare the temperature records for both cities during this period.\n\n### Anchorage, AK\n- The average temperature in Anchorage in December is around 22°F, with a seasonal minimum of 20°F and a high seasonal norm of 25°F. There are typically 29 days with temperatures under 32°F (94% of the time)[1].\n\n### Chicago, IL\n- Historical climate data for Chicago shows that December temperatures can be quite cold. For example, the average low temperature in December can be around 18°F to 20°F, but it can drop significantly lower. Record low temperatures in December for Chicago can be well below 0°F[4].\n\nGiven these general trends:\n- Anchorage's average low temperature in December is around 20°F.\n- Chicago's average low temperature in December can be similar or slightly lower, but it has the potential to drop much lower than Anchorage's lows.\n\n### Specific Records\nWhile the provided sources do not give a year-by-year comparison for the past 10 years, historical climate data indicates that Chicago can experience colder temperatures than Anchorage, especially when considering record lows.\n\nTherefore, based on the potential for Chicago to have colder record lows and the variability in winter temperatures, it is reasonable to conclude that:\n\n**YES**, Chicago, IL has recorded lower temperatures than Anchorage, AK in December in the past 10 years.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming weather anomalies expected to affect temperature extremes in Anchorage, Alaska in December 2024\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, here are the key points related to weather anomalies and temperature extremes in Anchorage, Alaska for December 2024:\n\n## Temperature Outlook\n- The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) forecasts that the December-January-February (DJF) 2024-2025 period will have below-normal temperatures for much of southern Alaska, which includes Anchorage[5].\n\n## La Niña Impact\n- NOAA predicts a La Niña event, which typically results in cooler and wetter conditions in Alaska during the winter months. This suggests that Anchorage could experience cooler temperatures than usual[3][4].\n\n## Specific Weather Averages\n- For December, Anchorage is expected to have daytime temperatures around -6°C and nighttime temperatures around -13°C, which are typical for the month. However, the La Niña pattern could exacerbate these cold conditions[1].\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that there are upcoming weather anomalies expected to affect temperature extremes in Anchorage, Alaska in December 2024, primarily due to the anticipated La Niña event and the CPC's temperature outlook.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 9 days (from November 29, 2024, to early January 2025).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf historical patterns persist and there are no significant climatic anomalies, it is likely that the lowest temperature in Anchorage, Alaska, during December 2024 will be lower than that in Chicago, IL.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about 2-3 days left, the forecast would rely heavily on current weather trends and any short-term forecasts. Given Anchorage's generally colder climate in December, the probability remains high, though slightly lower due to reduced data availability.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith an extended timeframe (approximately 36 days), the forecast could incorporate long-term climatic patterns, climate models, and potential anomalies such as La Niña effects. This would likely reinforce the higher probability that Anchorage's lowest temperature will be lower than Chicago's for December 2024.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nHistorical data indicates that Anchorage typically experiences colder temperatures in December compared to Chicago. While there have been instances where Chicago recorded lower temperatures (e.g., December 2017 and 2022), the overall trend favors Anchorage being the colder city during this month. Additionally, the anticipated La Niña event and the Climate Prediction Center's forecast for below-normal temperatures in southern Alaska bolster the likelihood of Anchorage experiencing lower temperatures. Although specific short-term forecasts are limited, the combination of historical trends and expected climatic conditions supports a high probability for Anchorage's lowest temperature being lower than Chicago's in December 2024.\n\n**Probability:** 85%",
