    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nOn December 31, 2024, will exactly 4 US states have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as the number of US states, including Washington, D.C., in which fully rider-only ride-hailing trips operated by Waymo are available to the general public on January 1, 2026.\n\nThe primary resolution source will be Waymo's website, which as of early 2024 includes a [\"Where Can You Go?\"](https://waymo.com/whereyoucango/) page. Other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) may also be considered in the event of ambiguity or dispute.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- \"rider-only\" trip means one in which the only humans in the car are passengers and no human operates the vehicle for the duration of the trip.\n- \"Available to the general public\" means that any member of the public is eligible to use the service without first joining a waitlist or having been granted use of the service as part of a limited testing or early access phase.\n- \"United States\" means the 50 states plus the District of Columbia. Therefore the possible outcome range is 0-51.\n- In the event that Waymo's operating status in a given state is ambiguous or disputed, Metaculus admins will resolve the state's status based on the best available information indicating whether, in fact, its autonomous ride-hailing service is publicly available for ride-hailing on January 1, 2026.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThis question is part of the [Understanding AI Series with Timothy B Lee](https://www.metaculus.com/project/3055/) and was inspired by [this post](https://www.understandingai.org/p/new-data-shows-waymo-crashes-a-lot).\n\nWaymo, the Alphabet-owned self-driving technology company, has emerged as a pioneer in the development of autonomous vehicles. Since its inception as Google’s self-driving car project in 2009, Waymo’s vehicles have logged over 7 million miles of rider-only trips.\n\nAs of early 2024, Waymo operates its rider-only ride-hailing service in California (San Francisco and Los Angeles) and Arizona (Phoenix), and has announced plans to expand operations to Texas (Austin).\n\nIn late 2023, Waymo published a [report](https://waymo.com/blog/2023/12/waymo-significantly-outperforms-comparable-human-benchmarks-over-7-million/) claiming that its autonomous vehicles have achieved an 85% reduction in the rate of injury-causing compared to national rates for human-operated cars, highlighting the potential of self-driving cars to reduce crashes caused by human error.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if exactly 4 US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public by December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Service Areas\n- Waymo's Waymo One service is already available to the general public in Phoenix, Arizona, and has been expanded to San Francisco and Los Angeles, California.\n- The service is also operational in Austin, Texas, although it is still in the testing phase and not yet fully open to the public as of the latest updates.\n\n## Expansion Plans\n- Waymo has announced plans to offer Waymo One to the public in Austin later in 2024, following the current testing phase.\n\n## States Involved\n- As of now, the service is available in Arizona (Phoenix) and California (San Francisco and Los Angeles).\n- Texas (Austin) is expected to join this list by the end of 2024.\n\nGiven this information:\n- By December 31, 2024, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service will be available in Arizona, California, and Texas.\n- This would mean that exactly 3 states will have the service available to the general public.\n\nTherefore, based on the current information, the answer to whether exactly 4 US states will have Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public by December 31, 2024, is **no**. Only three states are expected to have this service by that date.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of November 6, 2024, is Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public in California?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nAs of November 6, 2024, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service is available to the general public in California. Specifically, the service is open to everyone in San Francisco, and it has also been expanded to include various areas in the San Francisco Peninsula and Los Angeles County.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service expected to be available to the general public in Texas by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nBased on the provided sources, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service in Texas, specifically in Austin, is not expected to be available to the general public by December 31, 2024. The sources indicate that the service will be opened to the public in Austin, but this is scheduled to happen in early 2025, not before the end of 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Waymo formed partnerships with any cities or states that could lead to service expansion by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Waymo has formed partnerships that will lead to service expansions, but these expansions are scheduled to begin in early 2025, not by December 31, 2024.\n\n- The partnership with Uber to bring Waymo services to Atlanta and Austin is set to start in early 2025.\n- There is no mention of any service expansions scheduled to be operational by December 31, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Waymo currently conducting pilot programs or tests of its rider-only ride-hailing service in any new US states?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Waymo is not currently conducting pilot programs or tests of its rider-only ride-hailing service in any new US states beyond those where it is already operational.\n\n- Waymo is already operating in California, Arizona, and will be expanding to Texas and Georgia (specifically, Austin and Atlanta) in early 2025, but these expansions have been announced and are not considered new pilot programs or tests as of now.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence that Waymo plans to delay further expansion of its rider-only ride-hailing service until after December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: There is no evidence in the provided sources to suggest that Waymo plans to delay further expansion of its rider-only ride-hailing service until after December 31, 2024. The sources discuss current and recent expansions, as well as future plans for growth and technological improvements, but do not mention any specific delays or timelines related to the end of 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of November 6, 2024, is Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service available to the general public in Arizona?\nANSWER: Yes, as of November 6, 2024, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service is available to the general public in Arizona. The service, known as Waymo One, operates across a significant area of Metro Phoenix, covering 315 square miles and including various destinations such as Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, Scottsdale, and Mesa.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any US states besides Arizona, California, and Texas granted regulatory approval for Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service as of November 6, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 6, 2024, there is no mention in the provided sources of any US states besides Arizona, California, and Texas granting regulatory approval for Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service. The sources discuss expansions and approvals in California, Arizona, and the upcoming services in Texas, as well as plans for Georgia, but they do not indicate any other states have granted such approvals.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Waymo announced plans to expand its rider-only ride-hailing service to any additional US states beyond Arizona, California, and Texas before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear announcement from Waymo about expanding its rider-only ride-hailing service to additional US states beyond Arizona, California, and Texas before December 31, 2024.\n\n- The sources mention expansions to new cities such as Austin and Atlanta, but these cities are within the states of Texas and no new states are mentioned for expansion before the end of 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Based on Waymo's historical rate of expansion, is it likely they will add exactly one more state to their rider-only service by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is unclear whether Waymo will add exactly one more state to their rider-only service by December 31, 2024.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- Waymo has been expanding its services rapidly, with significant growth in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, and plans to expand to new cities like Austin, Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia in 2025.\n- There is no specific mention of any new state or city additions planned for the remainder of 2024, only that the expansions to Austin and Atlanta are slated for 2025.\n\nTherefore, the information does not provide a clear answer to whether exactly one more state will be added by the end of 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant regulatory barriers preventing Waymo from expanding its rider-only ride-hailing service to new states before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: There are several regulatory and legislative factors that could pose significant barriers to Waymo's expansion of its rider-only ride-hailing service to new states before December 31, 2024:\n\n## California:\n- While Waymo has received approval to operate in Los Angeles and the San Francisco peninsula, there are ongoing discussions and potential legislative hurdles, such as SB 915, which could give local communities more control over the regulation of autonomous vehicles. This could slow down or complicate expansion within California and potentially other states if similar legislation is adopted.\n\n## New York:\n- In New York, there are strict regulations requiring a human driver to be present during testing. Pending legislation (SB 8468) would need to be passed to allow autonomous vehicles to operate without human drivers. The current regulatory environment and opposition from labor unions and local officials present significant barriers.\n\n## General Regulatory Environment:\n- The lack of federal regulation and the need for state-by-state approvals create a complex regulatory landscape. This can lead to varying levels of acceptance and regulatory hurdles in different states, making expansion challenging.\n\nGiven these factors, it is clear that there are significant regulatory barriers that could prevent or delay Waymo's expansion to new states before the end of 2024.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of November 6, 2024, there are **55 days** remaining until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and December 31, 2024, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service would remain available to the general public in **Arizona** and **California**, totaling **2 states**. Therefore, the outcome would be that exactly 4 US states **would not** have the service.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **14 days** left until December 31, 2024, the likelihood of Waymo expanding its service to two additional states to reach exactly 4 states would be even **lower**. Regulatory approvals and operational logistics typically require significant time, making such rapid expansion highly improbable.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **220 days** remaining (4 times the current time), extending into mid-2025, the probability of Waymo expanding to exactly 4 states would be **higher**. Given that Waymo plans to launch services in **Texas** (Austin) and **Georgia** (Atlanta) in early 2025, reaching a total of 4 states would be plausible within that extended timeframe.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 6, 2024, Waymo's rider-only ride-hailing service is operational and available to the general public in **Arizona** and **California**. While Waymo has announced plans to expand its service to **Austin, Texas**, and **Atlanta, Georgia**, these expansions are scheduled for **early 2025**, not before December 31, 2024.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the low likelihood of reaching exactly 4 states by the end of 2024:\n\n- **Regulatory Barriers:** Significant regulatory approvals are required for autonomous ride-hailing services. Obtaining these approvals in new states typically involves navigating complex legislative environments, which cannot be expedited easily.\n  \n- **Operational Logistics:** Establishing operations in a new state involves fleet deployment, mapping, testing, and safety evaluations. These processes are time-intensive and unlikely to be completed within the remaining 55 days.\n  \n- **No Announced Plans for 2024 Expansion:** There are no public announcements or indications from Waymo that they plan to launch in any additional states before the end of 2024.\n  \n- **Historical Expansion Rate:** Waymo's historical expansion suggests deliberate and measured growth, focusing on safety and regulatory compliance over rapid scaling.\n\nGiven these considerations, the chances of Waymo unexpectedly launching its rider-only service in exactly two additional states (to total four) by December 31, 2024, are extremely low.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 1%**",
