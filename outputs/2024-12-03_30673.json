    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill New Zealand report <275 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-03\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if the total number of cases reported by the Institute of Environmental Science and Research's Pertussis Dashboard for both weeks 51 and 52, when they are posted is under 275.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- Week 51 ends on December 20, 2024, and the data are expected to be posted on December 25, 2024. Week 52 ends on December 27, 2024, and the data are expected to be posted on January 1, 2025.\r\n- This question will resolve on the first day after January 1, 2025 that data for both weeks are shown on the dashboard. Potential data revisions will not change the resolution. If the relevant numbers are not available on the dashboard before January 7, 2025, Admins may use alternative [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions), as long as their numbers are consistent with the dashboard's numbers.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nWhooping cough is a serious disease. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whooping_cough):\r\n> Whooping cough also known as pertussis or the 100-day cough, is a highly contagious, vaccine-preventable bacterial disease. Initial symptoms are usually similar to those of the common cold with a runny nose, fever, and mild cough, but these are followed by two or three months of severe coughing fits. Following a fit of coughing, a high-pitched whoop sound or gasp may occur as the person breathes in. The violent coughing may last for 10 or more weeks, hence the phrase \"100-day cough\". The cough may be so hard that it causes vomiting, rib fractures, and fatigue. Children less than one year old may have little or no cough and instead have periods when they cannot breathe.\r\n\r\nOn 22 November 2024, the Ministry of Health of New Zealand [declared](https://www.health.govt.nz/news/whooping-cough-epidemic-declared-across-aotearoa-new-zealand) an epidemic of whooping cough across the country, as cases have been rising with 263 cases over the four weeks from mid October to mid November.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of New Zealand reporting fewer than 275 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Epidemic Status\nNew Zealand has recently declared a whooping cough epidemic, with 263 cases reported in the four weeks leading up to November 15, which is the highest number of cases over a four-week period in 2024[2][3][4].\n\n## Case Trends\nThe epidemic has shown consistently high case numbers, with 77 cases reported in the week prior to the declaration, including hospitalizations, particularly among infants under the age of 1[1].\n\n## Historical Context\nWhooping cough epidemics in New Zealand can last for months or even up to 18 months, and they tend to occur every few years even in highly immunized populations[2].\n\n## Vaccination and Public Health Response\nHealth officials are emphasizing the importance of vaccination, especially for pregnant individuals and infants, to protect vulnerable groups. A nationally coordinated response is in place to manage the epidemic[2][4].\n\n## Geographic Spread\nThe infection is not limited to specific areas but has spread across various regions, with some areas like Wairarapa showing higher infection rates[3].\n\n## Predictive Factors\nGiven the ongoing nature of the epidemic and the historical context that such epidemics can be prolonged, it is uncertain whether the case numbers will significantly drop in the short term. However, public health efforts, including vaccination campaigns, may influence the trajectory of the epidemic.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\nPrevious epidemics have shown that case numbers can fluctuate but generally remain high over several months. The current epidemic's case rate is among the highest since early 2019[4].\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is possible that public health measures could reduce case numbers, the current trends and historical context suggest that predicting fewer than 275 cases for weeks 51 and 52 is uncertain. The answer to whether New Zealand will report fewer than 275 cases is not immediately clear based on the available information. Therefore, it would be prudent for a superforecaster to consider these factors and the ongoing public health response when making a prediction.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have vaccination rates for whooping cough increased among pregnant individuals in New Zealand in the past month?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not offer specific data on the vaccination rates for whooping cough among pregnant individuals in New Zealand over the past month. While they discuss the current epidemic, the importance of maternal vaccination, and historical trends in vaccination rates, they do not provide real-time or recent monthly data on vaccination rates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been environmental changes in New Zealand that could reduce the transmission of whooping cough during weeks 51 and 52?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not address the specific question of whether environmental changes in New Zealand could reduce the transmission of whooping cough during weeks 51 and 52. The information available focuses on climate change, emissions reductions, and general environmental trends, but it does not include any data or analysis related to the transmission of whooping cough or other infectious diseases.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the number of whooping cough-related hospitalizations in New Zealand decreased in recent weeks?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication that the number of whooping cough-related hospitalizations in New Zealand has decreased in recent weeks.\n\n- The sources mention that there have been consistent and high numbers of whooping cough cases and hospitalizations. For example, as of the latest figures, 63 cases under 12 months old were reported, with almost three quarters of those cases resulting in hospitalizations[3].\n- There is no specific data or statement indicating a decrease in hospitalizations in recent weeks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the reporting system for whooping cough cases in New Zealand functioning without significant delays or errors?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically address the functionality or efficiency of the reporting system for whooping cough cases in New Zealand in terms of delays or errors.\n\n- The sources discuss the current outbreak, the importance of vaccination, symptoms, and treatment of whooping cough, as well as the public health response and measures to control the spread of the disease[1][2][4].\n- However, they do not provide information on the performance or any issues related to the reporting system itself.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the reporting system for whooping cough cases in New Zealand is functioning without significant delays or errors is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have similar whooping cough epidemics in New Zealand in the past shown a decline in cases during the equivalent timeframe of weeks 51 and 52?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information that details the exact trends of whooping cough cases during the weeks 51 and 52 (late December) in past epidemics.\n\nThe sources do mention that pertussis epidemics in New Zealand typically occur every 3-5 years and can last for 12-18 months, but they do not provide detailed weekly case data or specific trends for the end-of-year period[3][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether similar whooping cough epidemics in New Zealand have shown a decline in cases during the equivalent timeframe of weeks 51 and 52 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the resource allocation for managing the whooping cough epidemic in New Zealand sufficient to control the spread of the disease?\nANSWER: The sufficiency of the resource allocation for managing the whooping cough epidemic in New Zealand is uncertain based on the provided sources.\n\nWhile the sources indicate that health officials are well-prepared and a national response team has been established to coordinate and support public health services[1][3][5], there are also concerns raised about the resources. Specifically, it is mentioned that on the same day the epidemic was announced, the National Public Health Service warned staff of a \"reset\" before Christmas to cut millions of dollars from its budget, which could potentially impact the resources available to manage the epidemic[3].\n\nGiven this mixed information, it is unclear whether the current resource allocation is sufficient to control the spread of the disease effectively.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a downward trend in weekly whooping cough cases in New Zealand since mid-November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of a downward trend in weekly whooping cough cases in New Zealand since mid-November 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources indicate that a national whooping cough epidemic was declared due to high and consistently increasing case numbers. As of mid-November, there were 263 cases in the past four weeks, which was the highest number over a four-week period for 2024[1][3][4].\n- By the end of November, the total number of whooping cough cases for 2024 had risen to 1,009, with 77 cases reported in the week leading up to November 29[2].\n- There is no mention of a decline in case numbers in the sources provided.\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that the case numbers have continued to rise rather than decrease.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are public health campaigns promoting whooping cough vaccination actively implemented across all regions of New Zealand?\nANSWER: Yes, public health campaigns promoting whooping cough vaccination are actively implemented across various regions of New Zealand.\n\n- Health New Zealand and other health agencies have declared a national whooping cough epidemic, prompting widespread public health responses. These include urging vaccinations for pregnant people, babies, and other high-risk groups across the country[2][3][5].\n- Specific initiatives such as visits to maternity clinics and hapū wānanga in different regions, including south Auckland and Hamilton, have been undertaken to promote and provide vaccinations[2].\n- Community pop-up clinics and immunisation events are being organized in various regions, including the Northern region, to ensure access to vaccinations[2].\n- Public health messages and alerts have been sent out to clinical networks nationwide, encouraging practitioners to remain vigilant and promote vaccinations[5].\n\nThese efforts indicate a comprehensive and active implementation of public health campaigns across different regions of New Zealand.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any new public health interventions introduced in New Zealand to control the whooping cough epidemic after mid-November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been new public health interventions introduced in New Zealand to control the whooping cough epidemic after mid-November 2024.\n\n- Public health authorities have declared a national whooping cough epidemic and initiated a nationally coordinated response, which includes promoting vaccinations to protect vulnerable groups such as newborn babies and older adults[2][3][5].\n- Pregnant women are being advised to get a free Boostrix vaccination from 16 weeks of pregnancy to protect their newborns[2][3][5].\n- There is an emphasis on ensuring timely immunization for all babies at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 5 months, and booster shots at 4 years and 11 years for children[2][3].\n- Booster vaccinations are recommended for healthcare workers and lead maternity carers every 5-10 years, depending on employer requirements[2].\n- Community pop-up clinics and immunisation events have been organized to increase vaccination access[4].\n- Health professionals are being asked to remain vigilant for people presenting with symptoms and to continue promoting vaccinations to protect vulnerable groups[2][3].\n\nThese measures indicate a proactive and coordinated public health response to the epidemic.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the overall immunity level against whooping cough in the New Zealand population high due to recent vaccination efforts?\nANSWER: The overall immunity level against whooping cough in the New Zealand population is not necessarily high despite recent vaccination efforts, as indicated by several factors:\n\n1. **Current Epidemic**: A national whooping cough epidemic has been declared due to high levels of pertussis cases and hospitalizations, suggesting that the disease is still widespread and affecting various age groups and ethnicities[2][3][4].\n\n2. **Vaccination Rates**: While there has been an improvement in vaccination rates, with 82% of one-year-olds vaccinated in 2024 compared to 63% in 2023, this does not necessarily translate to a high overall immunity level across the entire population[2].\n\n3. **Epidemic Cycles**: Pertussis epidemics in New Zealand occur every 3-5 years and can last for 12-18 months, indicating that despite vaccination efforts, the disease continues to circulate in the population[4][5].\n\n4. **Vaccine Efficacy**: The vaccines used have an efficacy of around 81-85% after three infant doses, but this efficacy can wane over time, and not all individuals may be up-to-date with their vaccinations[5].\n\nGiven these points, while vaccination efforts are ongoing and important, the current epidemic and ongoing transmission suggest that the overall immunity level against whooping cough in the New Zealand population is not sufficiently high to prevent widespread outbreaks.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as the sources indicate ongoing issues despite vaccination efforts)",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**  \n30 days (from December 3, 2024, to January 2, 2025).\n\n**(b) Outcome if nothing changed:**  \nYes, New Zealand would report fewer than 275 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52.\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nProbability: 85%\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was four times the time left:**  \nProbability: 90%\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAs of December 3, 2024, New Zealand is navigating a declared whooping cough epidemic, with 263 cases reported in the four weeks leading up to mid-November. Recent weekly case numbers, such as the 77 cases reported up to November 29, suggest a persistent and possibly increasing trend. Historical data indicates that whooping cough epidemics in New Zealand can last between 12 to 18 months, underscoring the enduring nature of the outbreak.\n\nPublic health responses are actively in place, including vaccination campaigns targeting vulnerable populations like pregnant individuals and infants. These efforts are crucial in mitigating the spread. However, there are uncertainties regarding the sufficiency of resource allocation due to potential budget cuts, which could impact the effectiveness of the response.\n\nGiven that the threshold is 275 cases over two weeks, and current weekly numbers are around 77, the projected total for weeks 51 and 52 would be approximately 154 cases if current trends continue unchanged. This is well below the 275-case threshold, leading to a high probability of the outcome being **Yes**.\n\nWhen considering different time frames:\n- **With only a quarter of the time left (approximately one week):** There is less data to project trends accurately, introducing some uncertainty. Therefore, the probability is slightly reduced to **85%**.\n- **With four times the time left (approximately four months):** Greater time allows for more data and the potential impact of ongoing public health measures to be observed, thereby increasing confidence in the forecast to **90%**.\n\nTaking into account the current trends, historical context, and public health interventions, the best estimate for the probability that New Zealand will report fewer than 275 whooping cough cases for weeks 51 and 52 is high.\n\n**Probability: 90%**",
