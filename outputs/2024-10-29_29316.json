    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the U.S. have passed legislation that requires cybersecurity around AI models before 2025?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, there is a federal law which requires all U.S. actors in possession of AI models fitting certain criteria to take measures to secure those models. The law must be designed to promote security of powerful models, rather than, for example, models that might compromise individuals' privacy if stolen. If necessary, this will be decided by a judging panel made up of the Metaculus AI Forecasting team, or, failing that (e.g., because the AI Forecasting team no longer exists), at least 3 Metaculus admins: the judging panel would consider the stated intent of those who proposed the initial version of the bill.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThere may well be overlap between the most powerful models and the models that most compromise privacy. For this question’s resolution, what matters is whether the law is _intended_ to secure _powerful_ models.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nMany AI experts worry about powerful AI getting into the hands of bad actors—those who might use such powerful AI to cause damage or for personal gain that inflicts costs on others—via hacking. A bad actor might be a black hat hacker, a terrorist group, or a rogue state.\n\nOne way to decrease the chance of this type of hacking succeeding is for those building powerful AI, the leading AI labs, to have strong cybersecurity measures in place. Given how high the stakes might be (see, e.g., “[AI risk](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-risk)”), policymakers may decide to not bank on AI labs attaining strong enough cybersecurity by default.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nAs of the current date, there are several initiatives and proposals at various stages that address the cybersecurity and safety of AI models, but whether comprehensive legislation will be passed before 2025 is not yet clear.\n\n### Proposed and Enacted Legislation\n- Several state-level bills have been introduced, such as the California AI Transparency Act (SB 942) and Colorado's artificial intelligence consumer protection bill (SB24-205), which include provisions related to AI transparency and algorithmic discrimination, but these do not specifically focus on cybersecurity around AI models.\n- The Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Systems Act (SB 1047) proposes requirements for AI developers to ensure their models do not possess hazardous capabilities and mandates reporting of AI safety incidents, but this is still in the proposed stage.\n\n### Federal Initiatives\n- The Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, issued in October 2023, outlines a comprehensive approach to AI safety and security, including robust evaluations, risk assessments, and mitigation strategies. However, this is an executive order rather than legislation.\n- The 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes provisions related to AI governance, cybersecurity, and the development of AI-enabled applications within the Department of Defense. While this bill addresses AI and cybersecurity, it is specifically focused on defense and military applications rather than a broad legislative mandate for all AI models.\n\n### Ongoing Developments\n- There are ongoing efforts to develop and implement regulations and guidelines for AI safety and security, including the establishment of an Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board and regular risk assessments by relevant agencies. However, these are part of executive actions and regulatory processes rather than legislative enactments.\n\nGiven the current status, while there are significant efforts to address AI safety and cybersecurity, it is not clear whether comprehensive legislation specifically requiring cybersecurity around AI models will be passed before 2025. The answer to this question remains uncertain based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any federal agencies recommended or urged Congress to pass legislation requiring cybersecurity for AI models?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of federal agencies recommending or urging Congress to pass legislation specifically requiring cybersecurity for AI models. The sources detail various executive actions, guidelines, and internal agency initiatives aimed at ensuring the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI, but they do not indicate any direct recommendations or urges to Congress for legislation on this matter.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the U.S. Congress scheduled to be in session before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the U.S. Congress is not scheduled to be in session before January 1, 2025.\n\n- The 118th Congress, which is the current Congress, will conclude on January 3, 2025.\n- The 119th Congress, which will be the next Congress, is scheduled to convene on January 3, 2025.\n\nTherefore, there are no scheduled sessions of the U.S. Congress before January 1, 2025.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any proposed federal legislation on AI cybersecurity passed committee votes in Congress?\nANSWER: Yes, proposed federal legislation on AI cybersecurity has passed committee votes in Congress.\n\n- The Senate Rules Committee passed three bills aimed at safeguarding elections from AI deception, including the Preparing Election Administrators for AI Act, the Protect Elections from Deceptive AI Act, and the AI Transparency in Elections Act.\n- In the House, the AI Incident Reporting and Security Enhancement Act, which directs NIST to set up a vulnerability reporting process for AI systems, was approved by the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any existing federal law been amended to include requirements for cybersecurity around powerful AI models?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication that an existing federal law has been amended specifically to include requirements for cybersecurity around powerful AI models. However, there are several executive orders, memoranda, and proposed rules that address the safety, security, and trustworthy development of AI systems, including cybersecurity aspects.\n\nFor example, the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (Executive Order 14110) and the subsequent memoranda and proposed rules outline various measures to ensure the safe and secure development of AI systems, including evaluations and reporting requirements related to cybersecurity risks.\n\nHowever, these are executive actions and proposed regulations rather than amendments to existing federal laws. Therefore, the answer to whether any existing federal law has been amended to include these requirements is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the U.S. Congress passed any federal legislation requiring cybersecurity measures for AI models designed to secure powerful models as of today?\nANSWER: As of today, there is no indication that the U.S. Congress has passed federal legislation specifically requiring cybersecurity measures for AI models to secure powerful models.\n\n- The Federal Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Act of 2024, introduced in the House of Representatives, is still in the process of being considered and has not yet been passed into law.\n- The Senate AI Roadmap is a guidance document and not a formal legislative proposal, although it suggests areas for potential future legislation.\n- Other updates and initiatives mentioned, such as those from the Department of Homeland Security and the Biden Administration's National Security Memorandum, are executive actions or proposals rather than enacted legislation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the current legislative agenda of Congress include AI cybersecurity legislation?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe current legislative agenda of Congress includes several bills and initiatives focused on AI cybersecurity. Here are some examples:\n\n- The **AI for National Security Act (H.R. 1718)**, which modifies Department of Defense policy related to the procurement of cyber data products and services, including the use of AI-based endpoint security.\n- The **AI Incident Reporting and Security Enhancement Act**, introduced by Reps. Deborah Ross, Jay Obernolte, and Don Beyer, which directs NIST to set up a formal process for reporting security vulnerabilities in AI systems.\n- The **Secure AI Act of 2024**, introduced by Sens. Mark Warner and Thom Tillis, which requires NIST and CISA to update databases and establishes an AI Security Center.\n- A series of bipartisan bills approved by the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, including measures to increase support for AI research, development, and safety, and to promote best practices in AI security.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any federal bills currently pending in Congress that require cybersecurity for powerful AI models?\nANSWER: Yes, there are federal bills currently pending in Congress that include provisions related to cybersecurity for powerful AI models.\n\n1. **The Secure Artificial Intelligence Act of 2024 (S. 4230)**: This bill aims to improve the tracking and processing of security and safety incidents and risks associated with artificial intelligence. It includes provisions for NIST to update the National Vulnerability Database, establish a voluntary database to track AI security and safety incidents, and develop best practices for addressing supply chain risks associated with AI model training and maintenance.\n\n2. **The Federal Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Act of 2024 (H.R. 6936)**: This bill requires Federal agencies to use the Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework developed by NIST. It includes guidelines for agencies to incorporate cybersecurity strategies and the installation of effective cybersecurity tools to improve the security of AI systems.\n\n3. **The Content Origin Protection and Integrity from Edited and Deepfaked Media Act of 2024 (COPIED Act)**: While primarily focused on transparency and provenance of AI-generated content, this bill also directs NIST to develop cybersecurity measures to prevent tampering with provenance and watermarking on AI content.\n\nThese bills all contain elements that address cybersecurity for AI models.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent major cybersecurity incidents involving AI models in the U.S. that could spur legislative action?\nANSWER: While the sources provided do not specify recent major cybersecurity incidents in the U.S. that are exclusively attributed to AI models and could spur legislative action, they do highlight several significant points:\n\n1. **Increased Use of AI in Cyber Attacks**: There has been a notable increase in the use of AI by cyber attackers, making attacks more sophisticated and effective. For example, AI is used in social engineering, phishing, and ransomware attacks, which can impact various sectors including financial institutions and government agencies.\n\n2. **Recent Ransomware Attack**: A recent example mentioned is the large-scale ransomware attack on the US arm of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), although it does not specifically state that AI was the primary tool used in this attack.\n\n3. **Federal Agencies' Concerns**: Federal agencies such as the Treasury Department, State Department, and FBI have expressed concerns about the rising threat of AI-fueled cyberattacks. These agencies are emphasizing the need for better coordination and information-sharing to combat these threats.\n\nGiven the lack of a specific, recent major incident directly attributed to AI models that is detailed in these sources, the answer to whether there have been such incidents that could spur legislative action is not definitively clear from the provided information.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there bipartisan support in Congress for legislation requiring cybersecurity around powerful AI models?\nANSWER: Yes, there is bipartisan support in Congress for legislation related to the cybersecurity and regulation of powerful AI models.\n\nSeveral sources indicate this bipartisan support:\n- The Bipartisan Senate Artificial Intelligence Working Group, led by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, has released a roadmap that includes proposals for addressing AI risks, such as enforcing existing AI laws, mitigating potential long-term risks, and ensuring the security of AI systems.\n- The CREATE AI Act, introduced by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, aims to provide researchers with the tools needed to develop safe and trustworthy AI systems, which includes considerations for cybersecurity.\n- The Future of AI Innovation Act, passed by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, authorizes the NIST AI Safety Institute to develop voluntary guidelines and rigorous testing for advanced AI models, which includes aspects of cybersecurity.\n- The Secure Artificial Intelligence Act, introduced by Representatives Deborah Ross and Don Beyer, and supported by Senators Mark Warner and Thom Tillis, focuses on enhancing the security of AI systems and mitigating risk incidents, further indicating bipartisan support for AI cybersecurity legislation.\n\nThese initiatives demonstrate a collaborative effort across party lines to address the cybersecurity and regulatory aspects of AI.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the President publicly advocated for federal legislation requiring cybersecurity measures for AI models?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit indication that the President has publicly advocated for federal legislation specifically requiring cybersecurity measures for AI models. The sources detail various executive orders and actions taken by the Biden administration to address AI safety, security, and governance, but they do not mention public advocacy for federal legislation on this topic.\n\n- The sources discuss Executive Order 14110 on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, which outlines various actions and guidelines for federal agencies but does not indicate public advocacy for legislation.\n- They also mention other initiatives and actions taken by the administration, such as the National Security Memorandum on AI and changes to FedRAMP, but again, there is no mention of public advocacy for federal legislation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of today, October 29, 2024, there are approximately **64 days** remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and the end of the year, the outcome would be **No**; the U.S. would not have passed legislation that requires cybersecurity around AI models before 2025.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about **16 days** left until the deadline, I would forecast a probability of **1%** that such legislation would be passed.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **256 days** remaining (extending the deadline by four times to around mid-2025), I would forecast a probability of **30%** that the legislation would be passed.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the limited time remaining until January 1, 2025, and the current legislative landscape, the probability of the U.S. passing federal legislation requiring cybersecurity measures around powerful AI models is low.\n\n- **Congressional Schedule:** The 118th Congress is set to conclude on January 3, 2025. According to the provided information, Congress is not scheduled to be in session before January 1, 2025. This significantly reduces the window for passing new legislation.\n\n- **Pending Legislation:** There are federal bills pending in Congress that address AI cybersecurity, such as the Secure Artificial Intelligence Act of 2024 and the Federal Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Act of 2024. However, these bills are still in the proposal stage and have not advanced to the point of being passed into law.\n\n- **Legislative Process Timing:** Passing federal legislation is a complex process that typically takes months or even years, involving committee reviews, debates, and approvals in both the House and Senate, followed by the President's signature.\n\n- **Executive Actions vs. Legislation:** While the President has issued executive orders related to AI safety and security, these do not constitute legislation passed by Congress. Executive actions cannot fulfill the criteria of the question, which specifies the passage of federal law by the legislative branch.\n\n- **Lack of Immediate Catalysts:** There have been no major recent cybersecurity incidents involving AI models that might prompt swift legislative action. Without a pressing event to accelerate the process, the passage of such specific legislation in the remaining time is unlikely.\n\n- **Bipartisan Support:** Although there is bipartisan interest in AI and cybersecurity, and some bills have progressed through committees, the remaining legislative days are limited, and priorities may lie elsewhere, such as end-of-year budgeting and other pressing matters.\n\nConsidering these factors, while it's not impossible for legislation to be passed in the remaining time, it is highly improbable.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
