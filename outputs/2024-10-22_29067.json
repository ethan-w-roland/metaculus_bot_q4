{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill RCP's polling bias for Trump based on national polls in the month before the 2024 election be greater than or equal to 0 percentage points and less than or equal to 1.0 percentage points?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThe question will resolve as **Yes** if Donald Trump's national polling bias when using the October 17 [RealClear Polling (RCP) average](https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris) of a -1.583 percentage point spread (Trump) is greater than or equal to 0 pp and less than or equal to 1.0 pp. \n\nThis will be calculated as -1.583 percentage points (pp), minus Trump's popular vote percentage (expressed in pp), plus Harris' popular vote percentage (in pp).\n\nBACKGROUND:\nPolling bias is calculated by subtracting the actual voting percentage spread from the pre-election polled percentage spread of the candidate in question. For example, [Activote's](https://www.activote.net/polling-analysis/) national 2020 poll reported Trump trailing Biden by a 6 percentage point spread. The actual election resulted in 51.31% votes for Biden and 46.85% for Trump, a -4.46pp spread. Trump's polling bias was then \\(-6pp-(-4.46pp) = -1.54pp \\).\n\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/2022-election-polling-accuracy/) estimated a polling bias of +4.1pp for the Biden in 2020 and +3.3pp for Clinton in 2016. However, it found almost no weighted-average polling bias in the 2022 midterm election. The \"shy Trump voter hypothesis\" suggests one possible reason for the bias in 2016 and 2020 is that Trump voters were reluctant to respond or respond accurately to the polls. Authors from [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/11/02/shy-trump-voters-myth/), [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2020/11/1/21544644/shy-trump-voters-polling-error-explained), and others have questioned this hypothesis.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the RealClearPolitics (RCP) polling bias for Donald Trump in the month before the 2024 election will be greater than or equal to 0 percentage points and less than or equal to 1.0 percentage points, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context\nIn the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, polls consistently underestimated Donald Trump's support. In 2016, national polls underestimated Trump's performance by 1.1 points, and in 2020, they underestimated it by 2.7 points.\n\n## Recent Trends\nThe 2022 midterms showed a different pattern, where polls actually overestimated Republican performance in some swing states, suggesting a potential pro-Republican bias in those elections. However, this was a midterm election with different voter demographics compared to presidential elections.\n\n## Current Polling Challenges\nPollsters face several challenges, including nonresponse bias, particularly among Trump supporters who are less likely to participate in surveys due to distrust of institutions like pollsters and the media. This bias could be more pronounced in states like Wisconsin and North Carolina, where rural and white, non-college-educated voters are underrepresented in polls.\n\n## Efforts to Improve Polling\nPollsters have made efforts to learn from past mistakes, such as adjusting for turnout estimates and improving sampling methods to include harder-to-reach voters. However, there is still concern about whether these adjustments will be sufficient to avoid the biases seen in previous elections.\n\n## Current Polling Data\nAs of the latest reports, the races in key battleground states are very close, with some polls showing Trump leading by a small margin and others showing Harris ahead. The overall national polls indicate a tight race, with Harris leading by a small margin.\n\n### Uncertainty and Variability\nGiven the historical underestimation of Trump's support and the ongoing challenges in polling methodologies, it is uncertain whether the polling bias will fall within the specified range. The variability in past elections and the different dynamics of each election cycle make it difficult to predict with certainty.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile there are valid reasons to believe that pollsters have learned from past mistakes and are making efforts to improve their methodologies, the historical context and ongoing challenges suggest that the polling bias could still be significant. However, whether the bias will be greater than or equal to 0 percentage points and less than or equal to 1.0 percentage points is not clear based on the available information.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether RCP's polling bias for Trump will be within this range cannot be definitively determined as yes or no without further data and analysis closer to the election.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current RCP national polls in October 2024 showing a smaller polling bias compared to 2020?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is not enough specific information to definitively compare the polling bias of RCP national polls in October 2024 to those in 2020.\n\n- The sources discuss various issues and limitations with polling, including biases and inaccuracies in previous elections, but they do not provide a direct comparison of the polling bias in 2020 versus 2024.\n- The Metaculus question about RCP's polling bias for Trump in 2024 does not include historical data for comparison with 2020.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent elections demonstrated a decrease in polling bias for Republican candidates?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer to whether recent elections have demonstrated a decrease in polling bias for Republican candidates, particularly those involving Donald Trump, is unclear or mixed.\n\n- The sources indicate that polling errors, especially in presidential elections involving Donald Trump, have been significant. For example, in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, polls underestimated Trump's support, leading to large errors, especially at the state level.\n- However, in the midterm elections of 2018 and 2022, when Trump was not on the ballot, polling performed better.\n- There is no clear evidence that the bias against Republican candidates, particularly Trump, has decreased in recent presidential election polling. Instead, the challenges such as partisan nonresponse bias and the difficulty in estimating voter turnout continue to affect polling accuracy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have pollsters successfully adjusted for nonresponse bias among Trump supporters in 2024?\nANSWER: The success of pollsters in adjusting for nonresponse bias among Trump supporters in the 2024 election is still uncertain and subject to several factors.\n\nWhile pollsters have made significant efforts to address the issues of nonresponse bias, particularly by using more comprehensive weighting methods, incorporating voter registration databases, and adjusting for educational demographics, there are indications that these adjustments may not fully mitigate the problem.\n\n- Pollsters have revised their methods to include more variables in weighting, such as past voting behavior and educational levels, to better represent Trump supporters.\n- However, experts acknowledge that despite these improvements, the challenge of engaging Trump supporters who are skeptical of institutions and less likely to participate in polls remains.\n- The effectiveness of these new methods will only be fully understood after the election, as the actual turnout and voting patterns will reveal whether the adjustments were sufficient.\n\nGiven this information, the answer to whether pollsters have successfully adjusted for nonresponse bias among Trump supporters in 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did RCP's national polls in the month before the 2020 election underestimate Trump's support by more than 1.0 percentage points?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is clear that there were significant polling errors in the 2020 election, but the specific magnitude of the error in RCP's national polls needs to be examined closely.\n\nThe Pew Research Center analysis indicates that many 2020 pre-election polls underestimated Trump's support, but it does not specify the exact margin of error for RCP's national polls alone.\n\nHowever, the Newsweek article and other sources suggest that polling errors in 2020 did occur, with some polls underestimating Trump's support. For example, it is mentioned that polling errors similar to those in 2020 could have significant implications, but it does not provide a precise figure for RCP's national polls specifically.\n\nGiven the information available, it is unclear whether RCP's national polls in the month before the 2020 election underestimated Trump's support by more than 1.0 percentage points specifically, as the sources do not provide this level of detail for RCP's polls alone.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does current polling data suggest that Trump's actual support is being captured within a 1.0 percentage point margin in October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether current polling data suggests that Trump's actual support is being captured within a 1.0 percentage point margin in October 2024.\n\nHere are the key points from the sources:\n\n- The polling averages show a closely contested race with varying margins in different states. For example, Trump leads by 1 to 2 points in states like Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, while the race is nearly tied in other swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.\n- There is acknowledgment of the potential for polling inaccuracies, including the possibility that polls may be underestimating or overestimating support for either candidate.\n- The sources do not provide a unified view that the polling margin for Trump's support is consistently within a 1.0 percentage point across all relevant polls.\n\nGiven these points, the data does not definitively indicate that Trump's actual support is captured within a 1.0 percentage point margin.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence that the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon is still affecting polling accuracy in 2024?\nANSWER: The evidence on whether the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon is still affecting polling accuracy in 2024 is mixed and somewhat unclear.\n\n- Some sources suggest that the \"shy Trump voter\" effect may be less significant in 2024. For example, Morning Consult argues that polling methods have improved, particularly by weighting surveys on recalled 2020 vote choice, which might better capture Trump's actual level of support. This implies that the \"shy Trump voter\" effect could be minimized.\n\n- A psychotherapist, Jonathan Alpert, reports that some of his patients are still reluctant to express their support for Trump publicly due to fear of criticism or social consequences, indicating that the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon may still exist to some extent.\n\n- However, Pew Research Center and other studies have found little to no evidence to support the \"shy Trump\" theory in past elections. Instead, they attribute polling errors to other factors such as difficulty in estimating voter turnout and partisan nonresponse bias.\n\nGiven these conflicting perspectives, it is not definitive whether the \"shy Trump voter\" phenomenon is still significantly affecting polling accuracy in 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have efforts to better represent rural and white, non-college-educated voters improved polling accuracy in 2024?\nANSWER: The improvement in polling accuracy for representing rural and white, non-college-educated voters in the 2024 elections is still a subject of ongoing efforts and challenges, but the evidence suggests that while there have been attempts to address these issues, the problems are not yet fully resolved.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the ongoing challenges:\n- Pollsters are adjusting methodologies to better reach these groups, such as using a combination of online, mail, phone outreach, and probability-based panels. However, these methods are not universally adopted, and many public polls still face issues like response bias and underrepresentation of rural and white, non-college-educated voters.\n- The \"shy Trump effect\" and partisan nonresponse bias continue to be concerns, with Republican voters, particularly those in rural and white, working-class demographics, being less likely to participate in polls.\n- While some pollsters are using more nuanced stratification and weighting to correct for these biases, these methods are expensive and not all pollsters can implement them effectively.\n\nGiven these points, it is unclear whether the efforts have significantly improved polling accuracy for these specific voter groups in 2024, as the issues are complex and not fully resolved.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have pollsters made methodological changes since the 2020 election to improve polling accuracy for Trump supporters?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nSince the 2020 election, pollsters have indeed made several methodological changes aimed at improving the accuracy of polling, particularly in representing Trump supporters and other Republican voters.\n\n- Pollsters have been weighting their sample data to better account for the political makeup of the population, including weighting up respondents who voted for Trump in 2020 to address nonresponse bias.\n- There has been an increased use of multiple methods, such as combining online surveys, text messaging, and probability-based panels, to improve the representation of various demographic groups.\n- Efforts have been made to identify and adjust for likely voters more accurately, using approaches like state voter files and turnout models based on past vote history.\n- The American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR) and other polling organizations have highlighted the need to address declining response rates and the politicization of polling, which may have skewed results in favor of Democratic candidates.\n\nThese changes reflect a broader effort to adapt polling methodologies to better capture the opinions and voting intentions of all segments of the electorate, including Trump supporters.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the RCP average polling spread within 1.0 percentage points of other major polling aggregators in October 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if the RCP (RealClearPolitics) average polling spread is within 1.0 percentage points of other major polling aggregators in October 2024, we need to compare the RCP averages with those from other reputable polling aggregators, such as FiveThirtyEight.\n\n## RCP Averages\nThe sources provided do not give a specific RCP average for October 2024, but they do show various polls and their spreads around that time. For example, the spreads in the polls listed vary, but there is no consolidated average given for October specifically.\n\n## FiveThirtyEight Averages\nFiveThirtyEight provides adjusted polling averages that account for recency, sample size, methodology, and house effects. However, the sources do not provide the exact averages for October 2024 from FiveThirtyEight in the text, only a general methodology and some historical data.\n\n## Comparison\nWithout the specific averages for October 2024 from both RCP and FiveThirtyEight, it is impossible to directly compare whether the spreads are within 1.0 percentage points of each other.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data for October 2024 averages in the provided sources, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a significant difference between national and state-level polling biases for Trump in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are indications that the biases and challenges in polling can vary between national and state levels, particularly when considering the context of Trump's candidacy.\n\n## National Polls\nNational polls have historically underestimated Trump's support, but they aim to represent the entire public's opinions. In 2024, pollsters are adjusting their weighting factors, such as education, party affiliation, and past vote, to try to improve accuracy. However, these adjustments may not fully address the biases, especially the partisan nonresponse bias, where Trump supporters might be less likely to participate in polls.\n\n## State-Level Polls\nState-level polls have been particularly problematic, especially in battleground states. In the past, state-level polls have shown larger errors than national polls, often underestimating Trump's support. For example, in 2016 and 2020, state-level polls in crucial battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were less accurate than national polls. This is partly due to the difficulty in estimating turnout and the specific demographic compositions of these states, such as the underrepresentation of rural and non-college-educated voters.\n\n## Differences in Biases\n- **Turnout Estimation**: State-level polls face challenges in predicting who will turn out to vote, especially among irregular voters who tend to support Trump in presidential elections but not in midterms.\n- **Demographic Representation**: State-level polls, particularly in battleground states, have struggled with accurately representing certain demographics, such as rural voters and white, non-college-educated individuals. This can lead to a more pronounced effect of nonresponse bias in these states.\n- **Weighting Factors**: While national polls are adjusting their weighting factors, state-level polls may face unique challenges in applying these adjustments accurately due to the specific electoral contexts of each state.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that there are significant differences between national and state-level polling biases, especially when considering the specific challenges and adjustments being made for the 2024 election.\n\n**YES**", "comment": "**(a)** The time left until the outcome to the question is known is approximately 2 to 3 weeks. The U.S. presidential election is on November 5, 2024, and the national popular vote results are typically finalized within a week or two after Election Day.\n\n---\n\n**(b)** If nothing changed, based on historical polling biases and current polling data, the outcome would likely be that the RCP's polling bias for Trump falls outside the range of greater than or equal to 0 percentage points and less than or equal to 1.0 percentage points. Historically, polls have underestimated Trump's support by more than 1 percentage point in previous presidential elections.\n\n---\n\n**(c)** If there was only a quarter of the time left (about one week), I would forecast a low probability that the polling bias will fall within the specified range, given the limited time for any significant changes in polling methodology or voter behavior.\n\n---\n\n**(d)** If there was 4 times the time left (approximately 8 to 12 weeks), there would be more opportunity for changes in voter sentiment, polling adjustments, or significant events that could affect polling accuracy. However, given historical trends, I would still forecast a moderate probability that the polling bias remains outside the specified range.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Context:** In both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, national polls underestimated Trump's support significantly. In 2016, the national polling error was about 1.1 percentage points, and in 2020, it was approximately 2.7 percentage points. Both instances exceeded the 1.0 percentage point upper limit specified in the question.\n\n- **Polling Bias Trends:** The consistent underestimation of Trump's support suggests systemic issues in polling methodologies when it comes to accurately capturing his voter base. Factors contributing to this include partisan nonresponse bias and difficulties in reaching certain demographics.\n\n- **Adjustments in Polling Methods:** While pollsters have made efforts to adjust their methodologies since 2020\u2014such as better weighting for education, past voting behavior, and efforts to reach underrepresented groups\u2014the effectiveness of these changes remains uncertain. The challenge of accurately polling Trump supporters persists due to factors like distrust in institutions and reluctance to participate in polls.\n\n- **Current Polling Data:** As of October 17, the RCP average shows a spread of -1.583 percentage points for Trump. Given historical polling errors, it's plausible that the actual election results could differ from the polls by more than 1 percentage point.\n\n- **Base Rates:** Considering the past two presidential elections involving Trump, the base rate of the polling bias falling within the 0 to 1.0 percentage point range is low. In both cases, the bias exceeded 1 percentage point.\n\n- **Time Frame:** With only two weeks left until the election, significant methodological changes or shifts in voter sentiment are unlikely. Therefore, the probability of the polling bias falling within the specified range remains low.\n\n- **Uncertainties:** While there's always a chance that improvements in polling could result in more accurate predictions, the consistent challenges faced in previous elections suggest caution in expecting a significant reduction in polling bias for Trump.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**", "probability": 20}
