    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill China's youth unemployment rate be greater than 17.0 and less than or equal to 18.0 for November 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-13\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve based on the youth unemployment rate for November 2024, as reported by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/youth-unemployment-rate), using data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\nThe question will resolve based on the reported youth unemployment rate, rounded to the nearest 0.1 percentage point.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe youth unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force aged 16-24 without work but available for and seeking employment, based on the calculation method used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China as of August 2024.\n\nIf the National Bureau of Statistics of China revises its calculation method or age range for the youth unemployment rate before September 2024, the question will be resolved using the most up-to-date definition and methodology.\n\nIn the event that Trading Economics does not report the youth unemployment rate for August 2024 before October 7, 2024, or if the data is not available from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the question will resolve as \"Annulled\". The data can be found [directly from the NBS here](https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=A01) by selecting \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate\" under \"Indicators\" on the left side and observing the data in the row labeled \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate of the Population Aged from 16 to 24 Excluding Students(%)\".\n\nBACKGROUND:\nChina's youth unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people aged 16 to 24 who are not in school and are unemployed, has been a growing concern for the country's policymakers and economists. In July 2024, the rate [soared to 17.1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/chinas-youth-unemployment-soars-above-17percent-in-july.html), the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December 2023.\n\nThe new calculation method, introduced in late 2023, excludes those who are still in school, as more people in China are pursuing higher education amid a more competitive job market. Under the previous calculation method, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023.\n\nThe rising youth unemployment rate has been attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes in the labor market. As the issue continues to draw attention, this question aims to predict the youth unemployment rate for August 2024, providing insight into the short-term trajectory of this critical economic indicator.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of China's youth unemployment rate being greater than 17.0 and less than or equal to 18.0 for November 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends\n- The youth unemployment rate in China has been volatile, with a recent high of 18.8% in August 2024 and a slight decrease to 17.6% in September 2024[1][4][5].\n\n## Historical Context\n- The rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023 before the data collection method was adjusted to exclude students, which brought the rate down to 14.9% in December 2023[1][3][5].\n\n## Economic Conditions\n- China's economy is experiencing a slowdown, with significant impacts on sectors that typically employ young graduates, such as real estate, finance, and IT. This has led to reduced hiring and increased reluctance among companies to recruit new graduates due to the costs and legal complexities associated with potential layoffs[3][4].\n\n## Seasonal Factors\n- Youth unemployment tends to rise every summer as new graduates enter the job market, which could influence the November rate, although it might start to stabilize as the year progresses[3].\n\n## Projections\n- According to Trading Economics, the youth unemployment rate is expected to be around 18.0% by the end of the quarter, and long-term projections suggest it will trend around 18.5% in 2025 and 18.0% in 2026[5].\n\nGiven these points, while the exact rate for November 2024 is not yet available, the recent trend and economic conditions suggest that the rate could remain in the range of 17.0% to 18.0%. However, this is speculative based on current data, and actual figures could vary.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The average youth unemployment rate in China from 2021 to 2024 has been around 16.68%, but recent months have seen higher rates due to economic conditions[5].\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The resolution of high youth unemployment rates is tied to broader economic recovery and policy interventions, which may take time to implement and show effects.\n\nIn summary, while the question cannot be answered definitively without the actual November data, the current trends and economic context suggest that the youth unemployment rate could plausibly fall within the specified range. However, this is subject to various economic and policy factors that could influence the actual outcome.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is China's most recently reported youth unemployment rate between 17.0% and 18.0%?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe most recently reported youth unemployment rate in China, as of September 2024, is 17.6%, which falls within the range of 17.0% to 18.0%[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is November historically a month when China's youth unemployment rate increases?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication that November is historically a month when China's youth unemployment rate increases.\n\n- The sources mention that youth unemployment in China tends to rise in the summer months, particularly in June and July, when a large number of college graduates enter the job market[2][4].\n- There is no specific mention of November being a month of significant increase in youth unemployment rates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the youth unemployment rate in China previously been within the range of greater than 17.0% and less than or equal to 18.0% in November?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data mentioned for the youth unemployment rate in China for the month of November. The sources provide detailed information on the youth unemployment rates for various months, including September 2024, but do not include November.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the youth unemployment rate in China has previously been within the range of greater than 17.0% and less than or equal to 18.0% in November is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are industries that typically employ young workers in China experiencing downturns?\nANSWER: Yes, industries that typically employ young workers in China are experiencing downturns. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- Industries such as real estate, financial technology, and for-profit education, which are among those that typically recruit young, college-educated workers, have been hurt by new government regulations and economic slowdowns[2][5].\n- The general economic downturn and the collapse of the property and housing market have led to a hiring slowdown, affecting jobs that are most suitable for new labor market entrants[3].\n- Regulatory burdens have dampened growth in industries most likely to employ young people, such as technology[3].\n\nThese factors have contributed to the high youth unemployment rates in China.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is China's overall economic growth slowing down as of November 2024?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nAs of November 2024, several sources indicate that China's overall economic growth is slowing down. Here are the key points:\n\n- China's GDP growth is projected to be 4.8% in 2024, down from the previous forecast of 5.0% and from the 5.2% growth in 2023[1][4][5].\n- The growth momentum has weakened further in recent months, driven by softening investment, declining consumption, and low consumer confidence[1][3].\n- The World Bank forecasts that China's growth rate will drop to 4.3% in 2025, indicating a continued slowdown[4].\n- Despite some temporary boosts from stimulus measures, the underlying structural issues such as weak domestic demand, property market downturn, and slowing infrastructure investment continue to dampen economic activity[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China's youth unemployment rate been increasing in the months leading up to November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the trend of China's youth unemployment rate in the months leading up to November 2024 can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- In July 2024, the youth unemployment rate was 17.1%[3][5].\n- In August 2024, it increased to 18.8%, which was the highest level since the new record-keeping system began in December[3][5][2].\n- In September 2024, the rate decreased to 17.6%[1][4][5].\n\nTherefore, while the rate did increase from July to August, it then decreased in September. So, the rate has not been consistently increasing in the months leading up to November 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as the trend is not consistently increasing)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant external factors, such as global economic issues, affecting China's economy in late 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are significant external factors affecting China's economy in late 2024.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the impact of global economic issues on China's economy:\n\n- Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, are noted as a significant threat to China's economic development. These tensions include trade disputes, technology restrictions, and global economic fragmentation, which can cost the global economy substantially and hinder economic opportunities[1][4].\n\n- Global trade restrictions and tariffs imposed in recent years have affected diplomatic relations between the US and China, potentially harming global economic growth and impacting China's exports and economic recovery[4].\n\n- External demand, especially from Europe, has weakened, contributing to a decline in China's goods exports. This external pressure has added to the economic challenges China is facing[4].\n\n- The global economic environment, including economic fragmentation and increased international trade restrictions, poses significant risks to China's economic growth and stability[1][4].\n\nThese factors indicate that external global economic issues are indeed impacting China's economy in late 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact China's job market for youth in November 2024?\nANSWER: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have lingering effects on China's job market for youth, even as of the latest available information up to November 2024.\n\n- The pandemic's impact on the economy, including a slowdown in industrial production and domestic consumption, has contributed to the high youth unemployment rates[3][4].\n- The structural challenges in the job market, such as the mismatch between the skills of young graduates and available jobs, and the influx of a large number of college graduates into the workforce each year, have been exacerbated by the pandemic[3][4].\n- The pandemic also affected the education system, with remote learning impacting the socialization and job market skills of graduates, which continues to be a challenge[5].\n- Despite some decline in youth unemployment rates since the peak in June 2023, the rates remain high, and the ongoing economic and social challenges are still influenced by the pandemic's aftermath[2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **YES**, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to impact China's job market for youth in November 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent graduates in China faced increased difficulty finding employment in 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nRecent graduates in China have indeed faced significant difficulties in finding employment in 2024. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The youth unemployment rate in China has been exceptionally high, reaching 17.1% in July and 18.8% in August 2024, which is the highest level so far this year[2][3][4].\n- A record 11.79 million college graduates entered the job market in 2024, exacerbating the competition and making it harder for them to find jobs[1][2][3].\n- Many graduates are forced to accept low-paying jobs or rely on their parents' pensions due to the lack of better job opportunities[1][2][3].\n- The job market has been weakened by declines in former growth sectors such as internet companies, education, and real estate, leading to reduced hiring and increased layoffs[2][3][4].\n- Despite having strong academic backgrounds and internships, many graduates have faced months of job hunting with little success[3][4].\n\nThese factors collectively indicate that recent graduates in China are facing increased difficulty in finding employment in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent government policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment in China?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nRecent government policies in China have indeed been aimed at reducing youth unemployment. Here are some key initiatives:\n\n- The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, along with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance, introduced a policy to encourage employers to hire fresh college graduates and registered unemployed youth by offering a one-time allowance of 1,500 yuan ($207) for each young person hired until the end of December 2023[2][3].\n- A 100-day campaign was launched in June 2023 to find 10 million jobs for college graduates and job seekers, and another campaign aimed to help unemployed youth find jobs through various support services such as career guidance, job recommendations, and skill training courses[2][3].\n- The central government issued a 24-point plan in 2024 to promote high-quality and full employment, which includes measures such as pushing universities to align their programs with job market needs, eliminating degree programs with low employment quality, and requiring companies to invest more in staff training[4].\n- Policies also include providing subsidies to college graduates who have not found a job within two years of graduation to help them pay for social insurance, and encouraging businesses to prioritize lifelong vocational training[4].",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nApproximately one month. The youth unemployment rate for November 2024 is expected to be reported in December 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf the rate remained at the most recent value of 17.6%, the outcome would fall within the specified range (>17.0% and ≤18.0%). Therefore, the question would resolve as \"Yes\".\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith less time remaining, and assuming current trends persist, I would increase my confidence that the youth unemployment rate will stay within the specified range.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith more time until the outcome is known (approximately four months), there is greater uncertainty due to potential economic changes or policy interventions that could significantly impact the unemployment rate.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of September 2024, China's youth unemployment rate is reported at 17.6%. Recent months have shown fluctuations, peaking at 18.8% in August before decreasing. Several factors influence the likelihood of the rate staying within the specified range for November:\n\n- **Seasonal Trends:** Youth unemployment in China often rises during summer months when new graduates enter the job market and tends to stabilize or decrease towards the end of the year.\n\n- **Economic Conditions:** China's economy is experiencing a slowdown, affecting industries that typically employ young workers. However, no significant economic shifts are expected within the next month that would drastically alter unemployment figures.\n\n- **Government Policies:** The Chinese government has implemented measures to reduce youth unemployment, including incentives for companies to hire recent graduates. These policies may contribute to a gradual decrease in the unemployment rate.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's reasonable to anticipate that the youth unemployment rate for November 2024 will remain close to the current rate. While slight variations are possible, significant changes are unlikely within the short time frame.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 70%**",
