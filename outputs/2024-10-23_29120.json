{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the 500th richest person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index have $6.5 billion or more on Monday December 30, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-23\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 500th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) has a net worth of $6.50B or greater when accessed by Metaculus Admins on December 30, 2024, after 5:00 PM Eastern Time (i.e., over an hour after  the US stock market closes for regular trading). \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nFor purposes of this question, the 500th-ranked or 500th-richest person on the list is considered to be the poorest person on the list. Therefore if the list contains fewer than 500 people on December 30, 2024, it will resolve based on the poorest person on the list. If the list contains more than 500 people, it will resolve based on the 500th-ranked person. \n\nIf Bloomberg's Billionaires Index is unavailable on December 30, 2024, resolution will wait until it is available (at which point it resolves based on the data shown), until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled. For more details on various edge cases regarding availability of or changes to the resolution source, please see Metaculus's ambiguity and annulment policies [here](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#ambiguous-annulled). \n\nAdmins resolving this question will not round up. For example., $6.5000B would count, but $6.4999B would not.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Bloomberg:\n\n>The Bloomberg Billionaires Index is a daily ranking of the world\u2019s richest people. Details about the calculations are provided in the net worth analysis on each billionaire\u2019s profile page. The figures are updated at the close of every trading day in New York.\n\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the 500th richest person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index will have $6.5 billion or more on Monday, December 30, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Dynamic Nature of the Index\nThe Bloomberg Billionaires Index is updated daily based on changes in stock prices, economic conditions, and other market factors. This means that the ranking and net worth of individuals can fluctuate significantly over short periods.\n\n## Current Trends and Volatility\nAs of recent updates, the net worth of individuals on the index can change rapidly due to various factors such as stock performance, economic news, and other financial events. For example, Donald Trump's net worth recently surged due to the performance of his media startup's stock.\n\n## Historical Context and Base Rates\nThe index has a history of uncovering and tracking hidden wealth, and it has expanded to include 500 billionaires since its inception in 2012. The total net worth of the individuals on the list is substantial, but the threshold for the 500th position can vary. As of the latest data, the net worth required to be among the top 500 can fluctuate, but it generally tends to be in the billions of dollars.\n\n## Specific Case - Donald Trump\nAs of October 22, 2024, Donald Trump's net worth was $6.5 billion, placing him at the 481st position. This indicates that individuals around the 500th position could potentially have net worths in the range of $6.5 billion or slightly lower, depending on market conditions.\n\n## Predictive Challenges\nGiven the daily updates and the volatile nature of the stock market, predicting the exact net worth of the 500th richest person on a specific date (December 30, 2024) is challenging. The net worth can be influenced by numerous factors, including stock market performance, economic conditions, and other financial events that may occur between now and then.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is possible for the 500th richest person to have $6.5 billion or more on December 30, 2024, the answer is not immediately clear due to the dynamic and volatile nature of the index. The actual net worth will depend on various market and economic factors that will unfold over the next few weeks.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the number of people listed on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index remained at 500 over the past year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the number of people listed on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index has changed from 500 over the past year. The sources consistently mention that the index tracks the 500 wealthiest people in the world without any recent adjustments to this number.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the net worth threshold for the 500th richest person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index increased over the past year?\nANSWER: The information provided does not specify the exact net worth threshold for the 500th richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the past year or any changes to this threshold. The sources discuss various individuals' net worth and rankings but do not provide a comparison of the threshold value over time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the net worth of the person ranked 500th on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index currently less than $6.5 billion?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specify the exact net worth of the person ranked 500th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The information given includes details about the top-ranked individuals and the methodology used to calculate net worth, but it does not provide the net worth of the 500th person on the list.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump's net worth decreased over the past month?\nANSWER: Yes, Donald Trump's net worth has decreased over the past month. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- Trump's net worth has dropped by an estimated $900 million since Kamala Harris entered the presidential race, primarily due to the decline in the value of his stake in Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social.\n- The value of Trump's stake in TMTG has plummeted from around $4 billion to about $2 billion, reflecting a significant decline in the company's stock price.\n\nThese declines are attributed to various factors, including the changing political landscape, poor financial performance of Truth Social, and the impending end of the lock-up period for insider shares.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major stock market indices, such as the S&P 500, declined over the past month?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the performance of the S&P 500 over the past month can be determined as follows:\n\n- The S&P 500 Index rebounded in September 2024, delivering a positive return after an initial decline. It gained +2.1% for the month, outperforming small caps.\n- As of October 21, 2024, the S&P 500 had closed at record highs on the previous Friday but opened slightly lower on Monday, October 21. However, this does not indicate a decline over the entire month of October, but rather a short-term fluctuation.\n\nGiven this information, it appears that the S&P 500 did not decline over the past month; instead, it showed resilience and positive returns.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the net worth threshold for the 500th richest person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index increased by more than $500 million over the past year?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not specify the exact net worth threshold for the 500th richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index for the current or the previous year. While the sources provide information on the index's methodology and some of the top billionaires' net worth, they do not offer the specific data needed to determine if the threshold for the 500th richest person has increased by more than $500 million over the past year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do economic forecasts predict a significant stock market decline before December 30, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no clear indication of a significant stock market decline predicted before December 30, 2024.\n\n- The IBRC forecast suggests that while there are risks and negative fundamentals, the overall expectation is for stocks to be \"flat to slightly higher\" in 2024, with no specific mention of a significant decline before the end of the year.\n- J.P. Morgan's outlook does not predict a significant stock market decline; instead, it discusses the potential for rate cuts and their positive impact on the market.\n- Deloitte's forecast also does not indicate a significant decline, focusing on the expectation of rate cuts and their positive effects on consumer spending and the economy.\n- The Conference Board's forecast similarly does not suggest a significant decline, highlighting ongoing resilience in the US economy despite some uncertainties.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the total wealth of the top 500 billionaires increased over the past year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the total wealth of the top billionaires has indeed increased over the past few years, including the recent period.\n\n- The Oxfam report mentions that the wealth of the world's five richest men has more than doubled since 2020, and billionaires as a whole have seen their wealth grow by $3.3 trillion, or 34%, since 2020.\n- Specifically, the report notes that in the year leading up to June 2023, the top corporations, many of which are associated with billionaires, made nearly $1.8 trillion in profits, a 52.5% increase compared to the average between 2018 and 2021.\n- Another source indicates that the total net worth of U.S. billionaires has continued to rise, with an increase from $2.947 trillion on March 18, 2020, to $3.917 trillion as of September 3, 2023.\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that the total wealth of the top billionaires has increased over the past year.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are any major economic events expected before December 30, 2024, that could negatively impact billionaire net worths?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several economic events scheduled before December 30, 2024, but it is unclear whether any of these events will necessarily negatively impact billionaire net worths. Here are some of the key economic events listed:\n\n## Economic Indicators and Reports\n- Initial Jobless Claims, Retail Sales, Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index, Industrial Production, and Business Inventories are scheduled for various dates in October and November.\n- Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), and other inflation-related metrics are also scheduled, which can influence economic stability and potentially impact wealth.\n- Employment Situation, Global Supply Chain Pressure Index, and New York Fed Staff Nowcast are other significant reports that could have broader economic implications.\n\n## Potential Impact\nWhile these events can provide insights into the economic health and stability of the country, their direct impact on billionaire net worths would depend on various factors such as the specific sectors in which these billionaires have investments, the overall market reaction to the data, and other global economic conditions.\n\nGiven the information available, it is **UNCLEAR** whether these events will negatively impact billionaire net worths, as the outcome depends on multiple variables and the sources provided do not predict the specific impact on individual wealth.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the net worth of the poorest person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index generally higher at the end of the year compared to earlier in the year?\nANSWER: The question of whether the net worth of the poorest person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index is generally higher at the end of the year compared to earlier in the year cannot be definitively answered with the provided sources.\n\nThe sources provide information on the overall trends and increases in the wealth of the world's richest people, such as the significant gains in wealth for the top billionaires and the collective wealth of the 500 richest individuals. However, they do not specifically address the net worth trends of the poorest individuals on the list.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is **UNCLEAR**.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 68 days (from October 23, 2024, to December 30, 2024).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If nothing changed, and assuming current conditions persist, the 500th richest person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index would have a net worth less than $6.5 billion on December 30, 2024. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With about 17 days left, there would be limited opportunity for significant changes in net worth. I would forecast a low probability, around **25%**.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:** With approximately 272 days remaining, there would be more time for economic growth and potential increases in net worth. I would forecast a higher probability, around **65%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n- **Donald Trump's Net Worth:** As of October 22, 2024, Donald Trump is ranked 481st with a net worth of $6.5 billion.\n- **500th Richest Person's Net Worth:** It is reasonable to infer that the 500th richest person has a net worth slightly below $6.5 billion, given Trump's position at 481st.\n\n**Factors Influencing Net Worth Changes:**\n\n1. **Stock Market Performance:**\n   - Major stock indices like the S&P 500 have not declined over the past month and are showing resilience.\n   - Economic forecasts do not predict a significant market decline before December 30, 2024.\n   - Steady or improving markets could increase billionaires' net worths.\n\n2. **Economic Growth:**\n   - The total wealth of the top 500 billionaires has increased over the past year.\n   - No major economic events are expected that could negatively impact billionaire net worths significantly before the resolution date.\n\n3. **Time Frame:**\n   - With approximately two months remaining, there is limited time for substantial net worth changes.\n   - Significant shifts in rankings and net worth typically require more prolonged economic trends or major company events (e.g., IPOs, acquisitions).\n\n4. **Base Rates and Historical Trends:**\n   - Billionaires' net worths tend to increase over time due to economic growth and investments.\n   - Year-end periods can sometimes see increased economic activity, potentially boosting net worths.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the above factors, there is a moderate chance that the net worth of the 500th richest person will reach $6.5 billion or more by December 30, 2024. The limited time frame reduces the likelihood of significant changes, but steady economic conditions and historical trends of wealth growth among billionaires provide a reasonable basis for some probability above zero.\n\n**Probability: 40%**", "probability": 40}
