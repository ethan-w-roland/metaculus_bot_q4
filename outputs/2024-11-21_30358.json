    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill lithium carbonate (CNY/T) prices continuously remain above 70,000 before December 21, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the lithium carbonate (CNY/T) price, as reported by Trading Economics, remains above 70,000, for every day's closing price, after the launch of this question, and through December 20, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe question will resolve as \"No\" if the lithium carbonate price closes at or below 70,000 CNY/T during the specified time period.\n\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to TradingEconomics: \"Lithium carbonated rose to CNY 79,000 per tonne after having traded near the three-year low of CNY 71,000 through late October, benefiting from supply curbs and an uptick in demand. The Chinese government enacted subsidies allowing people to trade older cars for electric vehicles in their latest push to support the sector, raising expectations that battery manufacturers may soon begin restocking lithium inputs. Despite relatively high stocks from a historical standpoint, battery manufacturers also reportedly raised purchasing activity amid risks of a trade war after Trump assumes office next year in the US. In turn, the plunge in prices during the year drove multiple mines in Australia and China to close or cut costs, resulting in 190 tons of lithium mine curtailments since 2023.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether lithium carbonate prices will continuously remain above 70,000 CNY/T before December 21, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Prices and Trends\n- As of late October 2024, lithium carbonate prices in China have been around 79,000 CNY/T, but they have been trending downward due to oversupply and weaker demand, especially from the electric vehicle (EV) sector[2][3][4].\n- Despite a brief rebound, prices have been under pressure, with a significant drop from the beginning of 2024. For example, lithium carbonate prices decreased by 18.08% since the start of 2024[2].\n\n## Forecast and Projections\n- Trading Economics forecasts suggest that lithium carbonate prices are expected to trade at around 71,390.75 CNY/T by the end of the current quarter. This indicates a potential continuation of prices below or around the 70,000 CNY/T mark[2].\n- Analysts from S&P Global Commodity Insights and other sources suggest that prices may remain in a tight range until 2026, with no substantial recovery expected until 2028[1][3].\n\n## Market Dynamics\n- The lithium market is currently facing challenges due to oversupply, high inventories, and slower-than-expected uptake in EV markets outside of China. This oversupply situation is likely to keep prices under pressure[1][3][4].\n\nGiven these points, while prices are currently above 70,000 CNY/T, the forecasts and market dynamics suggest that maintaining prices continuously above this level until December 21, 2024, is uncertain. The expected trading range and the ongoing downward trend make it plausible that prices could dip below 70,000 CNY/T before the end of the year.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether lithium carbonate prices will continuously remain above 70,000 CNY/T before December 21, 2024, is not clearly yes, and there is significant uncertainty involved.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current lithium carbonate inventory levels higher than the five-year average?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the information about current lithium carbonate inventory levels relative to the five-year average is not explicitly stated. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The sources discuss the fluctuations in lithium prices and the impact of demand and supply, but they do not provide a direct comparison of current inventory levels to the five-year average[2][4].\n- It is mentioned that in 2023, battery makers took the opportunity to destock inventories, which caused lithium prices to fall, but this does not specify whether the current inventory levels are higher or lower than the five-year average[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Chinese government introduced new subsidies supporting the lithium carbonate market in 2024?\nANSWER: The Chinese government has introduced some subsidies related to the electric vehicle (EV) market in 2024, but these subsidies are not directly aimed at supporting the lithium carbonate market.\n\n- The government increased subsidies for trade-ins for new energy vehicles (NEVs), where consumers trading in old NEVs or internal combustion engine vehicles could receive a subsidy of 20,000 yuan when purchasing a new NEV. However, these subsidies are more focused on boosting NEV sales rather than directly supporting the lithium carbonate market[2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an ongoing trade war affecting lithium carbonate exports or imports in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is speculation and preparatory actions that suggest a potential trade war, but it is not explicitly stated that an ongoing trade war is currently affecting lithium carbonate exports or imports in 2024.\n\n- The sources mention that Chinese battery makers may be stockpiling lithium ahead of a likely trade war following Donald Trump’s election win, indicating anticipation of trade tensions but not an ongoing trade war[1][2][3].\n- The White House fact sheet discusses President Biden's actions to protect American workers and businesses from China’s unfair trade practices, including increases in tariffs on various sectors, but this does not specifically indicate an ongoing trade war in 2024[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current closing price of lithium carbonate above 70,000 CNY per tonne?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe current closing price of lithium carbonate is above 70,000 CNY per tonne. As of November 20, 2024, the price was reported at 79,050 CNY per tonne[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major lithium carbonate mines in Australia or China reduced their production in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the relevant details:\n\n## Australia:\n- Some Australian lithium producers have indeed taken steps to reduce or adjust their production due to the current market conditions. For example, Core Lithium has put operations at the Grants open-pit mine and the BP33 underground project on hold due to a weakening outlook for lithium prices[2].\n- Albemarle shut half of its current processing capacity in Australia and put expansion there on hold due to the deepening price decline[4].\n- Mineral Resources is reducing lithium production to avoid oversupplying the market[3].\n\n## China:\n- Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (CATL) suspended its lithium lepidolite operation at a Jiangxi mine, which is expected to cut China’s monthly lithium carbonate output by 8% and help rebalance the supply with demand[4].\n\nGiven these details, it is clear that major lithium carbonate mines in both Australia and China have reduced their production in 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has demand for lithium carbonate from the electric vehicle sector declined in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the demand for lithium carbonate from the electric vehicle (EV) sector has not necessarily declined in absolute terms, but it has slowed down compared to previous years.\n\n- The sources indicate that while EV sales are still growing, the growth rate has slowed. For example, global electric car registrations grew by 35% in 2023, which is a notable slowdown compared to the 82% growth in 2022[2][5].\n- Despite this slowdown, the EV sector remains a significant driver of lithium demand. The IEA forecasts that global electric car sales could hit 17 million units by the end of 2024, up from 14 million in 2023[2].\n- The demand for lithium from EV batteries is still increasing, but at a slower pace. Battery demand for lithium stood at around 140 kt in 2023, which is up more than 30% compared to 2022, though the growth rate has slowed[3].\n\nTherefore, while the growth in demand has slowed, it has not declined in absolute terms.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as the question asks for a decline in demand, which is not the case; instead, the growth rate has slowed).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do financial forecasts predict lithium carbonate prices will stay above 70,000 CNY per tonne through December 21, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that lithium carbonate prices are expected to remain significantly below 70,000 CNY per tonne through the end of 2024.\n\n- According to Fastmarkets, the price range for lithium carbonate in China is expected to be around 73,000 yuan per tonne in October, but this is already a decline and not expected to rise above 70,000 CNY per tonne consistently[2].\n- S&P Global Commodity Insights forecasts suggest that lithium carbonate prices will stay between $9,924 and $11,627 per metric ton until 2026, which translates to a much lower price in CNY per tonne than 70,000[2][4].\n- FitchSolutions BMI also forecasts that lithium carbonate prices will average $15,500 per tonne in 2024, far below the 70,000 CNY per tonne mark when converted[3].\n\nThese forecasts indicate that the prices will not stay above 70,000 CNY per tonne through December 21, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent disruptions in the lithium carbonate supply chain that could impact prices?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent disruptions and factors affecting the lithium carbonate supply chain that could impact prices.\n\n1. **Project Delays and Commissioning Issues**: Several lithium projects originally scheduled for commissioning in 2022 were delayed to 2023, and similar delays are anticipated for 2023 projects. This has contributed to market tightness and potential deficits[1].\n\n2. **Oversupply and Market Dynamics**: Despite the increase in lithium supply, the market is facing an oversupply issue in 2024, which has led to bearish sentiment and weak demand. This oversupply, coupled with sluggish demand, is expected to keep prices low[3][4].\n\n3. **Geopolitical and Macroeconomic Factors**: The lithium market is exposed to economic headwinds, geopolitical developments, and trade tensions, which can disrupt supply chains and impact prices. For example, China's export license requirements can control the supply and price of key minerals[2].\n\n4. **Production Cuts and Cost Considerations**: Some producers may choose to reduce production or delay expansions due to the current price environment, which can affect the overall supply and pricing stability[3].\n\n5. **Regional Supply Shifts**: The increasing supply from Africa, particularly from Chinese producers operating in the region, is adding pressure to the oversupply market and influencing the pricing dynamics of lithium carbonate[4].\n\nThese factors collectively indicate that there are indeed recent disruptions and challenges in the lithium carbonate supply chain that could impact prices.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has lithium carbonate experienced a continuous price decrease since January 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, lithium carbonate has experienced a continuous price decrease since January 2024.\n\n- The price of lithium carbonate in China has been in a downtrend, falling from 230,000 yuan/ton to around 100,000 yuan/ton over nearly a year, with a continued decline observed in the second quarter of 2024 due to increased supply and decreased demand[1][2][4].\n- Specifically, the second quarter of 2024 saw a continuous decline in lithium carbonate prices in China, attributed to the rise in supply and slowdown in demand[2].\n- Global lithium carbonate prices have also been under pressure, with a significant decline from over $80,000 per ton in December 2022 to around $13,000 per ton as of January 2024, and this downward trend has continued into 2024[4].\n\nThese sources consistently indicate a sustained downward price trend for lithium carbonate since the beginning of 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has global lithium carbonate supply increased significantly in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the global lithium carbonate supply has increased significantly in 2024.\n\n- According to the SMM statistics, the global lithium carbonate production capacity is expected to exceed 2 million tons in 2024, up from around 1.54 million tons in 2023. The global lithium resource supply is projected to reach around 1.3 million tons of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2024, a 28% increase compared to 2023[1].\n- The global lithium industry has delivered significant growth in reserves and resources, with global lithium production increasing substantially. For instance, the production capacity is expected to increase, and some companies like Albemarle have announced plans to raise their production quotas[2].\n- Additionally, the USGS report notes that established lithium operations worldwide have increased or are in the process of increasing production capacity, contributing to the overall increase in global lithium supply[4].\n\nThese sources collectively indicate a significant increase in the global lithium carbonate supply in 2024.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \n1 month (from November 21, 2024, to December 20, 2024).\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends continue without any significant changes, lithium carbonate prices are expected to gradually decline. Based on forecasts, prices might approach approximately 71,390.75 CNY/T by the end of the current quarter. This scenario suggests that prices could hover just above the 70,000 CNY/T threshold, but maintaining a consistent position above 70,000 CNY/T would be challenging.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 7 days):**  \nIn a shorter timeframe of about a week, prices may experience volatility. Given the existing downward pressure from oversupply and sluggish demand, there is a moderate chance that prices could dip below 70,000 CNY/T within this period. However, significant sustained declines in such a short span are less likely without new market shocks.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left (4 months):**  \nExtending the timeframe to four months introduces greater uncertainty. Over a longer period, additional factors such as geopolitical developments, changes in EV demand, or supply chain disruptions could further influence prices. However, the existing bearish trends suggest that the likelihood of prices remaining above 70,000 CNY/T decreases over an extended period.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nCurrent lithium carbonate prices in China are approximately 79,000 CNY/T but have been on a declining trend since the beginning of 2024. Forecasts predict prices nearing 71,390.75 CNY/T by the end of the quarter, which is marginally above the 70,000 CNY/T threshold. Market dynamics, including increased global supply, reduced production from major mines, and slower EV sector growth, exert downward pressure on prices. While there is some momentum keeping prices above 70,000 CNY/T in the short term, the persistent bearish factors make it uncertain whether this level can be maintained consistently over the next month.\n\n**Probability:** 35%",
