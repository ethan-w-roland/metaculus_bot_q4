    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort be listed as Open by On the Snow's Ski Report on December 8, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-13\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if On the Snow's Hudson Bay Mountain Snow Report, currently located [here](https://www.onthesnow.com/british-columbia/hudson-bay-mountain/skireport), reports the ski resort's operating status as Open when accessed by Metaculus on or after December 8, 2024. If it is reported as Closed, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. In case of the resolution source being down, Metaculus Admins will wait until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn 2023 a [historic drought](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/el-nino-drought-bc-interior-ski-hills-1.7043016) caused [delays](https://www.interior-news.com/local-news/lack-of-snow-forces-hudson-bay-mountain-resort-to-delay-opening-7116185) in opening.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort will be listed as open by OnTheSnow's Ski Report on December 8, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Planned Opening Date\nThe ski and snowboard season at Hudson Bay Mountain is planned to start on December 7, 2024[4].\n\n## Snow Conditions and Accumulation\nAs of the current date (November 13, 2024), the snow tables are active and accumulating snow, with a total of 105 cm of snowfall accumulated for the season so far. The forecast indicates additional snowfall is expected in the coming days, with 4 inches of fresh snow predicted over the next two days and a total of 7 inches over the next seven days[3].\n\n## Operational Preparations\nThe snow tables will continue to accumulate snow until near the planned opening day, after which they will be cleared daily. This suggests that the resort is preparing for the upcoming season and is likely to open as scheduled[4].\n\n## Weather and Snow Forecast\nThe weather forecast indicates continued snowfall and cooler temperatures, which are favorable conditions for opening the ski resort on time[1][3].\n\nGiven these points, it is highly likely that Hudson Bay Mountain will be listed as open by OnTheSnow's Ski Report on December 8, 2024, assuming there are no unforeseen delays or significant changes in weather conditions that would prevent the resort from opening as planned.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Ski resorts typically adhere to their planned opening dates if snow conditions and other preparations are favorable.\n- The current snow accumulation and forecasted snowfall support the likelihood of the resort opening on schedule.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The planned opening date is just a few weeks away, and the current preparations and weather forecasts suggest that the resort is on track to meet this date.\n\nWhile it is not possible to provide a definitive \"yes\" without direct confirmation from the resort, the available information strongly suggests that Hudson Bay Mountain will be open by December 8, 2024.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort confirmed its planned opening date as December 7, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort has confirmed its planned opening date as December 7, 2024. This is stated in multiple sources, including the Hudson Bay Mountain Weather page[1], the Town and Country Today article[2], and the SnowSeekers article[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the OnTheSnow website currently operational and updating ski resort statuses regularly?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe OnTheSnow website is currently operational and updates ski resort statuses regularly. Here are some indicators of this:\n\n- The website provides daily updates on open ski resorts, snow totals, and other relevant information[1].\n- It offers real-time operational alerts, lift and terrain status, and other dynamic updates through its website and app[3][5].\n- The site also includes long-range winter forecasts and projected opening dates, indicating active maintenance and updates[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort announced any delays or cancellations for the upcoming season?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any delays or cancellations for the upcoming 2024/25 season at Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort. The sources discuss the current and forecasted snow conditions, as well as general information about the resort, but do not indicate any delays or cancellations for the upcoming season[1][3][5].\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any indication that OnTheSnow will not update Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort's status accurately on December 8, 2024?\nANSWER: There is no indication from the provided sources that OnTheSnow will not update Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort's status accurately on December 8, 2024. The sources suggest that snow reports and ski conditions are updated daily during the ski season, and there is no mention of any issues or exceptions that would affect the accuracy of these updates once the resort opens on December 7, 2024[2][5].\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OnTheSnow accurately reported the operating status of Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort in previous seasons?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not contain historical data or evaluations of OnTheSnow's accuracy in reporting the operating status of Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort in previous seasons. They only provide current and projected information for the 2024/25 season.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any known operational issues at Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort that could delay its opening for the 2024-2025 season?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no known operational issues at Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort that could delay its opening for the 2024-2025 season. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The ski hill is planning to open on December 7, 2024, and there are already preparations and snow accumulation in progress[4][5].\n- There is a possibility of an earlier opening for the T-bar on the weekend of November 30th and December 1st, depending on snow conditions[5].\n\nNo operational issues or delays are mentioned in the sources. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort typically open on schedule in early December based on historical data?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Hudson Bay Mountain is scheduled to open on December 7, 2024, which is consistent across all the sources[2][3][5].\n\nHowever, the question asks about historical data and whether the resort typically opens on schedule. The sources provided do not offer historical data on the consistency of Hudson Bay Mountain's opening dates. They only provide projected opening dates for the 2024-25 season and note that actual opening dates can be subject to change due to weather and other conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Hudson Bay Mountain typically opens on schedule in early December based on historical data is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the weather forecast favorable for continued snowfall at Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort leading up to December 8, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- The current weather forecast for Hudson Bay Mountain indicates significant snowfall in the immediate future. For example, on November 13, 2024, there is a forecast of 3-4 inches of new snow, and over the next 48 hours, an additional 5 inches of snow is expected[2].\n- The long-range forecast suggests continued snowfall throughout the week, with new snow expected on several days leading up to the end of November[2].\n- The snow history and long-range weather forecasts also suggest that mid- to late November is typically one of the snowiest periods for Hudson Bay Mountain[4][5].\n\nGiven this information, the weather forecast appears to be favorable for continued snowfall at Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort leading up to December 8, 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there currently sufficient snow accumulation at Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort to support opening on December 7, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available information, here are the key points to consider:\n\n- As of November 7, 2024, the total snow accumulation for the upcoming ski and snowboard season at Hudson Bay Mountain was 105 cm (or approximately 41.3 inches)[3].\n- The snow forecast indicates additional snowfall is expected over the next few days, with predictions of up to 4 inches (about 10 cm) of fresh snow in the next 48 hours and more snow forecasted in the following days[4].\n\nWhile the current snow accumulation is significant, the decision to open the ski resort on December 7, 2024, would depend on various factors including the total snow depth, snow conditions, and other operational considerations.\n\nGiven the current snow accumulation and the forecasted additional snow, it appears there is a good chance of sufficient snow for the planned opening. However, without specific details on the minimum required snow depth for opening or other operational criteria, we cannot definitively say it is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as we do not have all the necessary information to confirm whether the current and forecasted snow accumulation meets the specific requirements for opening the ski resort on December 7, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any regional events or restrictions that could impact the opening of Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort on December 7, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are a few factors and events that could potentially impact the opening of Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort on December 7, 2024:\n\n1. **Weather Conditions**: The opening date is dependent on snow conditions. If the snow does not accumulate as expected, the resort might not open on the scheduled date. The ski hill manager mentioned that they will try to open the T-bar the weekend before the scheduled opening date if the snow permits[1][2][4].\n\n2. **Event Scheduling**: While the resort has several events planned for the season, such as the Steelhead Slalom and the U14 provincials, these events are scheduled for later in the season and do not directly impact the opening date[1].\n\nThere are no specific regional events or restrictions mentioned in the sources that would directly impact the opening of Hudson Bay Mountain on December 7, 2024, other than the weather conditions.\n\n**YES**, there are potential factors (primarily weather conditions) that could impact the opening.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: 25 days (from November 13, 2024, to December 8, 2024).\n\n(b) **If nothing changed**, the outcome would be that Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort is listed as **Open** by OnTheSnow on December 8, 2024.\n\n(c) **If there was only a quarter of the time left** (approximately 6 days remaining), I would forecast a higher probability due to reduced time for unforeseen events, perhaps around **95%**.\n\n(d) **If there was 4x the time left** (approximately 100 days remaining), I would forecast a slightly lower probability due to increased uncertainty over a longer period, perhaps around **80%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Current Status and Preparations**:\n   - Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort is scheduled to open on **December 7, 2024**, as confirmed by multiple sources.\n   - Snow accumulation is substantial, with **105 cm** of snowfall already recorded for the season.\n   - The resort is actively preparing for the season, with snow tables accumulating snow and plans to clear them daily near the opening date.\n\n2. **Weather Forecast**:\n   - The weather forecast is favorable, indicating continued snowfall leading up to the opening date.\n   - Predictions include **4 inches of fresh snow** over the next two days and a total of **7 inches** over the next seven days.\n   - Cooler temperatures are expected, which is conducive to maintaining snow conditions.\n\n3. **Operational Considerations**:\n   - There are **no known operational issues** or delays announced by the resort.\n   - Past delays, such as the historic drought in 2023, were due to exceptional circumstances not currently present.\n   - The resort is considering an **earlier opening** for the T-bar if conditions permit, indicating confidence in current preparations.\n\n4. **OnTheSnow Reporting**:\n   - OnTheSnow is operational and **updates ski resort statuses regularly**.\n   - There is no indication that OnTheSnow will fail to report the resort's status accurately on December 8, 2024.\n\n5. **Potential Risks**:\n   - **Weather Variability**: Unforeseen weather events, such as a sudden warm spell or unexpected lack of snowfall, could impact snow conditions.\n   - **Operational Delays**: Last-minute operational issues, though there are currently no signs of such problems.\n   - **Reporting Delays**: Unlikely, but if OnTheSnow experiences technical issues, it could affect the reporting, though contingencies are mentioned in the resolution criteria.\n\n6. **Time Frame Considerations**:\n   - With **25 days** remaining, there is sufficient time for potential risks to materialize, though current trends are positive.\n   - If the time frame were shorter (**6 days**), the probability increases due to less time for adverse events.\n   - If the time frame were longer (**100 days**), uncertainty increases, reducing the probability slightly.\n\n7. **Base Rates and Historical Data**:\n   - While specific historical opening consistency data for Hudson Bay Mountain is unclear, ski resorts generally aim to open as scheduled when conditions allow.\n   - Given the proactive measures by the resort and favorable conditions, it's reasonable to expect adherence to the planned opening date.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nConsidering the favorable snow conditions, positive weather forecasts, active preparations by the resort, and reliable reporting by OnTheSnow, the probability is high that Hudson Bay Mountain ski resort will be listed as **Open** by OnTheSnow on December 8, 2024. Accounting for some residual uncertainty due to unforeseen events, I estimate the probability at **90%**.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 90%**",
