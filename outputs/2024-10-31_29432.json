    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Donald Trump outperform Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee in the 2024 election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-31\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald Trump receives more votes in the 2024 presidential race in the state of Tennessee than Marsha Blackburn receives in the Senatorial race in that state. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Senate Republican candidates are trailing Donald Trump](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/15/senate-election-trump-republicans/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Donald Trump will outperform Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee in the 2024 election, here are some key points from the available data:\n\n## Polling Data\n- According to the Beacon Center polls, Donald Trump has a significant lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in Tennessee, with a 21-point margin.\n- Marsha Blackburn, the incumbent U.S. Senator, also has a substantial lead in her Senate race, with a 23-point lead over her Democratic challenger, Gloria Johnson.\n\n## Voter Sentiment\n- Trump's lead in Tennessee is robust, with 34% of Tennesseans more likely to vote for him despite his recent conviction, and only 22% less likely.\n- Blackburn's approval rating is at 53%, her highest to date, indicating strong support for her among Tennessee voters.\n\n## Comparative Performance\n- While both Trump and Blackburn are leading in their respective races, the polls do not suggest that Trump's performance is significantly better than Blackburn's in terms of voter support. Both candidates have substantial leads, but they are running in different types of elections (presidential vs. senatorial).\n\nGiven this information, it is not clear whether Trump will outperform Blackburn in terms of raw vote percentage or margin of victory, as the polls primarily focus on their respective leads against their opponents rather than a direct comparison between Trump and Blackburn's performance.\n\nTo make a more informed prediction, a superforecaster would need to consider additional factors such as historical voting patterns in Tennessee, the specific issues driving voter sentiment, and any potential changes in voter behavior closer to the election date. However, based on the current polling data, both Trump and Blackburn appear to be in strong positions in their respective races.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Marsha Blackburn the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate race in Tennessee in 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nMarsha Blackburn won the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate in Tennessee on August 1, 2024, defeating her primary challenger Tres Wittum.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump likely to be the Republican nominee for president in the 2024 election?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nDonald Trump has already clinched the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential election. He surpassed the necessary 1,215-delegate threshold on March 12, 2024, and was officially nominated at the Republican National Convention on July 15, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant Democratic challengers to Marsha Blackburn in the 2024 Tennessee Senate race?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a significant Democratic challenger to Marsha Blackburn in the 2024 Tennessee Senate race. Gloria Johnson, a state representative and one of the \"Tennessee Three,\" has won the Democratic primary and will face off against Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn in the November general election. Despite the historical dominance of Republicans in Tennessee statewide elections, Johnson's candidacy and her national recognition could potentially mobilize Democratic enthusiasm.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump more popular among Tennessee voters than Marsha Blackburn?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether Donald Trump is more popular among Tennessee voters than Marsha Blackburn in absolute terms, as the polls measure different aspects and do not provide a direct comparison of their overall popularity.\n\n- The polls indicate that both Trump and Blackburn have significant support among Tennessee voters. Trump is leading in the presidential race with a substantial margin over his Democratic opponents.\n- Marsha Blackburn also has a strong lead in the U.S. Senate race against her Democratic challenger, Gloria Johnson.\n\nHowever, the sources do not provide a direct comparison of their popularity levels or a single metric that would allow us to determine which one is more popular overall.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout expected to be higher for the presidential race than for the senatorial race in Tennessee in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no direct information that compares the expected voter turnout for the presidential race versus the senatorial race in Tennessee for 2024. The sources discuss the historically low voter turnout in the August 2024 primaries, the number of candidates running, and the general voter turnout trends, but they do not provide specific expectations or comparisons for the upcoming presidential and senatorial races.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether voter turnout is expected to be higher for the presidential race than for the senatorial race in Tennessee in 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Tennessee voters likely to vote for Donald Trump but not for Marsha Blackburn, or vice versa?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that both Donald Trump and Marsha Blackburn have strong support in Tennessee, and their voter bases overlap significantly.\n\n- Trump has a significant lead in Tennessee, having won the state by 23 percentage points in 2020.\n- Marsha Blackburn, who is a strong ally of Trump, also has a wide lead in her Senate race and has been endorsed by Trump.\n\nGiven this information, it is unlikely that Tennessee voters would overwhelmingly support Trump but not Blackburn, or vice versa, as both candidates seem to draw support from a similar conservative base in the state.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, it is unlikely that Tennessee voters would vote for Donald Trump but not for Marsha Blackburn, or vice versa.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do current polls show Donald Trump leading his opponent by a larger margin than Marsha Blackburn is leading hers in Tennessee?\nANSWER: To determine if current polls show Donald Trump leading his opponent by a larger margin than Marsha Blackburn is leading hers in Tennessee, we need to compare the margins from the available polling data.\n\n### Donald Trump vs. Kamala Harris\n- In Georgia, according to a Rasmussen Reports poll, Trump is leading Harris by 5 points (51% to 46%).\n- In North Carolina and Georgia, based on CNN polls, Trump and Harris are nearly tied, with margins within the margin of error.\n\n### Marsha Blackburn\nThere is no information provided in the sources about the current polling margins for Marsha Blackburn's race in Tennessee. Therefore, we cannot compare the margins directly.\n\nGiven the lack of information on Marsha Blackburn's race, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant third-party or independent candidates in either the presidential or senatorial race in Tennessee?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several independent and third-party candidates participating in the presidential election in Tennessee, but their significance in terms of electoral viability is limited.\n\nFor the presidential election:\n- Multiple independent candidates are listed, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (who initially ran but later dropped out and endorsed Donald Trump), Jay Bowman, Claudia De La Cruz, Rachele Fruit, and others. However, none of these candidates are expected to have a significant impact on the outcome of the election in Tennessee, which is anticipated to be won by a wide margin by Donald Trump.\n\nFor the senatorial race:\n- There is no specific information provided in the sources about significant third-party or independent candidates in the senatorial race in Tennessee.\n\nGiven this information, while there are third-party and independent candidates, they do not appear to be significant contenders in the presidential election in Tennessee.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (for the senatorial race, as there is no provided information)\n**NO** (for the presidential election, in terms of significant impact)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have presidential candidates historically received more votes than senatorial candidates in Tennessee when both races occur simultaneously?\nANSWER: To determine if presidential candidates have historically received more votes than senatorial candidates in Tennessee when both races occur simultaneously, we need to compare the voter turnout and vote counts for these different types of elections.\n\n### Presidential Elections\nPresidential elections generally attract higher voter turnout compared to other types of elections. In Tennessee, as in many other states, presidential elections tend to have the highest voter participation. For example, in the 2020 presidential election, Donald Trump received over 1.9 million votes in Tennessee.\n\n### Senatorial Elections\nSenatorial elections, while important, typically do not draw the same level of voter participation as presidential elections. For instance, in the 2024 U.S. Senate election in Tennessee, the primary elections saw significantly lower voter turnout. Marsha Blackburn, the Republican nominee, received 367,799 votes in the primary, and Gloria Johnson, the Democratic nominee, received 143,962 votes in her primary.\n\n### Historical Context\nHistorically, this trend holds true. Presidential elections consistently have higher voter turnout and vote counts compared to senatorial elections. This is because presidential elections are often seen as more consequential and attract broader national and media attention.\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that presidential candidates have historically received more votes than senatorial candidates in Tennessee when both races occur simultaneously.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any factors, such as scandals or policy positions, that could affect the vote totals for Donald Trump or Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee?\nANSWER: Several factors could potentially influence the vote totals for Donald Trump and Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee, based on the provided sources:\n\n## Donald Trump\n- **Conviction and Legal Issues**: Trump's recent conviction on 34 felony counts could significantly impact his voter support. Many Tennessee lawmakers and Republican leaders have spoken out against the conviction, labeling it as a \"political attack\" and a \"witch hunt,\" which might solidify his base but could also alienate some voters who view the legal issues as serious.\n- **Perceptions of Justice System**: The widespread criticism from Tennessee Republicans that the justice system is politicized and that Trump's trial was unfair could sway voters who share these sentiments, potentially increasing his support among his loyal base but possibly deterring others who are concerned about the rule of law.\n- **Election Fraud Allegations**: Trump's repeated claims of election fraud, despite being debunked, have created a narrative that could influence voter perceptions. However, this has been consistently shown to be unfounded, and it may not sway voters who are skeptical of these claims.\n\n## Marsha Blackburn\n- **Support for Trump**: Blackburn's strong support for Trump and her vocal criticism of his conviction could influence her own voter base. Her alignment with Trump's narrative might strengthen her support among Trump loyalists but could also alienate voters who disagree with Trump's actions and the Republican Party's stance on his conviction.\n- **Policy Positions and Public Statements**: Blackburn's public statements and policy positions, particularly those that align with or diverge from the views of her constituents, can impact her vote totals. Her criticism of the justice system and her defense of Trump are likely to resonate with conservative voters but may be viewed negatively by others.\n\nIn summary, the factors that could affect vote totals include legal issues surrounding Trump, perceptions of the justice system, election fraud allegations, and the alignment of policy positions and public statements with voter sentiments.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately **5 days** left until the election results are known, as today is October 31, 2024, and Election Day is on November 5, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and Election Day, **Donald Trump would likely receive more votes in Tennessee than Marsha Blackburn**, resulting in the question resolving as **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith roughly **1.25 days** left until the election (a quarter of the remaining time), I would forecast a slightly higher probability that Trump will outperform Blackburn, due to the reduced likelihood of any significant event altering the current dynamics.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **20 days** remaining until the election (four times the current time left), I would forecast a marginally lower probability, as the extended time frame increases the chance of unforeseen events impacting voter sentiment.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Historical Voter Turnout:**\n   - Presidential elections typically attract higher voter turnout than senatorial races. Historical data indicates that more votes are cast for presidential candidates when both elections occur simultaneously.\n   - *Example:* In the 2016 presidential election, the total votes cast in Tennessee were higher than in the 2018 midterm senatorial election.\n\n2. **Past Election Data:**\n   - While there are exceptions (e.g., in 2012, Senator Bob Corker received slightly more votes than the presidential candidate Mitt Romney in Tennessee), these instances are rare and often influenced by unique circumstances.\n   - Generally, presidential candidates receive more votes due to the higher profile of the race and greater voter engagement.\n\n3. **Current Polling and Voter Sentiment:**\n   - Both Trump and Blackburn hold substantial leads over their Democratic opponents in Tennessee.\n   - Polls show Trump leading by a 21-point margin and Blackburn by a 23-point margin.\n   - Blackburn's approval rating is at 53%, her highest to date, but this does not necessarily translate to a higher vote count than Trump.\n\n4. **Voter Base Overlap:**\n   - Trump and Blackburn share a similar voter base in Tennessee, primarily composed of conservative and Republican voters.\n   - It's unlikely that a significant number of voters will choose one over the other, meaning their vote totals should correlate closely with overall voter turnout.\n\n5. **Impact of Third-Party Candidates:**\n   - There are no significant third-party or independent candidates in either race expected to draw substantial votes away from the main candidates.\n   - This reduces the likelihood that vote splitting will disproportionately affect one candidate over the other.\n\n6. **Potential Influencing Factors:**\n   - Legal issues surrounding Trump might affect his national popularity, but in Tennessee, his support remains robust.\n   - Blackburn's strong alignment with Trump could either bolster her support among his base or have minimal impact if voters are already inclined to vote for both.\n\n7. **Election Dynamics:**\n   - Presidential races receive more media coverage and public attention, often leading to higher engagement and turnout.\n   - Voters who participate in the presidential election are likely to vote down the ballot, including the senatorial race, but some voters may only vote for the presidential candidate.\n\n8. **Base Rates and Statistical Considerations:**\n   - Considering the historical trends and current data, the base rate probability of a presidential candidate receiving more votes than a senatorial candidate in Tennessee is high.\n   - Any events that could significantly alter voter behavior are unlikely to occur within the remaining time before the election.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the historical trends, current polling data, and the overlap in voter support for both candidates, it is highly probable that Donald Trump will receive more votes than Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee in the 2024 election.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
