    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Kamala Harris win New Mexico, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine in the 2024 election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kamala Harris wins the popular vote in New Mexico, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine, in the 2024 presidential election. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nOn journalist Mark Halperin's political discussion show [Two-Way on October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE-GYg9lD5Y), the panel mentioned that the biggest possible states for a Trump upset were New Mexico, New Hampshire, Maine, and Virginia.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Kamala Harris winning in New Mexico, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine in the 2024 presidential election, here are some key points and background information for each state:\n\n### New Mexico\n- New Mexico has historically leaned Democratic, with Democratic presidential candidates winning the state since 2008. The state's significant Latino population contributes to its Democratic lean.\n- Recent polls indicate that Kamala Harris is leading Donald Trump in New Mexico. For example, an Emerson College Polling survey from August 2024 showed Harris leading Trump by 10 points (52% to 42%).\n- The state's voting history and current polling data suggest that Harris is favored to win New Mexico.\n\n### New Hampshire\n- New Hampshire has traditionally been a competitive state but has trended Democratic in recent presidential elections. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden won the state by a 7.4-point margin.\n- While specific polling data for the 2024 election in New Hampshire is not provided in the sources, the state's recent voting patterns suggest it could remain Democratic.\n- However, without current polling data, it is less clear whether Harris will win New Hampshire compared to New Mexico.\n\n### Virginia\n- Virginia has also trended Democratic in recent years. In the 2020 election, Joe Biden won the state by a 10.1-point margin.\n- Virginia's demographic changes, particularly the growth of the Northern Virginia suburbs, have contributed to its shift towards the Democratic Party.\n- While there is no specific polling data provided for Virginia in the 2024 election, historical trends suggest that Harris might have an advantage.\n\n### Maine\n- Maine is another state that has leaned Democratic in recent presidential elections. In 2020, Joe Biden won the state by a 9.0-point margin.\n- Like New Hampshire and Virginia, Maine's voting history indicates a Democratic lean, but current polling data for the 2024 election is not available in the sources.\n- Historical trends suggest that Maine is likely to remain Democratic, but the absence of current polling data makes the outcome less certain.\n\n### General Observations\n- The Democratic Party has maintained a strong presence in these states in recent elections, which suggests a favorable environment for Kamala Harris.\n- Polling data, particularly for New Mexico, indicates a significant lead for Harris over Trump, which aligns with historical voting patterns in these states.\n- However, the absence of specific polling data for New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine in the 2024 election means that while historical trends are favorable, the outcome is not as clear as it is for New Mexico.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the available information:\n- **New Mexico**: Harris is likely to win, given historical trends and current polling data.\n- **New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine**: While historical trends suggest a Democratic lean, the lack of specific 2024 polling data makes it less clear whether Harris will win these states.\n\nTherefore, while Harris is favored in New Mexico, the outcome in New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine is less certain without current polling data.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Joe Biden win New Hampshire in the 2020 U.S. presidential election?\nANSWER: Yes, Joe Biden won New Hampshire in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThe U.S. presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. Today is October 29, 2024, so there are 7 days until Election Day. Election results are typically reported within a day or two, so the outcome will be known in approximately **8 to 9 days**.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current conditions remain the same:\n\n- **New Mexico:** Kamala Harris is likely to win, as polls from August 2024 show her leading by 10 points, and the state has a Democratic-leaning history.\n\n- **Virginia:** Harris is favored due to recent Democratic trends and demographic shifts benefiting Democrats, particularly in the Northern Virginia suburbs.\n\n- **New Hampshire:** Historically competitive but leans Democratic in recent elections. Without polling data indicating a significant shift, Harris has an edge.\n\n- **Maine:** Tends to vote Democratic statewide. While the 2nd Congressional District may favor Trump, the question concerns the statewide popular vote, which Harris is likely to win.\n\nTherefore, if nothing changes, Harris would likely win **all four states**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **2 days** left until the election, there would be minimal time for any significant changes. Voter opinions would be largely solidified, and early voting would be completed or nearly so. In this scenario, confidence in Harris winning all four states would be slightly **higher** due to reduced uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were about **28 days** until the election, there would be more opportunity for events that could influence voter sentiment, such as debates, major news stories, or campaign developments. This additional time increases the potential for unexpected shifts, so the probability of Harris winning all four states would be slightly **lower** due to increased uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **New Mexico:**\n  - **Polling Data:** An August 2024 Emerson College poll shows Harris leading by 10 points.\n  - **Historical Trends:** Consistently Democratic since 2008.\n  - **Demographics:** Significant Latino population favors Democrats.\n  - **Conclusion:** High likelihood of Harris winning.\n\n- **Virginia:**\n  - **Historical Trends:** Democratic in recent elections, with Biden winning by 10.1% in 2020.\n  - **Demographics:** Growth in Democratic-leaning suburbs.\n  - **Conclusion:** Harris is favored to win.\n\n- **New Hampshire:**\n  - **Historical Trends:** Competitive but leans Democratic; Biden won by 7.4% in 2020.\n  - **Polling Data:** Lack of recent polls adds uncertainty.\n  - **Conclusion:** Likely but less certain for Harris.\n\n- **Maine:**\n  - **Historical Trends:** Generally Democratic; Biden won statewide by 9% in 2020.\n  - **Electoral System:** Maine splits electoral votes, but the question focuses on the statewide popular vote.\n  - **Conclusion:** Harris is favored to win statewide.\n\n- **Overall Probability Assessment:**\n  - **Individual Probabilities:** Estimating Harris's chances as approximately:\n    - New Mexico: 95%\n    - Virginia: 90%\n    - New Hampshire: 75%\n    - Maine: 80%\n  - **Combined Probability:** Multiplying the individual probabilities (converted to decimals):\n    - 0.95 * 0.90 * 0.75 * 0.80 ≈ 0.513\n    - This results in a combined probability of approximately **51%**.\n  - **Adjusted Assessment:** Considering potential polling errors and the possibility of correlated outcomes, I will adjust the probability upward slightly due to the Democratic lean of these states.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**Probability: 70%**",
