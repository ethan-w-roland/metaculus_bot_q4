    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nOn December 31, 2024, will Cruise operate a rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the United States?\n\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-15\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve \"Yes\" if credible sources indicate that rider-only ride-hailing trips operated by Cruise are available to the general public anywhere in the United States on December 31, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- \"Rider-only\" means one in which the only humans in the car are passengers and no human operates the vehicle for the duration of the trip.\n- \"Available to the general public\" means that any member of the public is eligible to use the service without first joining a waitlist or having been granted use of the service as part of a limited testing or early access phase.\n- \"United States\" means the 50 states plus the District of Columbia.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThis question is part of the [Understanding AI Series with Timothy B Lee](https://www.metaculus.com/project/3055/) and was inspired by [this post](https://www.understandingai.org/p/the-coming-waymo-monopoly).\n\nCruise, the autonomous vehicle unit of General Motors, has faced significant setbacks in its efforts to deploy self-driving vehicles. In late October 2023, Cruise [suspended](https://apnews.com/article/cruise-robotaxi-suspends-operations-gm-73f27ef959afe1e201e61f0fd31802d5) all driverless operations nationwide after California regulators ordered the company to remove its driverless cars from state roads, citing safety concerns and accusing Cruise of misrepresenting the technology's capabilities.\n\nThe California Department of Motor Vehicles [stated](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/news-and-media/dmv-statement-on-cruise-llc-suspension/) that Cruise's driverless vehicles posed \"an unreasonable risk to public safety\" and that the company had provided misleading information about the safety of its self-driving system. This move by regulators came after a series of incidents involving Cruise vehicles, including crashes caused by the vehicles' abrupt braking.\n\nAdditionally, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) [is investigating](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/cruise-under-nhtsa-probe-into-autonomous-driving-pedestrian-injuries.html) multiple reports of Cruise self-driving cars engaging in inappropriately hard braking, resulting in collisions. The agency is seeking more information from Cruise regarding five new crash reports involving such incidents.\n\nCruise's suspension of driverless operations across the U.S. represents a major setback for the company and General Motors' ambitions in the autonomous vehicle space. The company has [stated](https://x.com/Cruise/status/1717707807460393022?s=20) that it would take time to examine its processes and rebuild public trust.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Cruise will operate a rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the United States by December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Status and Challenges\n- Cruise's license to operate driverless rides in California was suspended in October 2023 following a serious incident involving a pedestrian. This suspension has not been lifted as of the latest updates[2][3][4].\n- Despite the suspension in California, Cruise has been operating its vehicles in other cities such as Phoenix, Dallas, and Houston, but with human safety drivers present[1][2][3].\n\n## Plans and Partnerships\n- Cruise is targeting a return to fully autonomous rides later in 2024 and possibly charging fares by early 2025. However, this plan is contingent on resolving the current regulatory and safety issues[1].\n- Cruise has entered into a multiyear partnership with Uber to integrate its robotaxis into Uber's ride-hailing service, but this will not include California until the license suspension is resolved[2][4].\n\n## Regulatory and Safety Considerations\n- Cruise is still working to address regulatory concerns and safety issues. An investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) into potential flaws in Cruise vehicles remains pending as of May 2024[3].\n\nGiven these points, while Cruise is actively working towards resuming fully autonomous operations and has plans in place, it is uncertain whether they will achieve this goal by December 31, 2024, especially considering the ongoing regulatory and safety issues.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the available information, it is not clear whether Cruise will operate a rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the United States by December 31, 2024. The resolution of regulatory issues, particularly the reinstatement of their California license and the outcome of the NHTSA investigation, will be crucial in determining their ability to meet this timeline. Therefore, the answer to this question cannot be definitively stated as yes or no at this time.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Cruise operating any driverless ride-hailing services without a safety driver in any U.S. state as of today?\nANSWER: No, Cruise is not operating any driverless ride-hailing services without a safety driver in any U.S. state as of today. The sources indicate that Cruise's driverless vehicles were grounded following a safety incident and, although they are working towards relaunching their services, they are currently conducting manual and supervised autonomous testing with safety drivers involved[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Cruise involved in any new partnerships that could facilitate the deployment of rider-only services?\nANSWER: Yes, Cruise is involved in a new partnership that could facilitate the deployment of rider-only services. Cruise has announced a multiyear strategic partnership with Uber to bring Cruise autonomous vehicles to the Uber platform. As part of this partnership, when an Uber rider requests a qualifying ride on the Uber app, they may be presented with the option to have that trip fulfilled by a Cruise autonomous vehicle, which is essentially a rider-only service[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Cruise currently operating a rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the United States?\nANSWER: NO\n\nCruise is not currently operating a rider-only (driverless) ride-hailing service anywhere in the United States. The company has resumed testing operations in cities like Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix, but these operations include human safety drivers onboard to supervise and intervene if necessary[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Cruise announced plans to resume rider-only ride-hailing services before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Cruise has not announced specific plans to resume rider-only (driverless) ride-hailing services before December 31, 2024. While Cruise has resumed supervised autonomous driving in several cities and plans to launch a partnership with Uber to offer driverless rides next year, there is no clear indication that these services will be fully operational and open to the public before the end of 2024[1][2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded its investigation into Cruise's autonomous vehicles?\nANSWER: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has concluded one of its investigations into Cruise's autonomous vehicles, but not all of them.\n\n- One investigation regarding unexpected hard braking and immobilization of Cruise vehicles was closed after a software recall and updates that addressed the issue[3][4][5].\n\nHowever, NHTSA is still investigating other aspects, such as reports that Cruise's robotaxis may not have used proper caution around pedestrians in roadways, including crosswalks and sidewalks[3][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as it depends on which specific investigation is being referred to.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the California Department of Motor Vehicles reinstated Cruise's license to operate driverless rides as of today?\nANSWER: As of the current date (November 15, 2024), there is no indication that the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) has reinstated Cruise's license to operate driverless rides. The sources mention that the DMV suspended Cruise's deployment and driverless testing permits in October 2023 due to safety concerns and that Cruise must meet specific requirements to have its permits reinstated, but there is no mention of the permits being reinstated as of the latest updates[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any U.S. states where Cruise has regulatory approval to operate rider-only ride-hailing services?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a U.S. state where Cruise has had regulatory approval to operate rider-only ride-hailing services, although the current status is complicated due to recent suspensions.\n\nCruise received a permit from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in June 2022 to operate a commercial driverless ride-hailing service in San Francisco[1][2][5].\n\nHowever, in October 2023, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and the CPUC suspended Cruise's permits due to safety concerns and incidents, including a pedestrian collision[2][3][4].\n\nAs of May 2024, Cruise began returning its vehicles to public roads, but the regulatory approval status remains under review and subject to reinstatement conditions[2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of increased public trust in Cruise's autonomous vehicle technology since the suspension?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence of increased public trust in Cruise's autonomous vehicle technology since the suspension.\n\n- The sources highlight various challenges and incidents that have eroded public trust, such as the pedestrian incident in San Francisco, the revocation of Cruise's operating permit, and ongoing concerns about safety and transparency[2][3][4].\n- While Cruise has taken steps to rebuild trust, such as resuming manual driving to gather data, improving safety protocols, and engaging with communities, these efforts are described as ongoing and aimed at future trust-building rather than indicating current increased trust[1][3].\n- The study from Washington State University emphasizes that trust is critical for the acceptance of autonomous vehicles, but it does not indicate that trust in Cruise's technology has increased since the suspension[5].\n\nTherefore, the current evidence does not suggest an increase in public trust.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Cruise resolved the safety concerns that led to the suspension of its driverless operations?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that Cruise has taken several steps to address safety concerns, but it is not clear if all the specific concerns that led to the suspension of its driverless operations have been fully resolved.\n\n- Cruise has resumed supervised autonomous driving with safety drivers present, which is a critical validation phase before driverless deployment. This indicates they are working on validating their AV's performance against rigorous safety and AV performance requirements[3].\n- They have implemented various safety measures, including product safety, operational safety, and enterprise safety protocols[3][4].\n- However, there is an ongoing investigation by the NHTSA into whether Cruise is taking sufficient precautions to safeguard pedestrians, which suggests that some safety concerns may still be under review[5].\n\nGiven this information, the answer to whether Cruise has resolved all the safety concerns that led to the suspension of its driverless operations is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any new laws or regulations been enacted that would hinder Cruise from operating rider-only services?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that new laws or regulations have been enacted specifically to hinder Cruise from operating rider-only services. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Texas Regulations**: The proposed regulations in Texas aim to establish a system for notifying the Department of Motor Vehicles when human drivers are removed from vehicles, but these are still in the discussion phase and have not yet been enacted. They do not specifically target rider-only services[1].\n\n2. **Cruise Operations**: Cruise has been working to resume its operations, including manual and supervised driving, as part of its plan to return to driverless services. There is no mention of new laws or regulations that would prevent rider-only services[2][3].\n\n3. **NHTSA Consent Order**: The consent order with NHTSA addresses Cruise's failure to comply with crash reporting rules, but it does not impose new restrictions on operating rider-only services[4].\n\nTherefore, based on the current information, there are no new laws or regulations that have been enacted to hinder Cruise from operating rider-only services.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as there is no definitive evidence of new laws or regulations specifically targeting rider-only services)",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, there are approximately 14 months remaining until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed from the situation in October 2023, Cruise would not be operating a rider-only ride-hailing service anywhere in the United States by December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about 3.5 months left until December 31, 2024, I would assign a lower probability due to the limited time for Cruise to resolve regulatory and technical challenges.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately 56 months until December 31, 2024, I would assign a higher probability, as Cruise would have more time to address regulatory concerns, improve technology, and expand operations.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of October 2023, Cruise faced significant regulatory and operational setbacks that impeded its ability to operate rider-only (driverless) ride-hailing services:\n\n- **Regulatory Suspensions:** The California Department of Motor Vehicles suspended Cruise's driverless permits due to safety concerns, citing incidents where Cruise vehicles posed risks to public safety. This suspension halted their operations in one of their key markets.\n\n- **Safety Investigations:** The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) was investigating multiple incidents involving Cruise's autonomous vehicles, including collisions caused by abrupt braking and interactions with pedestrians. Such federal investigations can lead to prolonged scrutiny and additional regulatory hurdles.\n\n- **Operational Challenges:** Cruise halted all driverless operations nationwide to reassess safety protocols and rebuild public trust. Restarting operations would require not only resolving technical issues but also regaining approvals from state and federal agencies.\n\n- **Timeline Constraints:** Addressing these challenges typically requires extensive time. Regulatory approvals can take months or even years, especially when safety concerns are involved. Additionally, technological adjustments, testing, and validation are time-consuming processes.\n\n- **Market Dynamics:** Competition in the autonomous vehicle space is intense, with other companies also seeking regulatory approvals and market share. Cruise's setbacks may give competitors an advantage, potentially influencing regulatory bodies and public perception.\n\nGiven these factors, the likelihood that Cruise will overcome these significant obstacles and resume rider-only ride-hailing services by December 31, 2024, is low. While it's possible that Cruise could make substantial progress within 14 months, the scale of the regulatory and technical challenges suggests a cautious outlook.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
