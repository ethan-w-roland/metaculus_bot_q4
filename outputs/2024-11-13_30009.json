    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Nebraska have 1.5 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-13\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/nebraska) lists greater than or equal to 1.5 million Nebraska residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after December 31, 2024. If the number is below 1.5 million, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[No improvement for ongoing drought in Omaha](https://www.wowt.com/2024/10/24/no-improvement-ongoing-drought-omaha/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Nebraska having 1.5 million or more residents living in drought by December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Drought Conditions\nAs of October 29, 2024, severe drought covers over 75% of Nebraska, with almost 8% of the state in extreme drought. Only 4 counties in southwest Nebraska are completely free of drought[3].\n\n## Population Affected\nAccording to the U.S. Drought Monitor, as of the recent reports, approximately 1.8 million Nebraska residents are living in areas affected by drought[4].\n\n## Weather Outlook\nThere is a potential for significant precipitation in the coming weeks, particularly in eastern Nebraska. Forecast models suggest several rounds of precipitation starting from early November, which could improve soil moisture and alleviate some of the drought conditions[3].\n\n## Historical Context and Trends\nThe current drought is part of a larger trend of increasing drought intensity and frequency, partly attributed to human-caused climate change. However, the immediate forecast suggests a possible wet pattern that could mitigate the drought to some extent[1][3].\n\n## Base Rates and Time to Resolution\nGiven the rapid development of the current \"flash drought\" and the potential for beneficial rains in the near future, the situation is highly dynamic. The drought could either persist or improve significantly depending on the actual precipitation received over the next few weeks[1][3].\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is currently uncertain whether the drought conditions will persist or improve by December 31, 2024, several factors suggest that the situation could change:\n- The population already affected by drought is close to 1.8 million.\n- There is a forecast for significant precipitation that could reduce the number of residents living in drought areas.\n- However, the drought's rapid intensification and the unpredictability of weather patterns make it difficult to predict with certainty.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Nebraska will have 1.5 million or more residents living in drought by December 31, 2024, is not immediately clear and depends on the actual weather conditions and precipitation received in the coming weeks.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current soil moisture levels in Nebraska significantly below average?\nANSWER: Yes, the current soil moisture levels in Nebraska are significantly below average.\n\n- As of the latest reports, a vast majority of eastern Nebraska is below the 5th percentile for soil moisture climatology, indicating very low soil moisture levels[1][3].\n- The soil moisture at 0–100cm depth falls between the 5th to 10th percentile of historical measurements for this time of year, which is significantly below average[3].\n- The topsoil and subsoil moisture levels are reported as very short or short in a significant portion of the state, with only a small percentage classified as adequate or surplus[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is El Niño or La Niña expected to affect Nebraska's weather patterns in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, La Niña is expected to affect Nebraska's weather patterns in December 2024.\n\n- There is a 60% chance that a weak La Niña will develop in the autumn and persist through January-March 2025[2][4].\n- La Niña conditions typically influence winter weather, including areas such as Nebraska, with effects such as increased risk of drought in the western parts of the state and variable temperature and precipitation patterns[2][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the area of Nebraska under drought conditions decreased over the past month?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the area of Nebraska under drought conditions has not decreased over the past month; in fact, it has intensified or remained severe in many areas.\n\n- As of the end of October, severe drought covers over 75 percent of Nebraska, and almost 8 percent of the state is in extreme drought[2].\n- The drought conditions in Nebraska have worsened, with severe and extreme drought expanding over various parts of the state[3].\n\nTherefore, the area under drought conditions in Nebraska has not decreased but has either remained severe or worsened.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the historical average precipitation in Nebraska during December sufficient to alleviate severe drought conditions?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the historical average precipitation in Nebraska during December is relatively low.\n\n- From source [2], the average precipitation in December for Lincoln, Nebraska is 1.18 inches[2].\n- Source [4] shows a similar average for December, with a normal precipitation of 0.42 inches[4].\n\nGiven these values, the average precipitation in December is not substantial enough to significantly alleviate severe drought conditions, especially considering that droughts often require more sustained and higher levels of precipitation to be fully alleviated. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous autumn droughts in Nebraska typically persisted into January?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that drought conditions in Nebraska can persist through various seasons, including from autumn into the following year.\n\n- The sources indicate that drought conditions in Nebraska often continue through the winter months. For example, the U.S. Drought Monitor and other reports mention that droughts in the region, including Nebraska, tend to persist during the winter because soils are often frozen, limiting the ability to replenish soil moisture[3][4][5].\n- Specifically, the Seasonal Drought Outlook for the Missouri River Basin, which includes Nebraska, shows that drought is expected to persist across the region from December through March, which includes January[3].\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to conclude that previous autumn droughts in Nebraska have typically persisted into January.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are climate models predicting that drought conditions will persist in Nebraska through December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, climate models and drought outlooks are predicting that drought conditions will persist in Nebraska through December 2024.\n\n- The seasonal drought outlook for September 19–December 31, 2024, indicates that drought is likely to persist across portions of the Midwest, including Nebraska, through the end of the year[1].\n- Specific updates for Nebraska mention that the drought has been intensifying and is expected to continue, with no significant rain forecasted for the near future, which suggests persistent drought conditions[5].\n- The U.S. Drought Monitor and other reports also highlight the ongoing and worsening drought conditions in Nebraska, which are expected to continue into the fall and early winter[2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nebraska received above-average precipitation in the last two weeks?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Nebraska has experienced significant rainfall in the last two weeks, particularly in certain areas.\n\n- The recent rainfall events, especially those occurring around Halloween and early November, brought substantial rain to many parts of Nebraska. For example, the Omaha area received upwards of 2\" of rain, and some areas received between 1-2\" of rain from November 2 to November 5[1].\n- This rainfall has been described as \"beneficial\" and has led to improvements in drought conditions in many areas, although some parts of the state, such as the northeastern and northwestern regions, have not received as much rain[1][2].\n\nGiven this information, it can be concluded that many areas of Nebraska have received above-average precipitation in the last two weeks, especially when compared to the preceding dry period.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do meteorologists expect drought conditions in Nebraska to improve before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is some indication that meteorologists anticipate potential improvement in drought conditions in Nebraska, although it is not a certainty.\n\n- A report from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln mentions that after weeks of dry weather, the next seven days may be quite wet, especially in southeastern Nebraska, with several rounds of precipitation expected. This could put a significant dent in the drought, although it may not completely end it[4].\n- There is also mention of beneficial rains that have already fallen in some parts of the state, which have shown some modest improvements in soil moisture[4].\n\nWhile these indications suggest that there could be some improvement, they do not guarantee that the drought conditions will fully improve before December 31, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as the sources suggest potential improvement but do not provide a definitive prediction for complete improvement by the end of 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is significant precipitation forecasted for Nebraska during the remainder of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, here is the analysis:\n\n- For the immediate future, through the end of September and into early October, Nebraska is expected to remain dry with minimal rain chances. This is indicated by the forecast showing no rain chances through the end of September and minimal rain chances through the first week of October[1].\n\n- However, looking ahead to the later parts of the year, there are indications of potential precipitation. The National Weather Service forecast suggests that La Niña conditions, which are likely to develop, will impact the weather, leading to above-average precipitation in the eastern third of the country, including the Midwest, during the winter months[3].\n\n- The Farmers' Almanac also predicts a wet and cold winter for most locations, with above-normal precipitation expected over the eastern third of the country, including the Great Lakes and Midwest regions[2].\n\nGiven these forecasts, while the immediate future through early October is expected to be dry, significant precipitation is forecasted for Nebraska during the winter months of 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of November 13, 2024, are there 1.5 million or more Nebraska residents living in drought areas according to the Drought Monitor?\nANSWER: To determine if there are 1.5 million or more Nebraska residents living in drought areas as of November 13, 2024, we need to consider the following points:\n\n1. **Drought Extent**: The U.S. Drought Monitor indicates that a significant portion of Nebraska is under drought conditions. As of November 5, 2024, severe and extreme drought had expanded over various parts of the state, including western, southern, and eastern Nebraska[1][2][3].\n\n2. **Population**: Nebraska's total population is approximately 1.97 million people, according to recent estimates.\n\n3. **Affected Areas**: While the exact number of residents living in drought-affected areas is not provided in the sources, given that a large swath of the state is under drought conditions, it is reasonable to infer that a substantial portion of the population is affected.\n\nGiven that nearly half of the state or more is likely under some level of drought, and considering Nebraska's population, it is plausible that more than 1.5 million residents are living in drought areas. However, without precise demographic data on the affected regions, this is an educated inference rather than a definitive answer.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately **48 days** remaining until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current conditions persist, the outcome would be **Yes**, as approximately **1.8 million** Nebraska residents are currently living in areas affected by drought, which exceeds the threshold of 1.5 million residents.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only about **12 days** left, the probability that drought conditions would remain affecting 1.5 million or more residents would be **higher**, as significant changes in drought conditions are unlikely over such a short period.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **192 days** remaining, the probability would be **lower**, as there would be more time for potential changes in weather patterns, such as spring precipitation, which could alleviate drought conditions and reduce the number of residents living in drought areas below 1.5 million.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of **November 13, 2024**, severe drought covers over **75%** of Nebraska, with almost **8%** of the state in extreme drought. Approximately **1.8 million** Nebraska residents are currently living in areas affected by drought, exceeding the threshold specified in the question.\n\n**Weather Outlook:**\n\n- **Precipitation Forecast:** While there is potential for significant precipitation in the coming weeks, particularly in eastern Nebraska, December historically has low average precipitation not typically sufficient to alleviate severe drought conditions.\n  \n- **Climate Factors:** The expected **La Niña** conditions tend to influence Nebraska's weather patterns by bringing drier conditions, which may contribute to the persistence of drought.\n\n**Historical Context:**\n\n- **Persistence of Droughts:** Previous autumn droughts in Nebraska have typically persisted into January due to factors like frozen soils limiting moisture replenishment.\n  \n- **Soil Moisture Levels:** Current soil moisture levels are significantly below average, indicating that substantial precipitation would be required to alleviate drought conditions.\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n\n- **Rainfall Events:** Recent rainfall has provided some relief in certain areas; however, improvements have been modest, and many regions remain under severe drought.\n\n- **Meteorological Expectations:** Meteorologists suggest that while some improvement is possible, drought conditions are expected to persist through December 31, 2024.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the current severity of the drought, the large number of residents affected, historical trends of drought persistence, and climatic factors such as La Niña, it is **likely** that Nebraska will have **1.5 million or more residents living in drought** on December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
