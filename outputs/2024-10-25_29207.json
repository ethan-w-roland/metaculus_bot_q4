{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before November 1, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after September 30, 2024, and before November 1, 2024 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements[here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before November 1, 2024, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the Federal Reserve's [target funds rate history page](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the most recent rate cuts were on September 19, 2024, after a few years of relatively higher and rising interest rates. Previous cuts were on March 16, 2020, and March 3, 2020. Before then, there were three separate rate cuts in 2019.  \n\nThe September 2024 FOMC meeting is [scheduled](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/02/12/what-to-expect-from-the-feds-remaining-meetings-of-2024) for September 18th. \n\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information available, it is highly unlikely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates before November 1, 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet on November 6-7, 2024, and is expected to announce its interest rate decision on November 7.\n- There is no indication of an FOMC meeting or a planned rate cut before this scheduled meeting.\n- The last interest rate cut was announced on September 18, 2024, and the next decision is anticipated to be made during the November meeting.\n\nTherefore, based on the current information, the answer to whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates before November 1, 2024, is **no**.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the next scheduled Federal Open Market Committee meeting after November 1, 2024?\nANSWER: YES, the next scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting after November 1, 2024, is scheduled for November 6-7, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are financial markets currently expecting a rate cut before November 1, 2024?\nANSWER: NO,\n\nFinancial markets are not expecting a rate cut before November 1, 2024. The sources indicate that the next expected rate cut is scheduled for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in November, specifically on November 6-7. There are no indications of a rate cut before this date.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any scheduled announcements regarding interest rates by the Federal Reserve before November 1, 2024?\nANSWER: No, there are no scheduled announcements regarding interest rates by the Federal Reserve before November 1, 2024. The next Federal Reserve meeting and interest rate decision is scheduled for November 6-7, 2024, with the announcement to be made on November 7, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Open Market Committee scheduled any emergency meetings between October 25, 2024, and November 1, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any emergency meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) scheduled between October 25, 2024, and November 1, 2024. The sources discuss regular FOMC meetings and a recent rate cut in September, but they do not indicate any emergency meetings in the specified period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as there is no information provided to confirm or deny the scheduling of an emergency meeting during that time frame.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is it common for the Federal Reserve to change interest rates outside of scheduled Federal Open Market Committee meetings?\nANSWER: It is not common, but it is possible for the Federal Reserve to change interest rates outside of the scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. The FOMC typically meets eight times a year to set monetary policy, but they can also meet and adjust interest rates at other times if the economy is volatile or if there is an economic emergency.\n\nAs stated in the sources, \"The FOMC can also meet outside their regular eight-meeting schedule if the economy is volatile\". This indicates that while scheduled meetings are the norm, the Federal Reserve has the flexibility to make adjustments outside of these scheduled times if necessary.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Reserve announced any intentions or plans to cut interest rates before November 1, 2024?\nANSWER: YES, the Federal Reserve has announced intentions and plans to cut interest rates before November 1, 2024. On September 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve announced a 50-basis point cut in the federal funds rate, which was the first rate cut in four years.\n\nAdditionally, the Fed has signaled potential further cuts, as indicated by their 'dot plot' and market expectations. For example, the Fed has suggested the possibility of additional rate cuts by the end of the year, and markets expect another rate cut in November. However, the specific cut before November 1, 2024, that has already been implemented is the one announced on September 18.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any Federal Reserve officials indicated that an interest rate cut is likely before November 1, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Federal Reserve officials have indicated that an interest rate cut is likely before November 1, 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points in September 2024 and signaled potential further cuts. The 'dot plot' indicated an expectation of 50 additional basis points in reductions by the end of the year.\n- Chair Jerome Powell mentioned that officials are likely to reduce interest rates in the upcoming months as the labor market decelerates and inflation decreases. Specifically, he pointed to the possibility of two more normal-size rate cuts this year.\n- The next Federal Reserve meeting is scheduled for November 6-7, but market forecasts and Fed officials' comments suggest that there is a likelihood of another rate cut before the end of the year, which includes the period before November 1.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Reserve historically made unscheduled rate cuts between scheduled meetings?\nANSWER: Yes, the Federal Reserve has historically made unscheduled rate cuts between its scheduled meetings, particularly in response to significant economic or financial crises.\n\n- In October 1987, following the Black Monday stock market crash, the Fed made an emergency rate cut.\n- During the Russian financial crisis, Asian economic crisis, and the collapse of the hedge fund LTCM in 1998, the Fed implemented surprise interest rate cuts.\n- In 2001, after the tech bubble burst and the 9/11 attacks, the Fed made several emergency rate cuts.\n- In 2007-2008, during the financial crisis, the Fed made multiple unscheduled rate cuts.\n- In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed made emergency rate cuts outside of its scheduled meetings.\n\nThese instances demonstrate that the Federal Reserve does indeed make unscheduled rate cuts when faced with extraordinary economic conditions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant economic downturn or financial crisis in October 2024 that would prompt the Federal Reserve to cut rates?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication of a significant economic downturn or financial crisis in October 2024 that would necessarily prompt the Federal Reserve to cut rates at this specific time.\n\n- The U.S. Economic Outlook from Comerica Bank mentions a rate-reduction cycle that started in September, but it does not indicate a new or sudden crisis in October.\n- The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) shows a decline, which signals uncertainty and potential for moderate growth issues, but it does not confirm an imminent financial crisis in October 2024.\n- The IMF's European Economic Outlook discusses ongoing economic challenges, particularly due to the war in Ukraine, but this is not specific to the U.S. or October 2024.\n\nTherefore, the information available does not confirm a significant economic downturn or financial crisis in October 2024 that would prompt the Federal Reserve to cut rates at this time.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent economic indicators shown a sharp decline that would necessitate an immediate rate cut?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the indication is that while there are signs of economic slowdown and challenges, the necessity for an immediate rate cut is not universally clear.\n\n- The Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) has been declining, signaling headwinds to economic growth, but it does not necessarily call for an immediate rate cut. Instead, it suggests that the economy is expected to lose momentum in the second half of 2024, with potential interest rate cuts by the end of the year to support stronger economic activity in 2025.\n\n- The job market data shows some resilience, with the unemployment rate declining and strong job growth, which has reduced the likelihood of a significant interest rate cut in the near term. Investors now expect the Fed to act more cautiously, with a higher probability of a 25-basis-point cut rather than a 50-basis-point cut.\n\n- Global economic indicators, such as the manufacturing PMI, show declines in activity, particularly in the US, eurozone, Japan, and China. However, these declines do not necessarily translate to an immediate need for a rate cut but rather suggest ongoing economic challenges.\n\nGiven this information, while there are economic challenges and some indicators of slowdown, the sources do not strongly advocate for an immediate rate cut.\n\n**UNCLEAR**", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nThere are 7 days left until November 1, 2024. The period in question is from October 25, 2024, to October 31, 2024, inclusive.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, the outcome would be **No**. There are no scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings or planned rate announcements before November 1, 2024. Financial markets and Federal Reserve communications do not indicate any expectations of a rate cut within this timeframe.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only approximately 1.75 days left (a quarter of 7 days), the probability of the Federal Reserve announcing a rate cut would be even lower. I would forecast a probability of around **0.5%**, accounting for extremely rare, unforeseen emergencies that could prompt immediate action.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were 28 days left until November 1, 2024 (i.e., if today were October 3, 2024), there would be more time for unexpected events to occur. However, given the absence of scheduled meetings and lacking indications of economic distress, I would forecast a slightly higher probability of around **3%**, to account for the increased time frame in which an emergency could arise.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe probability of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates before November 1, 2024, is very low based on the following considerations:\n\n1. **Scheduled Meetings:**\n\n   - The next scheduled FOMC meeting is on **November 6-7, 2024**, with the interest rate decision announcement expected on November 7.\n   - There are **no scheduled FOMC meetings or rate announcements** before November 1, 2024.\n\n2. **Market Expectations:**\n\n   - Financial markets are **not expecting a rate cut** before November 1, 2024.\n   - Market forecasts and the Federal Reserve's communications suggest that any potential rate adjustments are anticipated during or after the November meeting.\n\n3. **Federal Reserve Communications:**\n\n   - Federal Reserve officials have **not indicated** any plans or intentions to cut rates before November 1, 2024.\n   - While there are mentions of potential rate cuts by the end of the year, these are expected to occur during scheduled meetings.\n\n4. **Historical Precedent for Unscheduled Cuts:**\n\n   - The Federal Reserve **can** make unscheduled rate cuts, but these are **rare** and typically in response to significant economic crises (e.g., 2008 financial crisis, 2020 COVID-19 pandemic).\n   - Historical frequency of unscheduled rate cuts is very low.\n\n5. **Current Economic Indicators:**\n\n   - There is **no evidence of a significant economic downturn or financial crisis** in October 2024 that would prompt an emergency rate cut.\n   - Recent economic data shows some challenges but does not indicate an immediate need for Federal Reserve intervention.\n   - The labor market remains relatively stable, and while certain indicators suggest economic slowdown, they do not necessitate urgent action.\n\n6. **Time Frame Constraints:**\n\n   - With only **7 days** remaining until November 1, the window for an unscheduled rate cut is very narrow.\n   - The absence of any scheduled events or hints from the Federal Reserve reduces the likelihood further.\n\n7. **Likelihood of Emergency Actions:**\n\n   - For an emergency rate cut to occur, there would likely need to be a significant and sudden economic event.\n   - There are **no current signs** of such an event unfolding within the next week.\n\nConsidering these factors, while it is **possible** for an unscheduled rate cut to occur, the probability is extremely low. The lack of scheduled meetings, absence of market expectations, and stable economic indicators all point toward a **No** resolution to the question.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 1%**", "probability": 1}
