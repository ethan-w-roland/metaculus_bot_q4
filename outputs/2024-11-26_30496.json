    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the temperature in Jacksonville, FL ever exceed 80 degrees F in the entire month of December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-26\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the high temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is ever above 80 degrees F for the Jacksonville Naval Air Station weather station, as reported [here](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/hist.phtml?station=NIP&network=FL_ASOS&year=2024&month=12). If this does not occur, then this question resolves as **No**. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nMissing data for any of the observed values (coded by the NWS as \"MM\") will not be considered.  No other resolution source other than the Data Calendar posted at Iowa State University will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [Iowa State University](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/), \"The Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM) collects environmental data from cooperating members with observing networks. The data are stored and made available on this website.\" \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the available weather forecasts and historical data for Jacksonville, FL in December, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Temperature Forecasts\n- The forecasts indicate that daytime temperatures in December 2024 are expected to be around 20°C (68°F) to 22°C (72°F)[2][5].\n- The highest daytime temperatures forecasted for December do not exceed 79°F (26°C), with most days ranging between 64°F (18°C) and 73°F (23°C)[4][5].\n\n## Historical Averages\n- December is generally a cooler month in Jacksonville, and historical averages do not typically show temperatures exceeding 80°F (27°C) during this time[2][3].\n\n## Specific Forecasts\n- None of the provided forecasts suggest any day in December 2024 will reach or exceed 80°F (27°C)[4][5].\n\nGiven this information, it is highly unlikely that the temperature in Jacksonville, FL will exceed 80 degrees F in the entire month of December 2024. However, weather forecasts are subject to some degree of uncertainty, but based on the current data, the answer leans strongly towards \"no.\"\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Jacksonville, FL experienced any December temperature anomalies exceeding 80°F in the past five years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the relevant information:\n\n- From the data on recent December temperatures in Jacksonville, FL, there is no record of temperatures exceeding 80°F in the past five years (2018-2023)[2].\n- The highest temperature recorded in December for the years 2018 to 2023 did not exceed 80°F. For example, in 2021, the highest temperature was 75°F, and in other years, the highs were similarly below 80°F[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any scheduled weather systems in December 2024 that could cause temperatures to exceed 80°F in Jacksonville, FL?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of any scheduled weather systems in December 2024 that would cause temperatures to exceed 80°F (27°C) in Jacksonville, FL.\n\n- The forecasts from Meteoprog, Weather2Travel, and World-Weather.info all indicate daytime temperatures in the range of around 64°F to 73°F (18°C to 23°C) for December, which is well below 80°F[1][2][4].\n- The Almanac's long-range forecast also does not suggest temperatures exceeding 80°F during December[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have climate change projections indicated a rise in December temperatures for Jacksonville, FL?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the climate change projections and winter outlooks do not specifically indicate a rise in December temperatures for Jacksonville, FL, due to climate change alone. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- NOAA's winter outlook for 2024-2025 predicts warmer-than-average temperatures for the southern tier of the U.S., including Florida, but this is attributed to the current weather patterns and La Niña conditions rather than long-term climate change trends[2][4].\n- There is no specific mention in the sources of long-term climate change projections causing a rise in December temperatures for Jacksonville.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Jacksonville Naval Air Station weather station expected to reliably report temperatures above 80°F in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the climate and average weather patterns at Jacksonville, Naval Air Station, it is highly unlikely for the temperatures to be above 80°F in December. Here are the key points:\n\n- The average temperature variations at Jacksonville, Naval Air Station show that the temperatures are generally cooler in December, with average highs typically below 70°F[1].\n- There is no indication in the provided sources that December would see temperatures consistently above 80°F.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the weather station at Jacksonville Naval Air Station would not reliably report temperatures above 80°F in December 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Jacksonville, FL contain microclimates that could reach above 80°F in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of microclimates in Jacksonville, FL that could reach above 80°F in December 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The average high temperatures for December in Jacksonville are typically around 65-70°F, with rare instances above 79°F[3][5].\n- There is no detailed information about microclimates that could significantly deviate from these average temperatures.\n\nGiven this, the answer to whether Jacksonville contains microclimates that could reach above 80°F in December 2024 is unclear based on the provided sources.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Jacksonville, FL historically recorded temperatures above 80°F in December?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data indicating that Jacksonville, FL has historically recorded temperatures above 80°F in December.\n\n- The climate data provided in the sources [1], [2], and [3] discuss average temperatures and extreme weather events, but they do not specify temperatures above 80°F for December.\n- Source [3] lists significant cold events and snow occurrences, which suggests that December is typically a cooler month.\n- Source [1] provides average temperature ranges for December, with a maximum average temperature of around 68°F (20°C), which is below 80°F.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent years shown an increasing trend in December temperatures in Jacksonville, FL?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no clear evidence of an increasing trend in December temperatures in Jacksonville, FL, over recent years.\n\n- The historical weather data from 1991-2020 shows average temperatures for December, but it does not indicate a specific trend of increasing temperatures in recent years[1].\n- The forecast for December 2024 is based on long-term prognosis and previous years' statistical data, but it does not provide a trend analysis for recent years[2].\n- The climate averages and historical data provided do not specify a recent increasing trend in December temperatures[4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is urban development in Jacksonville, FL contributing to higher December temperatures?\nANSWER: Yes, urban development in Jacksonville, FL is contributing to higher temperatures, including during all periods of the year, due to the urban heat island effect.\n\nThe urban heat island effect, as described in the sources, is caused by the built environment absorbing and retaining more heat than natural landscapes. This effect is not limited to any specific month but is a continuous phenomenon that amplifies temperatures in urban areas compared to surrounding areas.\n\n- The study by Climate Central indicates that densely populated urban areas like Jacksonville experience higher temperatures due to the concentration of buildings, pavement, and population density, which generate and retain heat[1][2][3].\n- This effect is not seasonal and contributes to higher temperatures throughout the year, including in December.\n\nTherefore, urban development in Jacksonville is indeed contributing to higher temperatures, including in December.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an upcoming El Niño or La Niña event expected to influence December 2024 temperatures in Jacksonville, FL?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is a expectation of a La Niña event rather than an El Niño event influencing the temperatures in the upcoming months, including December 2024.\n\n- The Climate Prediction Center (CPC) forecasts indicate that La Niña is favored to emerge in September-November 2024 with a 71% chance and is expected to persist through January-March 2025[2][3][4].\n- There is no indication of an upcoming El Niño event in the provided sources.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that a La Niña event is expected to influence December 2024 temperatures.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the December 2024 weather forecasts for Jacksonville, FL predicting any day with temperatures above 80°F?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication that the December 2024 weather forecasts for Jacksonville, FL are predicting any day with temperatures above 80°F.\n\n- The source from EasyWeather indicates maximum temperatures around 21°C (69.8°F) to 22°C (71.6°F)[1].\n- The Meteoprog source shows maximum temperatures ranging from 18°C (64.4°F) to 22°C (71.6°F)[2].\n- The Weather2Travel source mentions daytime maximum temperatures of 20°C (68°F)[3].\n- The World-Weather.info source lists temperatures in Fahrenheit, with the highest being around 70°F to 77°F[5].\n\nNone of these sources suggest temperatures exceeding 80°F (26.7°C) for any day in December 2024.\n\n**NO**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 35 days (from November 26, 2024, to December 31, 2024), with a final resolution by January 7, 2025, if necessary.\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changes:** If current weather patterns, forecasts, and historical trends persist without significant deviations, the temperature in Jacksonville, FL, is unlikely to exceed 80°F in December 2024. The outcome would be **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast with only a quarter of the time left:** With about 9 days remaining in December, ongoing weather patterns and forecasts continue to indicate temperatures well below 80°F. The forecast remains **No**.\n\n(d) **Forecast with 4x the time left:** Extending the timeframe beyond December doesn't apply in this context, as the question is specific to December 2024. However, if considering a hypothetical scenario with more time to gather data and observe trends within December, the likelihood of exceeding 80°F remains minimal. The forecast would still be **No**.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis of current weather forecasts, historical temperature data, and climate projections for Jacksonville, FL, several key points support a low probability of exceeding 80°F in December 2024:\n\n1. **Historical Trends:** Over the past five years, there have been no instances of December temperatures in Jacksonville surpassing 80°F. Historical averages consistently show highs well below this threshold.\n\n2. **Current Forecasts:** Multiple reliable sources predict daytime temperatures ranging from 64°F to 77°F for December 2024, with no indications of heatwaves or anomalous warming events that could push temperatures above 80°F.\n\n3. **Climate Factors:** While urban development contributes to the urban heat island effect, the magnitude is insufficient to elevate December temperatures to exceed 80°F. Additionally, the prevailing La Niña conditions are generally associated with cooler temperatures in certain regions, further reducing the likelihood of extreme heat events in December.\n\n4. **Resolution Criteria:** The structured resolution process relies on accurate and accessible data, which currently shows no trends or forecasts supporting temperatures above 80°F.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of Jacksonville, FL, experiencing temperatures above 80°F in December 2024 remains extremely low.\n\n**Probability: 2%**",
