    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of active US oil drilling rigs be greater than or equal to 585 and less than or equal to 590 on December 27, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of active oil drilling rigs is greater than or equal to 585 and less than or equal to 590 on December 27, 2024, according to the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count, which can be accessed at [this](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_rotary_rigs) Ycharts link. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe link will be accessed by Metaculus Admins on or around December 28, 2024. In case of its inaccessibility, the secondary resolution source will be from Baker Hughes itself at [this link](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count). If both resolution links remain inaccessible by the end of the tournament, the question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBaker Hughes [issues](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/) US oil rig counts every Friday, and issued oil rig counts to the petroleum industry since 1944. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the number of active US oil drilling rigs being within the range of 585 to 590 on December 27, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends\n- As of the latest data, the total US rig count is 584, with 478 of these being oil rigs[3][5].\n- The rig count has been relatively stable but slightly declining over recent weeks. For example, the US cut one rig in the week ending November 15, and the oil-focused rigs decreased by one to 478[3].\n\n## Historical Context\n- The US oil rig count has shown significant volatility in the past, particularly in response to changes in oil prices and drilling technology. However, recent trends indicate a more stable but slightly decreasing rig count[1][2].\n\n## Analyst Insights\n- J.P. Morgan analysts have noted that since July, the rig count has been relatively stagnant, suggesting that the year-end total may fall slightly short of their initial expectations. They remain confident that the current drilling activity will support their December exit target for oil production, but this does not necessarily imply an increase in rig counts[3].\n\n## Base Rates and Recent Changes\n- The average growth rate of the US Oil Rig Count has been around 2.22%, but recent weekly changes have been minimal or negative[1].\n- The total US rig count and specifically the oil rig count have been trending downward over the past year, with a -3.43% change in oil rigs from one year ago[1].\n\nGiven these points, it is uncertain whether the number of active US oil drilling rigs will be within the specified range of 585 to 590 by December 27, 2024. Here are some factors to consider for forecasting:\n\n- **Stability and Decline**: The recent stability and slight decline in rig counts suggest that a significant increase to reach or exceed 585 oil rigs might be unlikely.\n- **Analyst Expectations**: Analysts expect the rig count to remain relatively stable or slightly decrease, which aligns with current trends.\n- **Historical Volatility**: While historical data shows significant volatility, recent trends do not indicate a sharp increase in the near future.\n\nWithout more specific data or forecasts beyond the current trends, it is challenging to definitively predict whether the number will fall within the specified range. Therefore, the answer cannot be clearly determined as yes or no based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current number of active US oil drilling rigs greater than or equal to 585?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe current number of active US oil drilling rigs is 478, which is less than 585. This is confirmed by multiple sources, including Baker Hughesâ€™ latest rotary rig count released on November 15[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major oil companies planning to add rigs to their US drilling operations before the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication that major oil companies are specifically planning to add rigs to their US drilling operations before the end of 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss current and recent trends in drilling rig counts, such as the slight increases and decreases in various regions, but they do not provide explicit plans for adding rigs in the remainder of 2024[2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US oil rig count increased in each of the last four weeks?\nANSWER: No, the US oil rig count has not increased in each of the last four weeks. Here are the details:\n\n- In the week ended November 15, the oil rig count fell by one to 478[2][3][4].\n- In the week prior to that, the oil rig count remained flat at 479[4][5].\n- The weeks before that also saw either no change or a decline in the oil rig count[3][5].\n\nTherefore, there has not been a consistent increase in the US oil rig count over the last four weeks.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent policy changes that encourage the expansion of oil drilling in the US?\nANSWER: No, there have not been recent policy changes that encourage the expansion of oil drilling in the US. Instead, the Biden administration has implemented several policies that aim to limit or regulate oil drilling on public lands.\n\n- The administration has increased the minimum bond for oil and gas leases from $10,000 to $150,000 and raised the statewide bond minimum to $500,000, which is expected to make drilling more expensive and hold companies more accountable for cleanup costs[1][3][5].\n- There has been a significant reduction in lease sales on federal lands, with leasing reduced by as much as 95 percent, which is expected to shrink future oil and gas development[3][5].\n- New regulations have been put in place to limit practices such as speculative leasing and to increase royalties on federal leases. Additionally, there are new rules to limit venting and flaring of federal wells and to require supplemental cleanup insurance from offshore drillers[3][5].\n\nThese changes indicate a shift towards more stringent regulations and a reduction in the expansion of oil drilling activities.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a seasonal increase in US oil rig activity typically observed in December?\nANSWER: No, there is not typically a seasonal increase in US oil rig activity observed in December. Here are the key points:\n\n- Seasonal increases in oil rig activity are more commonly associated with the spring and early summer months when weather conditions improve, making it easier to access drilling sites. This is evident from the discussion on the impact of winter weather and the subsequent increase in activity with the arrival of spring[5].\n- The rig count tends to be influenced more by factors such as oil and gas prices, rather than a seasonal increase in December. For example, rig counts have historically followed changes in oil prices, and other factors like weather disruptions and gas prices also play significant roles[1][2][4].\n- There is no indication in the provided sources that December is a month when oil rig activity typically increases due to seasonal factors. Instead, the sources suggest that activity levels are more stable or even decline during certain periods, such as during the winter months[1][2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is \"NO\".\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are oil prices expected to rise significantly between November 19, 2024, and December 27, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no strong indication that oil prices are expected to rise significantly between November 19, 2024, and December 27, 2024.\n\n- The EIA forecast suggests that Brent crude oil prices are expected to average $82 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2024, but this does not indicate a significant rise from the current levels around $71-72 per barrel[1][4].\n- The current trends and forecasts indicate weak global demand, particularly from China, and ongoing geopolitical and economic factors that are likely to keep oil prices relatively stable or even lower than previous expectations[2][3].\n- There is no mention of a significant price increase in the short term; instead, the focus is on the overall weakness in oil demand and the potential for prices to remain around current levels or slightly above[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any supply chain disruptions that could prevent the deployment of additional rigs in the US?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several factors that could potentially disrupt the deployment of additional rigs in the US, although they may not be directly targeted at rig deployment:\n\n1. **Port Strike**: The strike by dockworkers along the East and Gulf coasts, which began on October 1, 2024, has halted operations at 14 major ports. This strike could delay the delivery of essential components and materials needed for rig deployment, as it affects the flow of goods including equipment and parts[1][5].\n\n2. **Transportation and Logistics Issues**: Ongoing challenges in transportation, such as delays and cost increases due to geopolitical tensions, extreme weather events, and constricted shipping routes (e.g., through the Red Sea and Suez Canals), could impact the timely delivery of necessary equipment and materials for rig deployment[2][3][4].\n\n3. **Material Availability and Price Volatility**: The ongoing material availability issues, particularly for core commodities like steel and aluminum, and the price volatility driven by economic inflation and geopolitical tensions, could affect the availability and cost of materials needed for rig construction and deployment[3][4].\n\nThese factors collectively suggest that there are indeed supply chain disruptions that could prevent or delay the deployment of additional rigs in the US.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent surge in investments in the US oil sector?\nANSWER: Yes, there has been a recent surge in investments in the US oil sector. Here are the key points that support this:\n\n- The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has forecast a significant increase in US crude oil production for 2024, driven by increased investment in oil extraction technologies and the discovery of new oil reserves[2].\n- Global upstream oil and gas capital expenditures, which include significant investments in the US, are expected to rise by $24 billion in 2024, surpassing $600 billion for the first time in a decade. This indicates a substantial increase in investment[1][4].\n- The US is expected to be one of the largest drivers of capital expenditure (capex) growth in the oil sector up to 2030, with technological innovations such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling contributing to higher production rates[1][4].\n\nThese factors collectively indicate a recent surge in investments in the US oil sector.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current economic outlook favorable for sustained or increased oil drilling activities in the US?\nANSWER: The current economic outlook appears to be generally favorable for sustained or increased oil drilling activities in the US, although there are some nuances and uncertainties to consider.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n1. **Increased Investment and Production**: The EIA forecasts an increase in US crude oil production, driven by technological advancements, favorable market dynamics, and supportive economic conditions. The US is expected to produce an average of 13.25 million barrels per day in 2024, up from previous estimates[1][2][3].\n\n2. **Economic Conditions**: The economic environment, both domestically and internationally, is supportive of investment in oil exploration and production. Stable economic conditions, favorable fiscal and monetary policies, and initiatives to promote energy independence are boosting confidence in the oil sector[2].\n\n3. **Global Demand and Prices**: Despite some short-term uncertainties, such as slowing economic activity and reduced fuel demand in China, the overall global oil demand is expected to rise. This demand growth, coupled with supply disruptions and OPEC+ production cuts, is expected to keep oil prices relatively high, which incentivizes producers to increase production[1][3].\n\n4. **Upstream Investment**: Global upstream oil and gas investment is expected to rise significantly, with North America being a major driver of this growth. This increased investment is crucial for maintaining and increasing production levels[4].\n\nHowever, there are also some uncertainties and potential challenges, such as geopolitical events, regulatory changes, and environmental concerns, which could impact the sustainability of this growth[1][2][4].\n\nIn summary, the current economic outlook is generally favorable for sustained or increased oil drilling activities in the US, but it is not without its uncertainties.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any technological advancements anticipated to make drilling more profitable in the US by December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several technological advancements anticipated to make drilling more profitable by December 2024. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n## Automated Drilling Systems\nAutomated drilling systems, which use robotics and AI, are expected to enhance the precision and speed of drilling operations, reduce human error, and boost overall operational accuracy. These systems can consistently perform at optimal levels, regardless of external conditions, leading to faster completion times and reduced downtime[1][3].\n\n## Advanced Drilling Fluids and Equipment\nInnovations such as advanced drilling fluids, low-emission engines, and biodegradable lubricants are aimed at reducing costs and environmental impact. These technologies extend equipment life and reduce the environmental footprint of drilling operations[1][3].\n\n## Remote Monitoring and Real-Time Data Analysis\nThe integration of remote operation technologies and real-time data analysis allows for immediate decision-making, enhances safety, and optimizes operations. This capability is particularly useful in difficult terrains or remote locations[1][3].\n\n## Efficient Drill Bit Design and Drill String Modeling\nAdvancements in drill bit design, such as novel solid lubricants and improved PDC bit performance, are expected to reduce torque and improve the rate of penetration (ROP). Additionally, advanced modeling techniques for drill strings and wellbore contacts are being developed to eliminate drilling dysfunctions and optimize complex downhole mechanics[5].\n\n## Sustainability Initiatives and Cost Reduction Strategies\nManufacturers and service providers are focusing on sustainability initiatives, such as low-carbon technology and efficient supply chain management, to reduce costs and ensure continuous drilling operations without unnecessary downtime[1][3].\n\nThese technological advancements are aimed at making drilling operations more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable, which should contribute to increased profitability in the drilling industry by December 2024.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n\nThere are **38 days** left until December 27, 2024.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n\nIf nothing changes, the number of active US oil drilling rigs would remain at **584**, which is **below** the lower bound of the specified range (585-590). Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n\nWith only **10 days** remaining (a quarter of the 38-day period), the forecast would likely remain **unchanged or slightly declining**, given the current trends of stability and minor reductions in rig counts. The probability of reaching **585 or more rigs** would remain low.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n\nWith **152 days** remaining (4 times the original period), there would be more opportunity for variables to influence the rig count significantly. Factors such as policy changes, market dynamics, and technological advancements could have a more pronounced effect. However, given the current declining trend and recent policy constraints, a substantial increase to reach **585 or more rigs** within this extended timeframe would still be **unlikely**, though slightly more probable than in the shorter timeframe.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 19, 2024, the current number of active US oil drilling rigs stands at **584**, with recent data indicating a **stable or slightly declining** trend. Several factors influence the likelihood of the rig count reaching between **585 and 590** by December 27, 2024:\n\n1. **Current Trends:** The rig count has been relatively stable but has seen slight declines in recent weeks. Analysts suggest that without significant changes, the trend is expected to continue downward or remain flat.\n\n2. **Policy Environment:** The Biden administration has implemented policies that make drilling more expensive and have reduced lease sales on federal lands by up to **95%**. These regulatory changes are designed to limit the expansion of oil drilling activities, thereby exerting downward pressure on rig counts.\n\n3. **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Recent port strikes and transportation challenges could delay the deployment of additional rigs, further inhibiting any potential increase in rig counts.\n\n4. **Investment Surge vs. Policy Constraints:** While there has been a surge in investments within the US oil sector, the policy constraints and recent declines in rig counts may offset the impact of increased capital. Additionally, technological advancements aimed at making drilling more profitable may not translate into immediate increases in rig counts within the short 38-day period.\n\n5. **External Factors:** Oil prices are not expected to rise significantly in the short term, reducing the economic incentive to deploy additional rigs swiftly.\n\n6. **Time Frame Consideration:** Given the relatively short time left (38 days), there is limited opportunity for the factors that could potentially increase rig counts to take effect meaningfully.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the probability that the number of active US oil drilling rigs will be between **585 and 590** by December 27, 2024, remains **low**.\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
