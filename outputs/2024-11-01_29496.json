    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the USDA-posted recall of Perdue Foods LLC's Frozen, Ready-To-Eat Chicken Breast Nugget and Tender Products  be closed before November 16, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of Purdue Foods's  frozen, ready-to-eat chicken breast nugget and tender items is changed from Active to Closed when [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/perdue-foods-llc-recalls-frozen-ready-eat-chicken-breast-nugget-and-tender-products) is accessed by Metaculus after November 15, 2024.  If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to NBC News on [August 17, 2024](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/perdue-recalls-frozen-ready-eat-chicken-nuggets-tenders-possible-metal-rcna167004), \"'FSIS is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers,' the agency said. 'Consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.' Perdue Foods LLC said in a news release that 'a foreign material was identified in a limited number of consumer packages.' FSIS said metal was found in the products and was discovered after consumer complaints about metal wire embedded in the food. 'We determined the material to be a very thin strand of metal wire that was inadvertently introduced into the manufacturing process,' said Jeff Shaw, Perdue’s senior vice president of food safety and quality. 'Out of an abundance of caution, we decided to voluntarily recall all of these packages of products.' There have been no confirmed reports of illness or injury, FSIS and Perdue said.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the USDA-posted recall of Perdue Foods LLC's Frozen, Ready-To-Eat Chicken Breast Nugget and Tender Products will be closed before November 16, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Recall Announcement and Timeline\n- The recall was announced on August 16, 2024, by Perdue Foods LLC in conjunction with the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).\n\n## Recall Process\n- The recall involves approximately 167,171 pounds of frozen chicken products, and it was initiated after consumer complaints about metal wire embedded in the products.\n- The FSIS conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that the recalling firm notifies their customers and ensures the recalled products are removed from the market.\n\n## Current Status\n- As of the announcement, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or injuries due to the consumption of these products.\n- Consumers are advised not to consume the products and to either discard them or return them to the place of purchase.\n\n## Closure of Recall\n- The closure of a recall typically depends on the completion of recall effectiveness checks by the FSIS, which ensures that all affected products have been removed from the market and that consumers have been adequately notified.\n- There is no specific timeline provided in the sources for when the recall will be officially closed, but it generally involves verifying that all necessary steps have been taken to remove the contaminated products from circulation.\n\nGiven the information available, it is not possible to definitively state whether the recall will be closed before November 16, 2024, as this depends on the ongoing recall effectiveness checks and other factors managed by the FSIS and Perdue Foods LLC. Therefore, the answer to this question is not immediately clear.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the recall status of Perdue Foods LLC's frozen, ready-to-eat chicken products currently listed as Active on the USDA FSIS website?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specify the current recall status as listed on the USDA FSIS website, such as whether it is active or completed. They only detail the recall announcement and the affected products. Therefore, the current status of the recall on the USDA FSIS website is unclear based on the provided sources.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any official updates since August 16, 2024, indicating progress toward closing the recall of these Perdue products?\nANSWER: There are no official updates provided in the sources since August 16, 2024, that indicate progress toward closing the recall of the Perdue products. The information available is consistent across the sources and does not include any subsequent updates or statements on the recall's status after the initial announcement.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Perdue Foods LLC completed all required recall effectiveness checks as mandated by the USDA FSIS?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is unclear whether Perdue Foods LLC has completed all required recall effectiveness checks as mandated by the USDA FSIS.\n\nThe sources indicate that the FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that the recalling firm has notified its customers and that the recalled products are no longer available to consumers. However, they do not provide a specific update on whether these checks have been completed for the recent recall of Perdue Foods LLC's chicken products.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the average duration of recalls of similar scale and nature suggest a closure within three months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information that directly addresses whether the average duration of recalls of similar scale and nature suggests a closure within three months.\n\n- The sources discuss various aspects of recall, such as the validity of end-of-day recall measures, measures to quantify the similarity of recalls, and the effects of item similarity and contextual information on recall. However, none of these sources mention a specific timeframe like three months for the closure of recalls.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any precedent of recalls involving foreign material contamination remaining active for more than three months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of recalls involving foreign material contamination that remained active for more than three months. However, the sources do discuss various types of recalls and their durations, but they do not provide detailed information on the specific duration of recalls due to foreign material contamination.\n\nFor example, the Sedgwick report mentioned in discusses recalls under USDA jurisdiction, including those due to foreign material contamination, but it does not specify the duration of these recalls. Similarly, other sources,, and discuss various types of recalls and their causes, but they do not provide the specific duration for foreign material contamination recalls.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as the provided sources do not offer sufficient information to determine if recalls involving foreign material contamination have remained active for more than three months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have all affected products been confirmed as removed from commerce by the USDA FSIS?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not confirm that all affected products have been completely removed from commerce in every case. Here are some key points:\n\n- FSIS conducts effectiveness checks to ensure that the recalling firm makes all reasonable efforts to remove the affected product from commerce. However, these checks do not guarantee that every single product is retrieved.\n- If FSIS determines that the recalling firm has been successful in contacting its consignees and has made all reasonable efforts to retrieve and control products, the Agency notifies the firm that the recall is complete. However, this does not necessarily mean every last product is removed.\n- In cases like the public health alert for illegally imported meat and poultry products from the Philippines, FSIS expresses concern that some product may still be in consumers' and restaurants' pantries and on retailers' shelves, indicating that not all affected products may have been removed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the USDA FSIS issued any statements predicting the recall will remain active beyond mid-November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the USDA FSIS has issued any statements predicting the recall will remain active beyond mid-November 2024. The sources discuss the recall details, the affected products, and the ongoing efforts to identify and notify consumers, but they do not mention any predictions or statements about the recall's duration beyond mid-November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any reported obstacles or delays that could prevent the recall from being closed before November 16, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several reported obstacles and delays that could prevent recalls from being closed before November 16, 2024:\n\n## Takata Air Bag Recall\n- The recall involves a massive number of vehicles (approximately 67 million air bags), and as of April 2024, only 88% of the airbags had been repaired or replaced, leaving many millions still at risk. This scale and the ongoing nature of the repairs suggest that completing all repairs by November 16, 2024, could be challenging.\n\n## Hyundai and Kia Recall\n- Hyundai and Kia issued a recall of 3.4 million vehicles in September, but due to the huge number of vehicles involved and the lack of sufficient replacement parts, repairs are not expected to be completed until June or later, which is well beyond November 16, 2024.\n\n## Tesla Cybertruck Recall\n- While Tesla's recall for the Cybertruck involves a software fix, which might be quicker to implement, the company has had multiple recalls in recent months, and the complexity and volume of these recalls could potentially delay the completion of all necessary repairs.\n\nThese examples indicate significant delays and obstacles in completing the recalls before the specified date.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any legal actions or pending investigations related to this recall that could delay its closure?\nANSWER: Yes, there are legal actions and pending investigations that can delay the closure of a recall.\n\n1. **Regulatory Actions and Fines**: In the case of General Motors, the company was fined $35 million by the U.S. Department of Transportation for delays in recalling cars with defective ignition switches. This fine and the associated oversight requirements can delay the closure of a recall as the company must comply with these regulatory actions.\n\n2. **Investigations**: Multiple investigations can be ongoing, such as those by the Justice Department, congressional committees, and the Transportation Department’s inspector general, which can prolong the process of resolving a recall.\n\n3. **Class Action Lawsuits and Injury Claims**: Recalls can lead to class action lawsuits and individual injury claims, which can delay the closure of a recall as these legal proceedings are resolved. These lawsuits often require extensive evidence and legal processes, adding to the timeframe.\n\n4. **Public and Media Pressure**: High-profile recalls attract media attention, which can increase public pressure on companies to address claims promptly. However, this scrutiny can also lead to a more complex and prolonged process as companies navigate legal, public relations, and regulatory issues.\n\n5. **Oversight and Enforcement**: The lack of clear federal requirements for repair timelines and the need for regulatory bodies like the NHTSA to strengthen oversight and enforcement can lead to delays in the recall process. This includes potential financial penalties for automakers who fail to meet repair deadlines, further complicating the closure of a recall.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the USDA FSIS closed recalls similar to Perdue Foods LLC's within three months of their announcement in the past?\nANSWER: To determine if the USDA FSIS has closed recalls similar to Perdue Foods LLC's within three months of their announcement, we need to examine the recall announcements and their resolution timelines.\n\n1. **2017 Recall**: The recall announced on May 6, 2017, involved Perdue Foods LLC recalling chicken sausage products due to possible foreign matter contamination. The problem was discovered on May 5, 2017. There is no specific mention of when the recall was closed, but typically, recall effectiveness checks are ongoing to ensure the product is no longer available to consumers. However, this source does not provide a specific closure date.\n\n2. **2019 Recall**: The recall announced on May 31, 2019, involved Perdue Foods LLC recalling ready-to-eat chicken products due to possible foreign matter contamination. Again, there is no specific mention of when the recall was closed, only that FSIS conducts recall effectiveness checks.\n\n3. **2024 Recall**: The recall announced on August 16, 2024, involved Perdue Foods LLC recalling frozen, ready-to-eat chicken breast nugget and tender products due to possible foreign matter contamination. There is no information provided on the closure of this recall as it is a recent announcement.\n\nGiven the information available, none of the sources explicitly state when the recalls were officially closed or if they were closed within three months. Therefore, the answer to whether the USDA FSIS has closed similar recalls within three months of their announcement is unclear based on the provided sources.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 15 days remain until November 16, 2024.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If nothing changed, the recall would remain listed as \"Active\" on the USDA FSIS website, and the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** If there were approximately 4 days left, I would estimate a lower probability of the recall being closed by the deadline.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:** If there were 60 days remaining, I would estimate a higher probability of the recall being closed before the deadline.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- The recall was announced on August 16, 2024, which is about 2.5 months ago.\n- Typically, recalls of this nature (involving foreign material contamination) can take between 2 to 3 months to close, depending on the effectiveness of the recall process and the completion of recall effectiveness checks by the USDA FSIS.\n- Since there have been no reports of obstacles or delays, it's reasonable to assume that the recall process is progressing normally.\n- With 15 days remaining until the deadline, there is a moderate to high likelihood that the recall could be closed before November 16, 2024.\n- If the time remaining were significantly less (e.g., only 4 days), the probability would decrease due to the limited time for the USDA FSIS to complete all necessary checks.\n- Conversely, with more time (e.g., 60 days), the probability would increase as it allows for the completion of the recall process.\n\n**Probability: 70%**",
