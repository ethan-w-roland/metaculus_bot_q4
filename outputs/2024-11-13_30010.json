    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Crimean Bridge be hit with an attack before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-13\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, after October 2, 2024, and before January 1, 2025, credible sources report that the Crimean Bridge has been struck with weapons fire, explosives, or projectiles that could pose a credible threat to the integrity of the bridge.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n* The bridge must be physically struck by the weapons fire, explosives, or projectiles, attacks that are intercepted or otherwise do not strike the bridge will not count.\n* There is no requirement on how much damage the bridge must receive, the only requirement is that the strike must pose a credible threat to the integrity of the bridge. For example, a car bomb detonated on the bridge would count, while the bridge being struck with bullets of a caliber that would cause only superficial harm, or the collision of a small vessel that does not pose a threat to the integrity of the bridge do not count.\n* There is no requirement on who the attack is attributed to. Attacks attributed to or blamed on any country or group would count, including terrorism.\n* A strike on either the rail bridge or the road bridge counts.\n* A strike on the immediate bridge approaches will also count.\n* Metaculus will make a determination as to whether potentially qualifying events satisfy these criteria, and may **annul** the question if it is unclear from available reporting whether the criteria have been satisfied.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe [Crimean Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Bridge) crosses the [Kerch Strait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerch_Strait) between the Crimean peninsula and the Russian mainland. The bridge is [approximately 12 miles long](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/15/putin-opens-bridge-between-crimea-and-russian-mainland) and consists of a separated four-lane road bridge and a two-track rail bridge. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine the Crimean Bridge has been [attacked three times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Bridge#Attacks_during_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), with attacks successfully damaging the bridge in October of 2022 and July of 2023, and the third attack failing to strike the bridge in August of 2023.\n\nIn April of 2024 there were reports that Ukraine is planning another attack on the Crimean Bridge. On April 4, 2024, [The Guardian reported](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/ukraine-eyes-kerch-bridge-crimea-drone-attack):\n\n>The HUR [[Defense Intelligence of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Directorate_of_Intelligence_(Ukraine))] thinks it can disable the bridge soon. “We will do it in the first half of 2024,” one official told the Guardian, adding that Kyrylo Budanov, the head of the main directorate of intelligence, already had “most of the means to carry out this goal”. He was following a plan approved by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to “minimise” Russia’s naval presence in the Black Sea.\n\nOn April 26, 2024, [Newsweek reported](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraine-decoy-missiles-crimea-bridge-attack-rybar-1894639) that an attack could coincide with Russian President Vladimir Putin's [May 7 inauguration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Russian_presidential_election#:~:text=He%20is%20scheduled%20to%20be%20inaugurated%20on%207%20May%202024.):\n\n>[Telegram channel] Rybar said an attack on the Kerch Bridge could happen before the inauguration of Putin on May 7. The Russian leader last month secured his fifth term in office.\n>\n>\"Considering the love of the Ukrainian authorities and their curators for symbolism, the target once again may be the Crimean Bridge, the attention to which is very high,\" Rybar said.\n>\n>The analysis comes after Russian military expert Vladislav Shurygin said on state TV that he believes Ukraine will attack the Kerch Strait Bridge on May 7.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the Crimean Bridge being hit with an attack before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context and Recent Events\n- The Kerch Bridge, which connects Russia with occupied Crimea, has been a frequent target of Ukrainian attacks. It was heavily damaged in October 2022 and July 2023, and there have been ongoing attempts to strike it, including recent incidents involving drones and missiles[1][2][5].\n\n## Current Military Situation\n- Ukrainian forces have been working on a \"complex solution\" to destroy the bridge, with Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine's Military Intelligence Chief, suggesting there are chances it could be destroyed in the coming months[2].\n- The bridge remains a crucial supply route, although its military significance has been somewhat reduced according to Ukraine's Navy. However, there is a possibility that Russia may use it for weapons supplies again after any necessary repairs[2][5].\n\n## Defensive Measures\n- Russia has been fortifying the bridge with underwater barriers, increasing the number of barges to protect against Ukrainian naval drones, and using air defenses to repel attacks. Despite these measures, the bridge has still been subject to periodic closures due to security incidents[1][5].\n\n## Military Capabilities and Western Aid\n- Ukraine has been receiving Western military aid, including long-range ATACMS missiles, which could potentially be used to strike the bridge. The arrival and deployment of this weaponry are expected to impact the frontline situation, although the full effect may take some time to materialize[3].\n\n## Base Rates and Patterns\n- Given the frequent attacks on the bridge and the ongoing conflict, there is a significant base rate of attacks targeting this infrastructure. The recent history suggests that attempts to hit the bridge are not isolated incidents but part of a broader strategy by Ukrainian forces.\n\n## Time to Resolution\n- The timeframe for a potential attack is within the next few months, aligning with Budanov's comments about the likelihood of destruction in the coming months[2].\n\nConsidering these points, while it is impossible to predict with certainty whether the Crimean Bridge will be hit before January 1, 2025, the historical context, ongoing military efforts, and the strategic importance of the bridge suggest a high likelihood of continued attempts to target it. However, the success of such attempts depends on various factors, including the effectiveness of Russian defensive measures and the capabilities of Ukrainian forces.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Crimean Bridge experienced any attempted attacks that were intercepted since October 2, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about attempted attacks on the Crimean Bridge that were intercepted since October 2, 2024. The sources discuss various attacks and defensive measures up to December 2023, but they do not extend to the period after October 2, 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Crimean Bridge been attacked and damaged since May 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence of attacks on the Crimean Bridge, but the specific timeframe of May 2024 is not directly mentioned.\n\n- An attack involving 12 U.S.-made ATACMS missiles targeted the Crimean Bridge on August 15, 2024, which was repelled by Russian air defenses[3][5].\n- There were also reports of blasts and a Ukrainian drone attack in the area of the Kerch Bridge on August 16, 2024[3].\n\nHowever, there is no specific information provided about any attacks or damage to the Crimean Bridge in May 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Ukraine acquired new long-range weapons capable of striking the Crimean Bridge since October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Ukraine has developed and acquired new long-range weapons that could potentially strike targets such as the Crimean Bridge since October 2024.\n\n- Ukraine has developed an advanced missile called the Hrim-2, which has a range of more than 500 km and can deliver a payload of 500 kg with considerable accuracy. This missile was successfully test-fired in August 2024 and is capable of striking deep into Russian territory, including targets like the Crimean Bridge, without requiring permission from Western allies[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant dates or events before January 1, 2025, that might influence the timing of an attack on the Crimean Bridge?\nANSWER: There is no specific information in the provided sources that suggests any significant dates or events before January 1, 2025, that would directly influence the timing of an attack on the Crimean Bridge. The sources primarily list various holidays, celebrations, and historical anniversaries for January 2025, as well as some global events scheduled for 2025, but none of these are related to the Crimean Bridge or any potential military or geopolitical actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Ukraine publicly declared plans to attack the Crimean Bridge before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES\n\nUkraine has publicly declared plans to attack the Crimean Bridge. Various sources indicate that Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stated their intention to destroy the bridge. For example, the representative of the Main Directorate of Intelligence of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Andriy Yusov, said in August that a plan had already been developed to destroy the bridge and return Crimea[4].\n\nAdditionally, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has emphasized the strategic importance of the bridge and the need to neutralize it, and Ukrainian forces have already conducted several attacks on the bridge[2][5]. These statements and actions clearly indicate Ukraine's public declaration of plans to attack the Crimean Bridge before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent reports of increased Russian defensive measures around the Crimean Bridge since October 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent reports of increased Russian defensive measures around the Crimean Bridge since October 2024.\n\n- Russian forces have deployed advanced air defense systems, including the Pantsir-SM systems, on Tuzla Island in the Kerch Strait to enhance the protection of the Crimean Bridge. These systems are mounted on metal towers to increase their detection and engagement ranges[4][5].\n- Additional measures include the installation of barriers consisting of floating and sunken barges, anti-submarine/unmanned surface vessel (USV) nets, naval mines, and smoke generators to mask the view of the bridge[4].\n- There have also been reports of Russia constructing new structures and barriers near the bridge, including a \"mysterious structure\" and additional boom barriers, to protect against potential Ukrainian attacks[2][4].\n\nThese reports indicate ongoing efforts by Russia to bolster the defenses of the Crimean Bridge in recent times.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been an escalation in military conflict between Ukraine and Russia since October 2, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there has been an escalation in the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia since October 2, 2024.\n\n- Russian forces have intensified offensive operations in various regions, including western Donetsk Oblast, where they have been attempting to envelop Kurakhove and have made significant gains south of Kurakhove[2].\n- There have been reports of Russian forces concentrating near Kamyanske, Hulyaipole, and Robotyne in the Zaporizhzhia Oblast, preparing for intensified assaults in these areas[2].\n- Russian forces have also advanced northwest of Kreminna and seized the settlement of Novosadove, indicating continued offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line[3].\n- Additionally, there has been an increase in air strikes in southern Ukraine, with a 30 to 40 percent increase in the past two to three weeks, and daily infantry assaults in groups of 10 to 20 personnel in the Zaporizhzhia direction[2].\n\nThese activities indicate a heightened level of military activity and conflict since early October 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any foreign nations provided Ukraine with military support enhancing its capability to attack the Crimean Bridge since October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information that directly confirms whether any foreign nations have provided Ukraine with military support explicitly for the purpose of enhancing its capability to attack the Crimean Bridge since October 2024.\n\nHowever, the sources do indicate that several countries, including the United States, Germany, and Sweden, have continued to provide significant military aid to Ukraine since the start of the war. This aid includes various types of military equipment and training, some of which could potentially be used for a wide range of military operations.\n\nFor example, the United States has lifted some restrictions on the use of advanced weapons, allowing Ukraine to strike Russian military targets near the border in self-defense since June 2024[1].\nGermany has provided extensive military support, including air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, and other military equipment[4].\nSweden has also contributed significantly, including support for unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) and various military materiel[3].\n\nWhile this military aid could theoretically be used for various military objectives, there is no explicit mention of it being specifically aimed at enhancing Ukraine's capability to attack the Crimean Bridge since October 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Crimean Bridge currently fully operational without ongoing repairs as of November 13, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether the Crimean Bridge is currently fully operational without ongoing repairs as of November 13, 2024.\n\n- The sources detail multiple attacks and damages to the bridge, including explosions in October 2022, July 2023, and other incidents, which have led to periodic closures and repairs[2][3][4].\n- The bridge was fully reopened after repairs on several occasions, such as on February 23, 2023, for the road bridge, and on May 5, 2023, for the rail bridge. It was also fully reopened on October 14, 2023, after another attack[2].\n- However, there is no recent information provided in the sources that confirms the bridge's current status as of November 13, 2024, or whether any new incidents or repairs have occurred since the last reported reopening.\n\nTherefore, the current operational status of the Crimean Bridge as of November 13, 2024, remains unclear based on the available information.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the weather in the Kerch Strait area been suitable for conducting attacks on the Crimean Bridge since October 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if the weather in the Kerch Strait area has been suitable for conducting attacks on the Crimean Bridge since October 2024, we need to consider the weather conditions typical for the region during this time.\n\n- The Kerch area experiences a significant change in weather as it enters the fall and winter seasons. By October, the cloudier part of the year has already begun, and this period lasts until May[2].\n- The fall season in this region can bring increasing cloud cover, potential rainfall, and colder temperatures, which could affect military operations. Specifically, the cloud cover and precipitation can make aerial and naval operations more challenging[2].\n\nGiven the sources provided, there is no specific detailed weather data for October 2024 in Kerch. However, based on the general climate patterns:\n- The cloudier and potentially wetter conditions typical of the fall season could make some types of attacks, especially those relying on clear skies or stable weather, less suitable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\nWhile we can infer that the weather might be less favorable due to the typical fall conditions, we do not have specific weather data for October 2024 to definitively say whether the weather was suitable or not.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately **48 days** remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If current conditions persist without significant changes, the Crimean Bridge **would not be hit** with an attack before January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 12 days):** The probability of an attack would be **lower**, perhaps around **20%**.\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4 times the time left (approximately 192 days):** The probability of an attack would be **higher**, potentially around **60%**.\n\n---\n\n### **Rationale:**\n\n#### **Historical Context and Base Rates:**\n- **Previous Attacks:** The Crimean Bridge has been successfully attacked twice since the start of the conflict: in October 2022 and July 2023. There have also been unsuccessful attempts, indicating ongoing efforts by Ukraine to target the bridge.\n- **Frequency of Attacks:** This suggests a base rate of approximately one significant attack per year on the bridge.\n\n#### **Current Military Situation:**\n- **Ukrainian Intentions:** Ukrainian officials have publicly declared their intent to attack the Crimean Bridge again. Intelligence reports and statements from Ukrainian military leadership indicate plans are in place for further attempts.\n- **Escalation in Conflict:** Since October 2024, there has been an escalation in military activities, with increased offensive operations by both sides. This heightened conflict could raise the probability of attacks on strategic targets like the bridge.\n\n#### **Capabilities and Resources:**\n- **Acquisition of Long-Range Weapons:** Ukraine has developed or acquired new long-range missiles, such as the Hrim-2, capable of striking deep into occupied territory, including the Crimean Bridge.\n- **Western Military Aid:** Continued support from Western nations enhances Ukraine's overall military capabilities, potentially increasing the likelihood of a successful attack.\n\n#### **Russian Defensive Measures:**\n- **Enhanced Defenses:** Russia has fortified the bridge with advanced air defense systems, underwater barriers, and other protective measures. These defenses may reduce the probability of a successful attack.\n- **Past Effectiveness:** Despite previous defenses, Ukraine has successfully damaged the bridge, suggesting that Russian measures may not be entirely foolproof.\n\n#### **Time Constraints:**\n- **Limited Timeframe:** With only 48 days remaining, the window for conducting such a complex operation is narrowing.\n- **Operational Planning:** Coordinating an attack requires time for planning, intelligence gathering, and favorable conditions, which may be constrained during this period.\n\n#### **Environmental Factors:**\n- **Weather Conditions:** The Kerch Strait area experiences harsher weather in November and December, including increased cloud cover and precipitation. Adverse weather could impede aerial or maritime operations.\n- **Impact on Operations:** Poor weather might limit opportunities for attacks that rely on clear visibility and calm seas.\n\n#### **Significant Dates and Symbolism:**\n- **Lack of Notable Dates:** There are no specific upcoming dates before January 1, 2025, that might serve as symbolic timing for an attack, reducing the likelihood of an attack timed for maximum psychological impact.\n\n#### **Assessment Over Different Timeframes:**\n- **If Only 12 Days Left:** With a quarter of the time remaining, operational constraints and weather factors would further reduce the likelihood, leading to a lower probability (around 20%).\n- **If 192 Days Left:** Extending the timeframe to 192 days increases opportunities for planning and executing an attack under more favorable conditions, resulting in a higher probability (around 60%).\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the factors above, there remains a significant chance of an attack on the Crimean Bridge before January 1, 2025. While Ukraine has the intent and potentially the capability, the limited timeframe, enhanced Russian defenses, and seasonal weather conditions reduce the overall likelihood.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
