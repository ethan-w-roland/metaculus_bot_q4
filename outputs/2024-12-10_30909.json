    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore January 1, 2025, will Tech Crunch report new layoffs at Apple?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-10\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to Tech Crunch's tracker \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs,\" which can be accessed [here](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/tech-layoffs-2024-list/), Apple has layoffs following the launch of this question and before January 1, 2025, To resolve the question, a Metaculus Admin will go to the Tech Crunch link on or after January 1, 2025 and see if Apple appears for November 2024 or December 2024. If Apple is not listed as having a layoff event under those months, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nTech Crunch's \"comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" will be the sole source used for resolution of this question, regardless of information from other sources. If a layoff event appears in the time period listed, this question resolves as Yes, and if not, it resolves as No. \n\nAccording to Tech Crunch, \"Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2024, to be updated regularly.\" Admins to resolve this question will only be looking to see what is on the page at the time of resolution. If Tech Crunch ceases to publish updates on the resolution source following the launch of this question (regardless of what can be found elsewhere on the Tech Crunch website), this question resolves as **No**. \n\nFor ease of resolution, in this series of questions, in order to count the Tech Crunch page must specifically list the company in question, which in this case is Apple. This is true regardless of subsidiaries or ownerships. So for example, a question on Microsoft must specifically mention Microsoft, and a layoff event at LinkedIn will not count for purposes of this question (unless the subheading mentions Microsoft), even though LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nApple has had layoff events listed by Tech Crunch for February and April 2024. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of TechCrunch reporting new layoffs at Apple before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Recent Layoffs and Workforce Adjustments\nApple has already implemented several rounds of layoffs and workforce adjustments in 2024. These include:\n- The layoff of over 600 employees in California following the cancellation of the electric vehicle project (Project Titan)[4][5].\n- Relocation of the Siri evaluation team from San Diego to Austin, resulting in layoffs for those unable to relocate[2][5].\n- Cuts in the Apple Books and Apple News teams, as well as in the Apple Watch division after abandoning plans for in-house micro-LED displays[2][5].\n\n## Current Workforce Trends\nDespite these layoffs, Apple's overall employee count has grown in 2024, reaching approximately 164,000 full-time employees globally as of late September. This is back to the levels seen in 2022[2][5].\n\n## Industry Context\nThe tech industry has seen significant layoffs in 2024, with companies like Salesforce, Cisco, SAP, and Intel implementing large-scale layoffs. However, Apple has managed to avoid larger-scale layoffs compared to some of its peers[3].\n\n## Reporting Patterns\nTechCrunch has been actively reporting on Apple's workforce changes, including the recent layoffs and the NLRB findings related to labor law violations[1][4].\n\nGiven these points:\n- Apple has already made several adjustments to its workforce in 2024.\n- The company's overall employee count has still managed to grow.\n- TechCrunch has been diligent in reporting on Apple's workforce changes.\n\nWhile it is possible that Apple might make further adjustments to its workforce, there is no clear indication from the available information that new layoffs will definitely be reported by TechCrunch before January 1, 2025. However, the ongoing trends in the tech industry and Apple's past actions suggest that it is not entirely unlikely either.\n\nTo make a more informed prediction, a superforecaster would need to consider the base rate of layoffs in the tech industry, Apple's historical behavior in similar economic conditions, and any additional context that might indicate future workforce adjustments.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has TechCrunch specifically mentioned Apple in any recent layoff reports after April 2024\nANSWER: YES\n\nTechCrunch has mentioned Apple in recent layoff reports after April 2024. For instance, in August 2024, Apple was reported to be cutting around 100 jobs in its digital services group, affecting workers in the company’s Books and News teams[3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple’s global employee count decreased since September 2024\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, there is no indication that Apple’s global employee count has decreased since September 2024. The sources all report that as of late September 2024, Apple had approximately 164,000 full-time employees, and there is no mention of any layoffs or reductions after that date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has TechCrunch published any updates to its \"comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" after April 2024\nANSWER: Yes, TechCrunch has published updates to its \"comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" after April 2024. The sources indicate that there have been numerous layoffs reported in the months following April, including updates for May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and even December 2024[2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any government or regulatory pressure on Apple to reduce its workforce in late 2024\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the recent layoffs at Apple were a result of government or regulatory pressure to reduce its workforce. The layoffs are attributed to internal reasons such as the discontinuation of projects like the Apple Car and smartwatch display projects, and a shift in strategic priorities[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple announced any restructuring or reorganization of its business units in late 2024\nANSWER: Yes, Apple has announced restructuring or reorganization of its business units in late 2024.\n\n- Specifically, Apple is reorganizing the App Store in response to changing global regulations. This reorganization involves dividing the App Store into two teams, one led by Carson Oliver to oversee Apple’s own App Store, and the other led by Ann Thai to focus on alternative app distribution[1].\n\n- Additionally, there have been other restructuring efforts within Apple, such as the layoff of 600 employees and the discontinuation of projects in the automotive and smartwatch sectors, although these are not specifically dated to late 2024 but are part of broader restructuring initiatives[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple reported any negative financial results in the third quarter of 2024\nANSWER: NO\n\nApple's financial results for the third fiscal quarter of 2024 were positive, with the company reporting a record June quarter revenue of $85.8 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year, and a net profit of $21.45 billion, which is also an increase from the previous year. Key metrics such as earnings per share, services revenue, and operating cash flow all showed growth[1][2][4]. While there were some segments that saw slight declines, such as iPhone and Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, the overall financial performance was strong and did not include any negative financial results at the company level.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple announced any new layoffs in 2024 after April\nANSWER: Yes, Apple has announced new layoffs in 2024 after the April layoffs.\n\nIn addition to the April layoffs of over 600 employees due to the discontinuation of the Apple Car and micro-LED display projects, Apple also conducted other rounds of layoffs later in the year. For example, in August, Apple cut around 100 jobs in its digital services division, primarily affecting the Apple Books app, Apple Bookstore, and the Apple News teams[2][3][4]. Additionally, there were layoffs related to the relocation of a Siri evaluation team from San Diego to Austin, Texas, where some employees who did not wish to relocate were laid off[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple faced any new legal issues in late 2024 that could impact employment\nANSWER: Yes, Apple has faced several new legal issues in late 2024 that could impact employment.\n\n- Apple is facing a lawsuit under California's Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) alleging violations of labor laws, including restrictions on employee speech, invasion of employee privacy through surveillance, and unlawful wage clawbacks[2][4].\n- The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has issued complaints accusing Apple of maintaining unlawful workplace rules that violate employees' rights to organize and discuss pay equity. These complaints include allegations of suppressing employee discussions on wages and working conditions, and enforcing overly broad confidentiality and non-compete agreements[3][5].\n- Additionally, there are allegations of Apple retaliating against employees who attempted to discuss pay equity and other work-related issues, which further highlights the ongoing labor rights issues[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the overall trend of layoffs in the tech industry continuing in December 2024\nANSWER: The overall trend of layoffs in the tech industry appears to be continuing into December 2024, although the specific sources provided do not give detailed layoff numbers for December itself. Here are some points that indicate the ongoing trend:\n\n- The sources mention that layoffs have been consistent throughout 2024, with significant job cuts in various months[1][2][5].\n- Companies like Tidal, X, Coursera, and others were still conducting layoffs in October and November 2024, suggesting the trend has not abated[1].\n- The general context provided indicates that the tech industry is continuing to face economic pressures, cost-cutting measures, and restructuring efforts, which are likely to result in ongoing layoffs[2][4].\n\nWhile there is no specific data for December 2024 layoffs in the sources, the continuous nature of the layoffs throughout the year suggests that the trend is likely to continue. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple launched any new projects or products in late 2024 that might affect its workforce\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the relevant points regarding new projects or products and their potential impact on Apple's workforce in late 2024:\n\n## New Products and Projects\n- Apple is releasing several new products in 2024, including the Apple Vision Pro (an AR/VR headset), new iPhone models (iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro), a new iPhone SE, updated iPads, new Macs, and redesigned Apple Watch and AirPods[1][3][4].\n\n## Impact on Workforce\n- Apple has been focusing on automating its iPhone assembly lines, which is expected to reduce the workforce on final assembly lines by up to 50% over the next few years. This automation effort is already showing a decline in the number of workers at Apple’s manufacturing partners[5].\n\n## Conclusion\nYes, Apple has launched new projects and products in late 2024, and these initiatives, particularly the automation of iPhone assembly lines, are likely to affect its workforce by reducing the number of workers involved in these processes.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n22 days (from December 10, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n**(b) Outcome if nothing changed:**  \nNo. If the current situation remains unchanged with no new layoffs announced or reported after the latest in August 2024, TechCrunch would not report new layoffs at Apple before January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 5 days remaining, the likelihood of new layoffs being reported is relatively low due to the short timeframe. **Probability: 20%**\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith 88 days remaining, there would be ample time for potential new layoffs and subsequent reporting by TechCrunch, especially considering the ongoing industry trends and Apple's recent restructuring efforts. **Probability: 60%**\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the current date of December 10, 2024, there are only 22 days left until the resolution date of January 1, 2025. Apple has previously announced layoffs in 2024, with the most recent being in August. Despite these layoffs, Apple's overall employee count has remained stable since September 2024, suggesting that while layoffs have occurred, they have not yet led to a net decrease in staff.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n1. **Recent Layoffs:** Apple has conducted layoffs up to August 2024, but there have been no reports of additional layoffs since then. The overall employee count has not declined since September, indicating stabilization in workforce numbers.\n\n2. **TechCrunch Reporting Patterns:** TechCrunch has been diligent in reporting Apple's workforce changes. However, with only 22 days left, the window for significant new layoffs and their subsequent reporting is limited.\n\n3. **Industry Trends:** The tech industry continues to experience layoffs, which could influence Apple's decisions. However, Apple's sustained employee count growth suggests resilience against larger-scale layoffs compared to some peers.\n\n4. **Company Restructuring and Projects:** Apple's ongoing restructuring efforts and new project launches, such as automation in assembly lines, may impact future workforce needs. While these factors indicate potential for future layoffs, the close proximity to the resolution date limits the likelihood of such events being reported in the remaining timeframe.\n\n5. **Timeframe Impact:** The probability assessment changes significantly with the timeframe. With only 5 days remaining, the likelihood of new layoffs being announced and reported is low. Conversely, with an extended period of 88 days, there is more opportunity for workforce adjustments and reporting by TechCrunch.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nConsidering the limited time left, stable employee numbers since September, and the absence of recent layoffs beyond August, the probability that TechCrunch will report new layoffs at Apple by January 1, 2025, remains relatively low. However, acknowledging the ongoing industry pressures and potential internal restructuring, there remains a modest chance of additional layoffs being announced within the remaining 22 days.\n\n**Probability: 30%**",
