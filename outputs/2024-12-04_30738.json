    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill November 2024 have a global temperature increase of <1.25 degrees?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Global Land and Ocean Average Temperature Anomaly for November 2024 is less than 1.25 degrees according to NOAA at [this page](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/time-series). Region is \"Global\" and surface is \"Land and Ocean.\"\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/global-temperature-anomalies), \"The term temperature anomaly means a departure from a reference value or long-term average. A positive anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was warmer than the reference value, while a negative anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was cooler than the reference value.\" \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the available data and forecasts, it is highly unlikely that November 2024 will have a global temperature increase of less than 1.25 degrees above the pre-industrial level.\n\nHere are some key points that support this conclusion:\n\n- The global average temperature for the first 10 months of 2024 (January to October) is already 1.54°C (±0.13°C) above the pre-industrial average, and 0.71°C above the 1991-2020 average[2][3][4].\n- The past 10 months have seen exceptionally high monthly global mean temperatures, with October 2024 being the second-warmest October on record and 1.65°C above the pre-industrial level[2][3].\n- It is \"virtually certain\" that 2024 will be the warmest year on record and the first year to exceed 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels[2][3][5].\n- Given the consistent and elevated temperature anomalies throughout the year, it would be unusual for November to drop significantly below the average increase seen so far.\n\nTherefore, based on the current trends and data, it is not likely that November 2024 will see a global temperature increase of less than 1.25 degrees above the pre-industrial level.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is 2024 projected to be the warmest year on record according to NOAA forecasts?\nANSWER: Yes, 2024 is projected to be the warmest year on record according to NOAA forecasts. The NOAA/NCEI data, as reported, indicates that the January–October global surface temperature for 2024 ranked as the warmest in the 175-year record, and it is practically certain that 2024 will rank as the warmest year on record[3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the global average temperature for the first ten months of 2024 surpassed 1.5°C above the pre-industrial average?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe sources consistently indicate that the global average temperature for the first ten months of 2024 has surpassed 1.5°C above the pre-industrial average. For example, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) stated that the average global temperature for the first 10 months of 2024 was more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have scientific forecasts from leading climate authorities in 2024 indicated that a significant cooling period is expected in November?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nScientific forecasts from leading climate authorities for November 2024 do not indicate a significant cooling period. Instead, they predict the following:\n\n- Above-average temperatures are expected across the central and eastern parts of the United States and northern Alaska[1].\n- Warmer-than-usual temperatures are anticipated over the whole of Kenya, with the highest probabilities for warmer temperatures in the Central and Eastern parts of the country[2].\n- Global temperatures are expected to remain high, with 2024 virtually certain to be the warmest year on record and the first year above 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels[4][5].\n\nThere is no indication of a significant cooling period in these forecasts.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 continued to increase compared to previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the answer to whether greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 have continued to increase compared to previous years is yes, but with some specific details:\n\n- The 2024 Global Carbon Budget projects that fossil CO₂ emissions will increase by 0.8% from 2023, reaching a record high of 37.4 billion tonnes. Additionally, total CO₂ emissions, including those from land-use change, are projected to be 41.6 billion tonnes in 2024, up from 40.6 billion tonnes in 2023[1][2].\n\nTherefore, the evidence indicates that greenhouse gas emissions have indeed continued to increase in 2024 compared to the previous year.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Was the global average temperature for October 2024 one of the top three warmest Octobers on record?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nAll the sources agree that October 2024 was the second-warmest October on record globally. Here are the specific mentions:\n\n- According to Climate.gov, October 2024 was the second-warmest October on record, 0.09°F (0.05°C) below October 2023[1].\n- Copernicus Climate Change Service reported that October 2024 was the second-warmest October globally, trailing only October 2023[2].\n- Berkeley Earth also stated that October 2024 was nominally the second warmest October since records began in 1850, effectively tied with October 2023 due to the small margin of difference[3].\n- NOAA's Global Climate Report confirmed that October 2024 was the second warmest October on record for the globe[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been the presence of a strong El Niño event in 2024 that contributes to higher global temperatures?\nANSWER: Yes, there has been a strong El Niño event in 2023-2024 that contributed to higher global temperatures.\n\n- The 2023-2024 El Niño event was declared to have started in July 2023 and peaked in November 2023 - January 2024, making it one of the five strongest on record[3][4][5].\n- This event led to significant warming of the ocean surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific, which in turn contributed to a spike in global temperatures. The year 2023 was on track to be the warmest on record, and 2024 was expected to be even warmer due to the El Niño event and the ongoing impact of climate change[1][3][4].\n- The event's effects included extreme weather conditions such as heatwaves, droughts, heavy rains, and flooding, all of which were exacerbated by the El Niño event[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the global average temperature for January 2024 exceed 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level?\nANSWER: Yes, the global average temperature for January 2024 exceeded 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level.\n\n- According to the NOAA report, the January global surface temperature was 1.27°C (2.29°F) above the 20th-century average, but when compared to the pre-industrial average (1850-1900), it was 1.62°C (2.91°F) above this baseline[1][5].\n- The Berkeley Earth analysis also indicates that the global mean temperature in January 2024 was 1.62 ± 0.07 °C (2.91 ± 0.12 °F) above the 1850 to 1900 average, which is well above the 1.5°C threshold[3].\n- The Copernicus Climate Change Service report similarly notes that January 2024 was 1.66°C warmer than the January average for 1850-1900[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major nations implemented new climate policies in 2024 aimed at reducing global temperature increases?\nANSWER: While there have been significant discussions, announcements, and commitments made by major nations in 2024 regarding climate policies, the implementation of new policies is not fully clear from the sources provided.\n\n- Several countries, including the UK, Brazil, and the UAE, have announced updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) with more ambitious targets at COP29, but these announcements are about future commitments rather than the implementation of new policies in 2024 itself[2].\n- There is mention of countries being well-positioned to increase the ambition of their 2030 targets and some having made progress in reducing emissions through existing policies, but no new policies specifically implemented in 2024 are detailed[4].\n- The sources highlight the need for more ambitious and concrete actions to meet climate goals, but they do not provide specific examples of new climate policies implemented in 2024[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a continued trend of high monthly global mean temperatures throughout 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a continued trend of high monthly global mean temperatures throughout 2024 as indicated by several sources:\n\n1. **Global Average Temperature**: It is virtually certain that 2024 will be the warmest year on record, with the global average temperature expected to be more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The January-October global surface temperature ranked warmest in the 175-year record, with an average temperature anomaly of 1.28°C above the 1901-2000 average[3][4][5].\n\n2. **Monthly Records**: Seven of the nine months of 2024 for which data is available have seen record warm temperatures. October 2024 was the second warmest October on record globally, following October 2023[3][4][5].\n\n3. **Consistent Warming**: The long-term warming trend is evident, with the past 10 years being the warmest on record. The year-to-date temperature anomalies for 2024 have been consistently higher than the previous year, indicating a continued trend of high monthly global mean temperatures[2][3][5].\n\nThese sources collectively indicate that 2024 is experiencing a sustained trend of high global mean temperatures.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant volcanic eruptions in 2024 that could have a cooling effect on global temperatures?\nANSWER: To determine if there have been any significant volcanic eruptions in 2024 that could have a cooling effect on global temperatures, we need to consider eruptions that release large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) or other aerosols into the stratosphere, as these can reflect sunlight and cool the Earth.\n\nFrom the provided sources:\n\n- The Global Volcanism Program lists several eruptions in 2024, but it does not specifically mention the release of significant amounts of SO2 or stratospheric injection of aerosols for most of these eruptions[1][2].\n- The Wikipedia article on volcanic eruptions in the 21st century does not detail any 2024 eruptions with a high VEI (Volcanic Explosivity Index) or significant stratospheric aerosol injection that would indicate a cooling effect on global temperatures[3].\n- The specific eruptions mentioned, such as those at Ruang, Lewotobi, and the Sundhnúkur eruptions, do not indicate the release of substantial stratospheric aerosols that would have a global cooling effect[1][3][4].\n\nGiven the information available, there is no clear evidence of significant volcanic eruptions in 2024 that would have a cooling effect on global temperatures.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately **1 month** remains until the outcome is determined, with the potential extension to January 7, 2025, if there are access issues to the resolution source.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current trends continue without any significant alterations, it is **highly likely** that **November 2024 will have a global temperature increase of ≥1.25°C** above the pre-industrial level. The existing temperature anomalies and ongoing climate patterns suggest that such a threshold will not be breached.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only **approximately 1 week** left until resolution, the forecast remains largely unchanged. The temperature data up to October 2024 already indicate elevated anomalies, and a significant cooling in November to bring the annual increase below 1.25°C is **extremely unlikely**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nIf there were **4 months** remaining until resolution, the forecast would still reflect a **low probability** of achieving a global temperature increase below 1.25°C for November 2024. The persistent high temperature trends and lack of indicators for substantial cooling maintain the assessment of improbability.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe comprehensive data and analyses provided indicate a sustained and significant increase in global temperatures throughout 2024. With the first ten months recording an average of 1.54°C above pre-industrial levels and October 2024 being the second-warmest October on record, the likelihood of a notable temperature drop in November is minimal. Additionally, ongoing factors such as a strong El Niño event and increasing greenhouse gas emissions further reduce the chances of reversing the warming trend for November 2024. The absence of significant volcanic activity that could induce global cooling also supports the expectation of continued high temperature anomalies.\n\nGiven these considerations, the probability that **November 2024 will have a global temperature increase of <1.25°C** is **very low**.\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
