{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the New York Yankees lose the 2024 World Series in baseball in exactly 7 games?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-23\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the New York Yankees lose the 2024 World Series in exactly 7 games played in the Series, as reported by [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) such as [Major League Baseball](https://www.mlb.com/news/2024-mlb-playoff-and-world-series-schedule). If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe World Series is a best-of-7 series, and in the event of an edge case such as the Series being shortened to fewer games, lengthened to more games (as happened [in 1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_World_Series) or the Series being canceled (as happened [in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_World_Series) due to a player strike) or excessively delayed, this question will resolve as **No** if the Yankees have not both lost the World Series and done it in exactly 7 games, before January 1, 2025. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe 2024 baseball World Series is scheduled to begin on October 25, 2024, between the  NY Yankees, who are the American League champions, and the LA Dodgers, who are the champions of the National League.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the New York Yankees will lose the 2024 World Series in exactly 7 games, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Context\nThe Yankees and Dodgers have a rich history, having faced each other 11 times in the World Series prior to 2024. However, past outcomes do not directly predict future results, but they can provide some context. For example, in several of these series, the Yankees have won in various game counts, including some that went the full seven games.\n\n## Current Team Dynamics\n- The Yankees have a strong offense led by Giancarlo Stanton, Juan Soto, and Aaron Judge, which has been crucial in their postseason run. However, their success also depends on their pitching rotation and bullpen performance.\n- The Dodgers, favored to win the series at -125 odds, have home-field advantage due to their superior regular-season record. They have a powerful lineup and a deep bullpen, despite some concerns about their pitching rotation's consistency.\n\n## Series Format\nThe World Series is a seven-game series with a 2-3-2 format, meaning the team with home-field advantage (the Dodgers) will host Games 1, 2, 6, and 7 if necessary. This format does not inherently favor one team to win in exactly seven games, but it does give the Dodgers an edge in terms of home-field advantage.\n\n## Predictions and Odds\nWhile the Dodgers are favored to win, the series is expected to be closely contested. Predictions are split, but there is no clear indication that the Yankees will lose in exactly seven games. The outcome will depend on various factors such as pitching performances, offensive production, and managerial decisions.\n\nGiven these points, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the Yankees will lose the 2024 World Series in exactly 7 games. The series is highly competitive, and multiple factors will influence the outcome. Therefore, the answer cannot be clearly determined as yes or no based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the 2024 World Series format still consist of a best-of-seven game series?\nANSWER: YES, the 2024 World Series format still consists of a best-of-seven game series. This is confirmed by multiple sources, including the format description for the World Series in the 2024 MLB playoffs.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the New York Yankees lost more games than the LA Dodgers during the 2024 regular season?\nANSWER: No, the New York Yankees did not lose more games than the LA Dodgers during the 2024 regular season. The Yankees finished with a 94-68 record, while the Dodgers finished with a 98-64 record. This means the Yankees lost 68 games and the Dodgers lost 64 games.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the New York Yankees' pitching rotation statistically weaker than that of the LA Dodgers in the 2024 season?\nANSWER: To determine if the New York Yankees' pitching rotation is statistically weaker than that of the LA Dodgers in the 2024 season, we would need to compare various statistical metrics such as ERA, wins, strikeouts, and other performance indicators for both teams' pitching rotations.\n\nHowever, the provided sources only offer details about the New York Yankees' pitching rotation and do not include any comparative data or statistics for the LA Dodgers' pitching rotation.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the LA Dodgers known for stronger performance in home games compared to away games in the 2024 season?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the home and away records for the 2024 Los Angeles Dodgers:\n\n- Home record: 52-29 (0.642 winning percentage)\n- Away record: 46-35 (0.568 winning percentage)\n\nSince the Dodgers had a higher winning percentage at home (0.642) compared to away (0.568), it can be concluded that they performed stronger in home games than in away games during the 2024 season.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the New York Yankees shown a pattern of close, competitive games in the 2024 postseason leading up to the World Series?\nANSWER: Yes, the New York Yankees have shown a pattern of close, competitive games in the 2024 postseason leading up to the World Series.\n\n- In the ALDS against the Kansas City Royals, the Yankees won the series 3-1, with their victories coming by margins of one, one, and two runs.\n- In the ALCS against the Cleveland Guardians, the Yankees won the series 4-1, but the games were often closely contested. For example, Game 3 was won by the Guardians in 10 innings, and the Yankees' wins in Games 2 and 4 were by three runs each.\n\nThese details indicate that many of the Yankees' postseason games have been tight and competitive.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do credible sources predict that the 2024 World Series will go to a full seven games?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no consistent prediction from credible sources that the 2024 World Series will necessarily go to a full seven games.\n\n- The Yahoo Sports article discusses various factors that could influence the series but does not make a specific prediction about the number of games.\n- The BettingPros article provides picks and predictions but does not specify if the series will go to seven games.\n- The New York Times/Athletic article also includes expert predictions, but it does not mention a consensus on the series going to seven games.\n- The Reddit discussion includes various user predictions, but none of these are from credible sources and do not provide a unified view on the number of games.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the LA Dodgers favored to win the 2024 World Series according to current betting odds?\nANSWER: Based on the current betting odds, the answer is unclear because the sources provide conflicting information:\n\n- Some sources indicate that the Los Angeles Dodgers are favored to win the 2024 World Series. For example, and mention that the Dodgers have favorable odds, with the Dodgers at -125 and -120 respectively.\n- However, other sources suggest that the New York Yankees are currently favored. For instance, and indicate that the Yankees have shorter odds to win the World Series.\n\nGiven this conflicting information, it is unclear which team is definitively favored according to the current betting odds.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a high likelihood of weather events or other disruptions that could cancel or shorten the 2024 World Series?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several indications that suggest a potential for disruptions to the 2024 World Series due to weather events:\n\n1. **Historical Precedents**: The article from AccuWeather highlights several instances where weather events significantly impacted previous World Series games, including rain delays and suspensions.\n\n2. **Current Weather Risks**: The report from Everstream Analytics indicates that extreme weather events are the top risk facing various sectors in 2024, including potential disruptions to events due to severe weather conditions.\n\n3. **Recent Weather Disruptions**: The 2024 Little League Softball World Series was delayed due to severe weather from Tropical Storm Debby, showing that significant weather events can impact sporting events in 2024.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that there is a high likelihood of weather events or other disruptions that could potentially cancel or shorten the 2024 World Series.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the New York Yankees lost in exactly seven games in any of their previous World Series appearances?\nANSWER: Yes, the New York Yankees have lost in exactly seven games in several of their previous World Series appearances.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n- In 1957, the Yankees lost to the Milwaukee Braves in the World Series, 4-3.\n- In 1964, the Yankees lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series, 4-3.\n- In 2003, the Yankees lost to the Florida Marlins in the World Series, 4-2, but this is not exactly seven games. However, another instance is in 2004 when they lost to the Boston Red Sox in the ALCS, not the World Series, but in 1956 and other years they did play seven games in the World Series and lost.\n\nSpecifically, the 1957 and 1964 World Series are examples where the Yankees lost in exactly seven games.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do the New York Yankees have any key players currently injured who will miss the 2024 World Series?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the key points regarding injuries that could impact the New York Yankees' participation in the 2024 World Series:\n\n## Nestor Cortes\n- Cortes is on the 15-day injured list with a left elbow flexor strain but is expected to be available for the World Series if the Yankees advance.\n\n## DJ LeMahieu\n- LeMahieu is on the 10-day injured list with a hip injury, but there is no clear indication that he will definitely miss the World Series.\n\n## Lou Trivino\n- Trivino is on the 60-day injured list after undergoing Tommy John surgery and will not be available for the 2024 season, including the World Series.\n\n## JT Brubaker\n- Brubaker is also on the 60-day injured list after undergoing Tommy John surgery and will not be available for the 2024 season, including the World Series.\n\n## Jonathan Lo\u00e1isiga\n- Lo\u00e1isiga is on the 60-day injured list with a torn UCL in his right elbow and will not be available for the 2024 season, including the World Series.\n\nGiven this information, the key players who will definitely miss the 2024 World Series due to their injuries are:\n\n- Lou Trivino\n- JT Brubaker\n- Jonathan Lo\u00e1isiga\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 2 weeks. The World Series starts on October 25, 2024, and if it goes to a full seven games, it will conclude by early November 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If nothing changes, the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers will play the World Series starting October 25. Based on current team dynamics and historical data, there's an estimated 16% chance that the Yankees will lose the World Series in exactly 7 games.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** If only a quarter of the time was left (e.g., approaching Games 6 and 7), the forecast would significantly depend on the series standing. If the series were tied 3-3, there would be a 50% chance the Yankees lose in exactly 7 games. If the Yankees were trailing or leading, the probability would adjust accordingly.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** If there were four times the time left (e.g., several months before the World Series), the forecast would account for more uncertainties like season performance, potential injuries, and trades. The estimated probability might be slightly lower due to increased uncertainties but would remain in a similar range, perhaps around 15%.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Probability of the Yankees Losing the World Series:**\n   - The Dodgers are slightly favored to win, with an estimated **60% chance** of winning the series based on their stronger regular-season record, home-field advantage, and current team dynamics.\n   - The Yankees have key players injured who will miss the World Series, which could negatively impact their performance.\n\n2. **Probability of the Series Going to Exactly 7 Games:**\n   - Historically, about **31%** of World Series have gone to a full seven games.\n   - Given the competitiveness of both teams and the Yankees' pattern of close postseason games, the chance of the series going to seven games is slightly higher, estimated at **33%**.\n\n3. **Combined Probability:**\n   - **Probability the Yankees lose in exactly 7 games:**\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{Yankees lose in 7 games}) = P(\\text{Series goes 7 games}) \\times P(\\text{Yankees lose given it goes 7 games})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = 33\\% \\times 60\\% = 19.8\\%\n     \\]\n   - **Adjusting for Potential Disruptions:**\n     - There's a small chance (estimated at **5%**) that the series could be canceled or shortened due to high likelihood of disruptive weather events or other factors, in which case the question resolves as **No**.\n     - Adjusted probability:\n       \\[\n       P(\\text{Yankees lose in 7 games and series not canceled}) = 95\\% \\times 19.8\\% = 18.81\\%\n       \\]\n\n4. **Final Estimate:**\n   - Considering all factors, the estimated probability rounds to approximately **19%**.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 19%**", "probability": 19}
