    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the US national average retail price of regular gasoline be less than $3.020 for the week of December 9, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports Weekly U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Price of less than $3.020 for the week of December 9, 2024.  The resolution source can be accessed through [this link](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epmr_pte_nus_dpg&f=w). If the value is greater than or equal to that amount, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf data from US EIA is not available, Metaculus may select a similar source of data or annul the question at their discretion. If EIA changes its reporting weeks, the week closest to the date mentioned in the Resolution Criteria will be used.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gas_proc-methods.php), \"Every Monday, EIA collects information on retail prices for regular, midgrade, and premium grades of gasoline from a sample of retail gasoline outlets across the United States using Form EIA-878, Motor Gasoline Price Survey Schedule A. The weekly survey is designed to collect data on the cash price offered at the pump (including taxes) to consumers for each grade of gasoline. The data collected represent the price as of 8:00 a.m. local time on Monday, for the self-serve price except in areas having only full-serve, and the cash price except for outlets accepting only credit cards.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will be less than $3.020 for the week of December 9, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Prices\nAs of November 25, 2024, the national average price for regular gasoline was $3.166 per gallon, which is down from $3.414 a year ago[4].\n\n## Recent Trends\nGas prices have been trending downward, with a decrease of 7.26% from the same time last year. However, the change from the previous week was only a 0.06% decrease[4].\n\n## Monthly Fluctuations\nThroughout 2024, gas prices have fluctuated, with the highest average price in April at $3.61 per gallon and a subsequent decrease to $3.14 per gallon in October. The prices have generally been lower than in 2023, with an average of $3.08 per gallon as of November 13, 2024[2].\n\n## Forecast and Predictions\nGasBuddy predicts that gas prices will continue to remain lower in 2024, with an expected average of $3.38 per gallon for the year. They also forecast that the monthly national average will not exceed $3.67 in any single month and will drop to $2.99 by December 2024[1].\n\n## Potential Influencers\nSeveral factors could influence gas prices, including global conflicts, weather events, and decisions by OPEC+. However, the current trend and forecasts suggest a continued decline in prices[1][3].\n\nGiven these points, while it is possible that gas prices could drop further, the current average price of $3.166 per gallon as of November 25, 2024, and the forecasted averages for the remainder of the year suggest that it is uncertain whether the price will be less than $3.020 for the week of December 9, 2024. However, the downward trend and GasBuddy's predictions do indicate a likelihood of lower prices, making it plausible but not guaranteed.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OPEC+ maintained or increased its oil production levels in December 2024?\nANSWER: NO, OPEC+ has not maintained or increased its oil production levels in December 2024. Instead, the group has agreed to delay a planned increase in oil output by one month, extending the current production cuts until the end of December 2024[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there no significant increase in gasoline demand during the week of December 9, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about gasoline demand for the week of December 9, 2024. The sources discuss general trends and forecasts for oil and natural gas demand for 2024 and 2025, but they do not provide detailed data for specific weeks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been no new taxes or regulations implemented that would increase gasoline prices in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of new taxes or regulations implemented in December 2024 that would increase gasoline prices. The sources discuss price adjustments due to market factors such as changes in crude oil prices, currency fluctuations, and demand, but they do not mention any new taxes or regulations.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US increased its domestic oil production in November and December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no specific data provided for the months of November and December 2024 regarding the exact levels of U.S. domestic oil production for those months.\n\n- The sources provide forecasts and data up to August 2024, and some forecasts for the full year 2024, but they do not include detailed monthly production figures for November and December 2024[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there no significant global conflicts affecting oil supply in December 2024?\nANSWER: NO, there are significant global conflicts and tensions that could affect oil supply in December 2024.\n\n- Tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran, have the potential to disrupt oil supplies. There have been threats of targeting Iran's oil production facilities, and ongoing conflicts in the region could escalate and impact oil production and exports[2][3][4].\n- The recent escalation in Middle Eastern conflicts has already led to fears of major production disruptions, and analysts note that a broader regional conflict could result in long-term disruptions in the oil markets[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there no planned maintenance shutdowns at major US refineries during December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is indication that planned maintenance at major US refineries is not limited to the first half of 2024 and may extend into later parts of the year, including December.\n\n- A source mentions that upcoming maintenance work will also be concentrated in late December and early 2025, rather than just in the fall of the current year[3].\n- Another source notes that Delek typically conducts its plant maintenance in the fourth quarter, which includes December[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nNO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the price of crude oil per barrel decreased in November 2024 compared to October 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the price of crude oil per barrel has decreased in November 2024 compared to October 2024.\n\n- According to the IEA report, Brent crude oil futures peaked at $80.90/bbl early in October but fell to around $72/bbl by mid-November[5].\n- Similarly, Statista reports that the Brent crude oil price stood at around $73.58 on November 25, which is a decrease from the higher prices seen in early October[3].\n- Trading Economics also indicates a decline in crude oil prices from the beginning of October to November 2024[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the national average price for regular gasoline decreasing compared to the previous week?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the relevant information:\n\n- From the AAA Fuel Prices, the current average price for regular gasoline is $3.037 as of December 3, 2024, and it was $3.047 the previous day, which suggests a slight decrease. However, this comparison is on a daily basis rather than a weekly basis[1][2].\n- The YCharts source provides a weekly average and indicates that the US Retail Gas Price was at $3.166 as of November 25, 2024, and $3.168 the week before. This shows a decrease of -0.06% from the previous week[3].\n\nGiven the weekly data from YCharts, it is clear that the national average price for regular gasoline is decreasing compared to the previous week.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there no major weather events expected to disrupt oil production or distribution in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear that there will be no major weather events disrupting oil production or distribution in December 2024. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- The sources indicate that La Niña is expected to develop in the summer and fall of 2024, which can lead to an increase in the number of hurricanes along the Atlantic coast of the United States and in the Gulf of Mexico. This could potentially disrupt oil production and distribution even though the peak hurricane season is typically earlier in the year[1][2].\n- While the peak hurricane season may have passed by December, La Niña's effects can still lead to extreme weather events, and the sources do not specifically rule out the possibility of significant weather events in December[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has gasoline inventory in the US increased compared to the same week last year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the relevant information:\n\n- As of June 23, U.S. gasoline inventories were at 222.0 million barrels, which is about the same as the same time last year. However, East Coast gasoline inventories had increased by 2.3 million barrels (4%) compared to the same time last year[1].\n- For the period between April 19 and June 21, U.S. gasoline inventories increased to 233.9 million barrels, essentially equal to the previous five-year average, but this does not directly compare to the same week last year[4].\n\nHowever, the most recent data provided in the sources does not give a direct comparison to the same week last year for the current period (November 2024). The sources do indicate recent increases in gasoline inventories but do not specify if these are higher than the same week in the previous year.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether gasoline inventory in the US has increased compared to the same week last year, based on the provided sources, is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n5 days (from December 4, 2024, to December 9, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf current trends continue without any new influencing factors, the national average retail price of regular gasoline would likely remain around $3.166 per gallon, which is above the $3.020 threshold.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith only about 1-2 days left, immediate factors such as latest inventory reports, any sudden supply disruptions, or last-minute policy changes could have minimal impact. The forecast would slightly lean towards maintaining the current price, suggesting a low probability of dropping below $3.020.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nWith approximately 20 days, there would be more opportunity for market dynamics to influence prices. Factors such as changes in crude oil prices, potential geopolitical developments, or unexpected changes in gasoline demand could play a more significant role. This longer timeframe would introduce greater uncertainty and potentially allow for the price to dip below $3.020, but it would still be contingent on favorable conditions aligning.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe current national average price of regular gasoline stands at $3.166 as of November 25, 2024, showing a slight downward trend. Forecasts from GasBuddy predict an average of $3.38 for the year with expectations of dropping to $2.99 by December 2024. However, several factors introduce uncertainty:\n\n1. **OPEC+ Production Cuts:** OPEC+ has delayed increasing oil output, which could sustain upward pressure on prices.\n2. **Global Conflicts:** Tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Israel and Iran, pose risks of supply disruptions that could drive prices up.\n3. **Refinery Maintenance:** Scheduled maintenance in December at major US refineries could constrain supply, contributing to higher prices.\n4. **Crude Oil Prices:** Although there has been a decrease in crude oil prices from October to November, the recent geopolitical tensions and maintenance activities might offset these gains.\n5. **Inventory Levels:** Current gasoline inventory data is unclear regarding significant increases compared to the previous year, adding to uncertainty.\n6. **Weather Factors:** Potential weather events, although not confirmed, could disrupt distribution networks.\n\nGiven the short timeframe of 5 days until the resolution, substantial changes in market dynamics are less likely. While there is a downward trend, the aforementioned factors provide substantial headwinds that may prevent the price from dropping below the $3.020 mark. The prediction must balance the positive trend forecasts against the immediate risks of supply constraints and geopolitical tensions.\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
