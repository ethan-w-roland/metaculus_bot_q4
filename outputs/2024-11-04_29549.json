    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill lab-grown complex vital organs be used successfully in humans before 2025?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nBefore January 1, 2025, will any human live without the assistance of medical life support for at least 100 days after the implantation of a lab-grown heart, liver (or a substantial part of the liver), kidney or lung?\n\nAll transplantations need to be considered by medical professionals to have a substantial positive effect on the patient's health, relative to the counterfactual case in which the patient did not receive the transplantation.\n\nFor the purposes of this question, 'lab-grown' includes organs cultivated inside a living organism so long as the organs are not naturally ocurring; that is, not merely an organ taken from a non-human and implanted in a human without there having been substantial bioengineering involved to alter the harvested organs.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n*related question on Metaculus:*\n\n* [Will lab-grown complex vital organs be used successfully in humans before 2025?](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1640/will-lab-grown-complex-vital-organs-be-used-successfully-in-humans-before-2025/)\n\nMore than 30,000 organ transplants are performed each year in the United States alone, according to 2015 data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Around the world, the total was estimated to be 135,860 in 2016 according to the [Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation.](http://www.transplant-observatory.org/)\n\nHowever, the demand for donor organs often significantly exceeds the supply, meaning that many patients have to wait for a significant period of time before receiving an acceptable donor organ. Many, tragically, die waiting.\n\nIn response to this problem, multiple efforts are underway around the world to create acceptable donor organs in laboratories. There have been reported successes for simpler tissue structures including [vaginas](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-26885335), [urethras](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12666171), and [bladders](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-45470799), but so far there have been no attempts in humans for hearts, livers, kidneys or lungs - though [lab-grown lungs have been implanted into pigs](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/scientists-transplant-lab-grown-bioengineered-lungs-pigs) and [functional human “mini-kidneys”](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/human-kidney-grown-mouse-stem-cells-urine-medical-first-scientists-functioning-tissue-cells-manchester-university-a8202856.html) capable of filtering blood to produce urine have been grown in mice.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the current state of research and the challenges outlined in the sources, it is highly unlikely that lab-grown complex vital organs will be used successfully in humans before 2025.\n\n### Current State of Research\n- While significant progress has been made in growing simple organs and organoids from stem cells, the generation of fully functional, complex organs for human transplantation remains a challenging goal. Simple organs like bladders have been successfully grown and transplanted, but complex organs such as kidneys, livers, and hearts are still in the experimental phase.\n\n### Technical Challenges\n- One of the major hurdles is replicating the complex structures and functions of natural organs. For example, creating the necessary vasculature and ensuring the organ functions as it should in the body is a significant challenge.\n- Scaling up from small organoids to full-sized organs, such as scaling up to 600 million air sacs to reproduce the function of a lung, is another significant obstacle.\n\n### Timeframe Estimates\n- Experts estimate that fully functioning bioprinted organs could be available in about a decade or more, considering the current pace of progress and the need to overcome various technical and regulatory hurdles.\n\n### Ethical and Regulatory Considerations\n- There are also ethical and regulatory issues that need to be addressed, including ensuring the safety of the technologies and navigating complex ethical discussions.\n\nGiven these factors, it is clear that while the field is advancing rapidly, the successful use of lab-grown complex vital organs in humans before 2025 is not likely. The timeframe for such advancements is generally projected to be longer, often cited as within the next decade or more.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 2023, have any lab-grown hearts been successfully transplanted into humans?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, there is no evidence to suggest that lab-grown hearts have been successfully transplanted into humans. The sources provided discuss the transplantation of genetically modified pig hearts into humans, but they do not mention the transplantation of lab-grown hearts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 2023, have any lab-grown livers been successfully transplanted into humans?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, there is no evidence to suggest that lab-grown livers have been successfully transplanted into humans. The sources discuss various experiments and advancements in using genetically modified pig organs and bioengineered organs, but they do not mention the successful transplantation of lab-grown livers into humans.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any regulatory bodies approved clinical trials for lab-grown complex vital organs in humans to be conducted before 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that any regulatory bodies have approved clinical trials for lab-grown complex vital organs in humans to be conducted before 2025.\n\n- The sources mention that bio-artificial organs are currently at the preclinical stage and are being tested in laboratory settings or animal studies, with no mention of approved human clinical trials.\n- There is discussion about the need for ethical guidance and regulatory frameworks for such trials, but no approval has been noted.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 2023, have any lab-grown kidneys been successfully transplanted into humans?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, there have been no successful transplants of lab-grown kidneys into humans. The research on growing human kidneys in pigs, while promising, is still in the experimental stage and has not yet resulted in kidneys that are ready for transplantation into patients.\n\nHowever, there have been transplants of genetically edited pig kidneys into humans, which is a different approach from growing human kidneys in labs.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any companies or research groups announced imminent plans to transplant lab-grown complex vital organs into humans before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that any companies or research groups have announced imminent plans to transplant lab-grown complex vital organs into humans before January 1, 2025.\n\nThe sources discuss the progress in regenerative medicine and the potential for lab-grown organs, but they do not mention any specific plans for human transplantation of complex vital organs in the near future, particularly before January 1, 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 2023, have any lab-grown lungs been successfully transplanted into humans?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, there is no evidence to suggest that lab-grown lungs have been successfully transplanted into humans. The sources provided discuss various advancements in bioengineering and the development of lab-grown lung tissue, but these are still in the experimental stages and have not yet been transplanted into humans.\n\n- The study on bioengineered lungs using mouse models and human endothelial cells has shown promising results in animal models, but not in humans.\n- Frontier Bio's lab-grown lung tissue and other similar developments are focused on creating models for drug testing and disease research, and while they hold promise for future transplants, they have not yet been used in human transplants.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any ongoing or planned human clinical trials involving transplantation of lab-grown complex vital organs scheduled to be completed before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence of ongoing or planned human clinical trials involving the transplantation of lab-grown complex vital organs that are scheduled to be completed before January 1, 2025.\n\n- The sources discuss preclinical research, animal studies, and the development of bio-artificial organs, but they do not mention any human clinical trials that are imminent or scheduled for completion by the specified date.\n- The research is still in the preclinical phase, focusing on overcoming various technical and ethical hurdles before proceeding to human trials.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a recent breakthrough in organ bioengineering since 2021 that significantly accelerates the timeline for human transplantation of lab-grown complex vital organs before January 2025?\nANSWER: While there have been significant advancements in organ bioengineering since 2021, it is unclear if these breakthroughs have accelerated the timeline for the human transplantation of lab-grown complex vital organs to the point of being ready before January 2025.\n\nHere are some key points:\n\n- Gene-edited pig organs have been used in human transplantation, with a notable case of a pig heart transplant in 2022, but this is still in the experimental phase and not yet widely available.\n- Advances in 3D bioprinting, organoids, and stem cell technologies are ongoing, but these are still in the early stages of development and not yet ready for widespread clinical use.\n- The creation of complex organs from the ground up, such as 3D-printed scaffolds and organoids from stem cells, is being explored, but these technologies are still in the early stages of research and development.\n\nGiven the current state of these technologies, it is uncertain whether they will be ready for human transplantation of lab-grown complex vital organs before January 2025.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have lab-grown complex vital organs been successfully transplanted into large animal models demonstrating results that indicate near-term potential for human trials?\nANSWER: The current state of research in lab-grown organs indicates that while significant progress has been made, the successful transplantation of complex vital organs into large animal models with results suggesting near-term potential for human trials is still in the early stages.\n\n- Simple, hollow organs such as bladders and tracheas have been successfully transplanted into humans, but these are not considered complex vital organs.\n- For more complex organs like the liver, heart, and lungs, researchers have made progress in animal models. For example, liver grafts have been grown and transplanted into rats, and rat hearts and lungs have been engineered to function temporarily after transplantation.\n- However, these experiments are primarily in small animal models (like rats and mice) rather than large animal models, and the long-term functionality and integration of these organs are still being studied and improved.\n\nWhile there are promising developments, such as the use of iPSCs and decellularization techniques, the transition to large animal models and subsequently to human trials is still a subject of ongoing research and not yet realized.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as the sources do not provide clear evidence of successful transplantation of complex vital organs into large animal models that indicate a near-term potential for human trials.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant technical barriers remaining that make the transplantation of lab-grown complex vital organs into humans before 2025 unlikely?\nANSWER: Yes, there are significant technical barriers that make the transplantation of lab-grown complex vital organs into humans before 2025 unlikely.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the ongoing challenges and complexities in this field:\n\n1. **Adhesion and Integration**: The study from UT Southwestern Medical Center discusses the hurdle of interspecies adhesion incompatibility, which is a major barrier to growing human organs in animals. While they have made progress, several more barriers need to be overcome.\n\n2. **Architectural and Nutritional Challenges**: The article from Fierce Biotech mentions that organizing cells in the right way to form functional 3D structures is a significant challenge. It notes that cells need to be organized in a way that allows them to receive nutrients, and current technologies are far from achieving this on a large scale.\n\n3. **Complexity of Biological Environment**: The World Economic Forum article emphasizes the complexity of matching the biological environment of various organs. It highlights the need for advancements in bioprinting technologies to recreate patient-specific complex multi-tissue structures.\n\n4. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**: The same World Economic Forum article and others mention the need for regulatory frameworks, ethical considerations, and multistakeholder collaboration to integrate bioprinted tissue solutions into clinical practice.\n\n5. **Timeline for Bioengineering**: The Mayo Clinic's Transforming Transplant Initiative estimates a research timeline of 10-15 years to potentially bring bioengineered organs to patients, indicating that significant technical and regulatory hurdles need to be addressed before such organs can be transplanted into humans.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that while progress is being made, the technical, biological, and regulatory barriers are substantial enough to make the transplantation of lab-grown complex vital organs into humans before 2025 unlikely.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\nAs of November 4, 2024, there are approximately 58 days remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf nothing changed between now and the deadline, the outcome would be **NO**; lab-grown complex vital organs would not have been used successfully in humans before 2025.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith approximately 15 days left, the probability of a successful transplantation occurring before the deadline would be even lower than it is now.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nWith about 232 days remaining (extending the deadline to around July 2025), the probability would increase slightly but would still remain low due to ongoing technical and regulatory challenges.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the current state of research and development in organ bioengineering, it is highly unlikely that lab-grown complex vital organs will be used successfully in humans before January 1, 2025. As of October 2023, there have been no reported cases of successful transplantation of lab-grown hearts, livers, kidneys, or lungs into humans. Significant technical barriers remain, such as replicating the complex structures and functions of these organs, establishing robust vascularization to supply nutrients throughout the organ, and ensuring long-term viability and integration within the human body.\n\nNo regulatory bodies have approved clinical trials for such transplantations to be conducted before the deadline, and there are no announcements of imminent plans by companies or research groups to perform them. The process of moving from preclinical studies to human trials involves extensive testing, regulatory approvals, and ethical considerations, all of which require substantial time.\n\nEven with an extension of time, such as doubling or quadrupling the remaining period, the probability would remain low due to the pace of technological advancement and the procedural timelines necessary for clinical implementation. Experts in the field often project that functional lab-grown complex organs may become viable for human transplantation within the next decade or more, not within the imminent few months.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 1%**",
