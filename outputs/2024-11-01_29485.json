    "prompt": "QUESTION:\n[Short fuse] Will California's Proposition 33 (allowing rent control) pass in the 2024 general election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if California Proposition 33 passes in the state's 2024 general election, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the ballot measure passes. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nProposition 33 ([Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_33,_Prohibit_State_Limitations_on_Local_Rent_Control_Initiative_(2024))) will appear on the state-wide ballot in California for the US General Election on Tuesday, November 5, 2024. It will pass if a simple majority who vote on the measure approve it. Since this question will be decided by popular vote, this question essentially asks whether sentiment in California had shifted since the post-Covid housing crisis on whether voters would be inclined to favor rent control. This might be a bellwether on popular attitudes on the housing crisis and progressive sentiment in the United States where people demand the government to take proactive measures to address certain social problems. \r\n\r\nProposition 33 would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995, which prevents local governments from enacting rent control on homes built after 1995 or if the tenants move out. Essentially, Proposition 33 will empower local governments to have more available courses of action to reduce rents. Governor Gavin Newsom passed a law in 2019 that capped rent increase in California to 5 percent plus the rate of inflation or a maximum of 10 percent. However, proponents of Proposition 33 argue that this is insufficient.  \r\n\r\nGenerally, tenant advocates support Proposition 33, while landlord interest groups are bankrolling the campaign against it. \r\n\r\nThe conventional wisdom among economists is that rent control will lower the supply of housing since it reduces the profit incentive for developers to produce more housing.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, Proposition 21 was on the ballot, which would authorize cities to enact rent control ordinances. The Proposition only received 40.1 percent approval out of the votes of voted on the proposition. \r\n\r\nSources:\r\nhttps://calmatters.org/housing/2024/10/prop-33-2024-fact-check/\r\nhttps://calmatters.org/election-2020-guide/proposition-21-rent-control/\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of California's Proposition 33 passing in the 2024 general election, here are some key points and contextual information that could inform a prediction:\n\n## Historical Context\n- California voters have previously rejected similar measures aimed at repealing the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act of 1995. For example, Proposition 10 in 2018 and Proposition 21 in 2020 were both rejected by nearly 60% of voters.\n\n## Current State of Housing in California\n- California is facing a severe housing affordability crisis, with renters typically paying about 50% more for housing than renters in other states. High rent costs are a significant issue, and many tenants are burdened by rents exceeding 30% of their income.\n\n## Proposition Details\n- Proposition 33 would repeal the Costa-Hawkins Act, allowing cities and counties to impose rent control on any type of housing, including single-family homes, condominiums, and properties built after 1995. It would also prevent the state from limiting local rent control laws in the future.\n\n## Support and Opposition\n- The proposition is supported by groups such as the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the California Democratic Party, and various tenant advocacy organizations. However, it is opposed by real estate groups, the California Chamber of Commerce, and some state lawmakers, who argue that it could deter new housing development and reduce property values.\n\n## Funding\n- The campaign for Proposition 33 is well-funded, with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation contributing over $46 million. However, the opposition has raised even more, with real estate groups contributing over $100 million to fight the measure.\n\n## Fiscal Impact\n- If passed, Proposition 33 could lead to reduced local property tax revenues due to potential decreases in property values, although this reduction is estimated to be less than one-half of 1% of all property tax revenue.\n\n## Public Sentiment\n- Given the ongoing housing crisis and the financial burdens on renters, there may be strong public sentiment in favor of measures to control rents. However, the previous rejections of similar propositions suggest that voters may remain skeptical about the effectiveness of rent control in addressing the broader housing shortage.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The historical rejection of similar propositions suggests a base rate against the passage of rent control measures. However, the current economic and housing conditions might influence voter behavior differently this time.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The outcome will be determined on November 5, 2024, during the general election.\n\nGiven these points, while it is possible to make an informed prediction, the answer to whether Proposition 33 will pass is not immediately clear. The historical context of previous rejections, the strong opposition from real estate groups, and the ongoing housing crisis all play significant roles in how voters might decide.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent polls in 2024 indicated that Proposition 33 has majority support among California voters?\nANSWER: No, recent polls in 2024 have not indicated that Proposition 33 has majority support among California voters. According to the sources, polling results show that opposition to Proposition 33 is significant, and the measure does not have majority support. For example, one poll indicated that 45% of likely voters intend to vote against it, while the support is not at a majority level.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major political figures or parties in California endorsing Proposition 33?\nANSWER: Yes, major political figures and parties in California are endorsing Proposition 33.\n\n- The California Democratic Party has endorsed Proposition 33.\n- Prominent political figures such as U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, and State Sen. Ben Allen have also endorsed the proposition.\n- Additional endorsements come from civil rights leader Dolores Huerta and other notable figures and organizations.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did similar rent control propositions, like Proposition 21 in 2020, fail to pass in California?\nANSWER: Yes, similar rent control propositions in California have failed to pass in recent years.\n\n- Proposition 10 in 2018, which aimed to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act and allow cities to enact their own rent control laws, was rejected by 59% of California voters.\n- Proposition 21 in 2020, which sought to amend the Costa-Hawkins Act to allow local governments to impose rent control on more types of housing, was also rejected by 59.9% of California voters.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the opposition to Proposition 33 receiving more funding than the support campaign?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the funding for the opposition to Proposition 33 appears to be greater than the funding for the support campaign.\n\n- The support campaign, primarily funded by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, has contributed more than $36 million, and there are additional contributions from other supporters such as labor and tenant organizations, including a $600,000 contribution from Los Angeles City Councilmember Kevin de Le√≥n.\n- The opposition, however, has received significant funding from various sources, including $34.4 million from the California Apartment Assn., $1.9 million from investor Michael K. Hayde, and $22 million from the California Assn. of Realtors. These contributions total more than the support campaign's funding.\n\nTherefore, the opposition to Proposition 33 is receiving more funding than the support campaign.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has public opinion in California shifted significantly in favor of rent control measures since 2020?\nANSWER: Public opinion in California on rent control measures has not shifted significantly in favor of such measures since 2020, based on the available information.\n\n- In 2018 and 2020, similar measures to repeal the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act were voted down by about 60% of the voting population.\n- As of the latest polls in 2024, support for Proposition 33, which aims to repeal Costa-Hawkins and allow local governments to enact rent control, is still divided. A poll showed that only 37% of voters support the measure, while 33% oppose it, and nearly a third are undecided.\n\nThis indicates that while there is some support for rent control, it is not a clear majority, and public opinion remains mixed on the issue. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that public opinion has shifted significantly in favor of rent control measures since 2020.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout among young and low-income voters expected to be higher in the 2024 general election in California?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the expectation for voter turnout among young and low-income voters in the 2024 general election in California is not positive.\n\nFor young voters:\n- The CIRCLE analysis indicates that most states, including California, have fewer young people registered to vote as of September 2024 compared to the 2020 election. This suggests a potential decrease in youth voter registration and, by extension, possibly lower turnout.\n- The Daily Bruin article highlights a sense of disillusionment and nihilism among young voters, which could further reduce their motivation to vote.\n\nFor low-income voters:\n- The Public Policy Institute of California report shows that likely voters in California tend to be more affluent, with 58% having annual household incomes of $80,000 or more. This implies that lower-income individuals might be less represented among likely voters, suggesting potentially lower turnout among this demographic.\n\nGiven these points, the evidence suggests that voter turnout among young and low-income voters is not expected to be higher in the 2024 general election in California.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have influential housing advocacy groups in California increased their support for rent control measures in recent years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that influential housing advocacy groups in California have indeed increased their support for rent control measures in recent years.\n\n- The ACCE Action, a prominent advocacy group, has been actively lobbying and organizing to pass stronger tenant protection laws, including rent control measures. They have supported initiatives like the Homelessness Prevention Act and local rent control ordinances, indicating a strong commitment to expanding rent control.\n\n- The \"Yes on 33\" campaign, supported by pro-renter, social justice, veterans, and senior groups, aims to eliminate the statewide ban on rent control and allow local governments to expand rent control. This campaign reflects increased advocacy for rent control measures.\n\n- Housing California, another key advocacy group, focuses on shaping policy to end homelessness and create affordable homes, which includes advocating for rent control as a way to address housing affordability and homelessness.\n\nThese sources demonstrate that influential housing advocacy groups in California have been actively promoting and supporting rent control measures in recent years. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent successful rent control implementations in California cities that could influence voter opinion?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent and ongoing efforts in California cities to implement or expand rent control, which could influence voter opinion.\n\nSeveral cities in California have already implemented or are in the process of introducing new rent control measures. For example:\n- Cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, Berkeley, Oakland, and West Hollywood have longstanding rent control laws, but they are constrained by the Costa-Hawkins Act. However, these cities are preparing to expand their rent control policies if Proposition 33 passes.\n- Other cities such as Larkspur, Pittsburg, San Pablo, and Redwood City in the Bay Area have introduced their own rent control reforms to limit annual rent increases and prohibit \"renovictions\".\n- Cities like Santa Ana and the unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County have recently passed rent control ordinances that limit annual rent increases.\n\nThese local initiatives and the ongoing debate around Proposition 33, which aims to repeal parts of the Costa-Hawkins Act, indicate active efforts to address housing affordability and could influence voter opinion on the issue of rent control.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the California housing crisis significantly worse in 2024 compared to 2020?\nANSWER: The California housing crisis appears to be persistently severe and has not improved significantly since 2020; in some aspects, it has worsened. Here are the key points:\n\n- The housing shortage in California has been ongoing since about 1970, and by 2024, the state still faces a significant shortage, with estimates suggesting a need for 3.5 million additional homes to meet demand by 2025.\n- Median home prices in California have continued to rise, exceeding $800,000 in 2024, which is more than double the national average. This is a continuation of the high prices seen in previous years.\n- The rental market remains challenging, with median rents for a two-bedroom apartment exceeding $3,000 monthly in many urban areas, and a significant portion of renters facing high-cost burdens.\n- The housing affordability crisis has reached a 16-year low in 2023, and this trend continues into 2024, with only about 16% of homebuyers able to purchase a median-priced single-family home.\n- High mortgage rates and low housing inventory continue to hamper home sales, with sales levels remaining very low compared to previous years, similar to the lows seen in 2022 and 2023.\n\nGiven these points, the housing crisis in California is not only persistent but also continues to pose significant challenges, indicating that the situation is not better and may be worse in some respects compared to 2020.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are California voters more concerned about housing affordability in 2024 than they were in previous elections?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it is clear that housing affordability has become a significantly more prominent issue in the 2024 elections in California.\n\n1. **Increased Public Discourse**: The sources indicate that housing affordability and homelessness are now dominant topics in public discourse, court dockets, and everyday conversations, which was not as emphasized in previous years.\n\n2. **Federal and State Political Involvement**: Housing has entered the federal political landscape more prominently, with both presidential and congressional races addressing the issue, particularly in California. This is a new development, as historically, the federal government has not been as involved in housing legislation.\n\n3. **Voter Concerns**: There is a strong indication that voters at all levels are now more vocal about their housing concerns, with many expressing a desire for action to lower housing prices. This level of voter concern is highlighted as a critical factor in the current elections.\n\n4. **Specific Ballot Measures**: The presence of Proposition 5 on the ballot, which aims to address affordable housing by lowering the approval threshold for local bonds, further underscores the heightened focus on housing affordability in the 2024 elections.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that California voters are indeed more concerned about housing affordability in 2024 than they were in previous elections.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n- 4 days (the general election is on November 5, 2024).\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n- If current trends and polling remain the same, Proposition 33 is likely to **not pass**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n- With only 1 day left until the election, the likelihood of Proposition 33 passing would be slightly lower due to limited time for any significant shifts in public opinion or campaigning. The forecast would remain that it is **unlikely to pass**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n- If there were 16 days left until the election, there would be more opportunity for advocacy groups to influence voters, but historical trends suggest that a significant change in outcome is still **unlikely**. The forecast would lean towards Proposition 33 **not passing**, but with slightly increased uncertainty.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Precedent:**\n  - Similar propositions (Proposition 10 in 2018 and Proposition 21 in 2020) failed to pass, each receiving approximately 40% of the vote. This suggests a base rate against the passage of statewide rent control measures.\n\n- **Current Polling Data:**\n  - Recent polls in 2024 do not indicate majority support for Proposition 33. One poll showed 45% of likely voters intend to vote against it, with support not reaching a majority.\n\n- **Support and Opposition Dynamics:**\n  - While Proposition 33 has endorsements from major political figures and the California Democratic Party, the opposition is receiving more funding, notably from real estate groups and associations.\n  - The funding disparity favors the opposition, which can significantly impact advertising and voter outreach in the final days before the election.\n\n- **Public Sentiment and Awareness:**\n  - Although housing affordability is a significant concern for California voters in 2024, this has not necessarily translated into increased support for rent control measures.\n  - Public opinion has not shifted significantly in favor of rent control since the previous propositions were rejected.\n  - Many voters may be skeptical of rent control as an effective solution to the housing crisis due to concerns about its potential impact on housing supply and development.\n\n- **Demographic Factors:**\n  - Voter turnout among young and low-income voters, who are more likely to support rent control, is not expected to be higher in this election.\n  - The lower registration and potential turnout among these demographics could negatively affect the chances of Proposition 33 passing.\n\n- **Recent Developments:**\n  - Some cities have implemented local rent control measures, which could influence voter opinion positively toward Proposition 33.\n  - Influential housing advocacy groups have increased their support for rent control, potentially raising awareness.\n\n- **Economic Considerations:**\n  - The economic implications of repealing the Costa-Hawkins Act may concern voters, particularly the potential negative effects on housing supply and property values.\n  - The strong opposition campaign may amplify these concerns through advertising and messaging.\n\n- **Time Factor:**\n  - With only four days left until the election, it is challenging for the support campaign to significantly shift voter opinion, especially given the funding disadvantage.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
