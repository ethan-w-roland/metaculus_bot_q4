    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the USDA-posted recall affecting Dearborn Sausage Company, Inc be closed before December 1, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-18\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of Dearborn Sausage Company's ready-to-eat (RTE) wiener products due to misbranding and undeclared allergens is changed from Active to Closed when [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/dearborn-sausage-company-inc--recalls-wiener-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) is accessed by Metaculus after November 30, 2024. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Dayton Daily News on [September 12, 2024](https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/beef-pork-wiener-label-mix-up-leads-to-recall-undeclared-allergen/OU4NXTZP7VGX5KFQD64OPADGFE/), About 1,944 pounds of ready-to-eat wieners have been recalled by the Dearborn Sausage Company Inc. because beef products were labeled as pork and vice versa. The swap also led to soy, a known allergen, not being declared on the beef wieners. The problem was discovered when the establishment received a complaint from a retailer that the products they received may have been incorrectly labeled. The establishment determined that they inadvertently mislabeled beef wiener products as beef and pork wiener products and vice versa. The products labeled as beef and pork wiener products actually contain beef wiener products that contain soy; therefore, soy is not declared on the finished product label. Additionally, the product labeled as beef wiener products actually contain beef and pork wiener products, therefore, pork is not declared on the finished product label. There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the USDA-posted recall affecting Dearborn Sausage Company, Inc. will be closed before December 1, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Recall Details\n- The recall was announced on September 12, 2024, due to misbranding and undeclared allergens (soy and pork) in ready-to-eat (RTE) wiener products[2][5].\n- The products in question were produced on August 7, 2024, and were shipped to retail locations in Ohio[5].\n\n## Current Status\n- As of the latest information available, there are no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to the consumption of these products. However, consumers are advised not to consume the products and to either throw them away or return them to the place of purchase[5].\n\n## Closure of Recalls\n- The closure of a recall typically depends on several factors, including the completion of the product retrieval process, verification that all affected products have been removed from the market, and confirmation that no further risks are posed to consumers.\n- There is no specific timeline provided in the sources for when the recall is expected to be closed.\n\n## Base Rates and Time to Resolution\n- The time it takes to resolve a recall can vary widely depending on the complexity of the issue, the extent of the distribution, and the efficiency of the recall process. Some recalls may be resolved quickly if the affected products are easily identifiable and limited in distribution, while others may take longer.\n\nGiven the information available, it is not possible to definitively state whether the recall will be closed before December 1, 2024. The resolution of the recall depends on various factors, including the speed and effectiveness of the product retrieval and the verification process by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Therefore, the answer to this question is not immediately clear.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any adverse reactions been reported related to the recalled Dearborn Sausage Company products since the recall announcement?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThere have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to the consumption of the recalled Dearborn Sausage Company products, as stated in multiple sources[3][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the USDA's FSIS recently closed other recalls that were initiated around the same time as the Dearborn Sausage Company recall?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information about other recalls initiated around the same time as the Dearborn Sausage Company recall. The sources only detail the specific recall by Dearborn Sausage Company and do not mention other recalls.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Dearborn Sausage Company, Inc. issued any recent statements indicating they have completed all actions required for the recall?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Dearborn Sausage Company, Inc. has issued any recent statements confirming that they have completed all actions required for the recall. The sources detail the recall itself, the reasons for it, and the actions consumers should take, but they do not mention the completion of the recall process by the company.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any updates from the USDA's FSIS regarding the status of the Dearborn Sausage Company recall since its initiation?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of updates from the USDA's FSIS regarding the status of the Dearborn Sausage Company recall since its initiation on September 12, 2024. The sources detail the initial recall announcement and the reasons for the recall, but they do not provide any subsequent updates on the recall's status.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any indication from official sources that the Dearborn Sausage Company recall will remain active beyond December 1, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the Dearborn Sausage Company recall will remain active beyond December 1, 2024. The sources mention the recall details, the production dates, and the sell-by dates (November 5, 2024), but they do not specify anything about the recall status beyond these dates[3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the relatively small quantity of product involved (approximately 1,944 pounds) suggest a quicker resolution is likely?\nANSWER: The quantity of the product involved does not directly influence the time to resolution (TTR) or average resolution time (ART) in the context of customer support. These metrics are more closely related to the efficiency of the support processes, the training and resources of the support team, and the complexity of the issues being resolved, rather than the quantity of the product[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the relatively small quantity of product involved (approximately 1,944 pounds) does not necessarily suggest a quicker resolution is likely. The resolution time is determined by other factors such as the support team's efficiency, the complexity of the issue, and the support processes in place.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the recall affecting Dearborn Sausage Company, Inc. still listed as active on the USDA's FSIS website as of today?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, the recall of Dearborn Sausage Company, Inc.'s wiener products due to misbranding and undeclared allergens was announced on September 12, 2024. However, none of the sources explicitly state whether the recall is still listed as active on the USDA's FSIS website as of the current date (November 19, 2024).\n\nTo determine if the recall is still active, one would need to check the current status on the USDA's FSIS website directly, which the provided sources do not update in real-time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recalls due to misbranding and undeclared allergens typically been resolved within this timeframe historically?\nANSWER: The resolution time for food recalls, including those due to misbranding and undeclared allergens, can vary significantly and is not consistently within a specific timeframe.\n\nHistorically, recalls have often been delayed due to various factors. For instance, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) has criticized the FDA for not having an effective process to ensure prompt recalls. In some cases, significant delays have been observed, such as 165 days between the identification of a potentially adulterated product and the announcement of the recall[1][5].\n\nWhile the FDA expects companies to issue a press release within 24 hours of deciding to conduct a recall and to quickly remove and dispose of recalled food, the overall process of identifying the issue, investigating, and completing the recall can take much longer. This is especially true for issues that do not create an immediate public health threat, where companies may be given more time to resolve the issue[2][3].\n\nTherefore, it is unclear whether recalls due to misbranding and undeclared allergens have typically been resolved within a specific, short timeframe historically.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the USDA's FSIS closed any recalls of similar size and nature within two and a half months in the past?\nANSWER: To determine if the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has closed any recalls of similar size and nature within two and a half months in the past, we need to examine the recent recall data provided by the sources.\n\n1. **BrucePac Recall**: The most recent significant recall mentioned is by BrucePac, where approximately 11,765,285 pounds of ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products were recalled due to possible contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. This recall was announced on October 9, 2024, and the products were produced from May 31, 2024, to October 8, 2024[4].\n\n2. **Recall Closure**: The sources provided do not explicitly state the closure dates of recent recalls. However, they do detail ongoing recall activities and updates, indicating that the process of identifying and recalling products is often ongoing and can take several months.\n\nGiven the information available, there is no clear indication that a recall of similar size and nature (involving millions of pounds of RTE meat and poultry products) has been closed within two and a half months in the past. The sources focus more on the announcement and ongoing management of recalls rather than their closure.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any reported complications or compliance issues that could delay the closure of the recall?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several reported complications and compliance issues that can delay the closure of a medical device recall.\n\n## Delay in Notification and Action\nMedical device recalls often suffer from delays in notification, which can take weeks or even months for hospitals and patients to learn about the recall. This delay is partly due to the reliance on paper communications and mail services, as well as limited use of device-specific identifiers and a lack of data reporting standardization[3].\n\n## Tracking and Identifying Devices\nIdentifying and tracking down 100% of the recalled devices can be challenging and time-consuming. Manufacturers face difficulties because providers can be unresponsive to recall notices, and some may refuse to return or stop using the recalled devices[3].\n\n## Effectiveness Checks\nThe process of conducting effectiveness checks to verify that all consignees have received notification and taken appropriate action can be complex and time-consuming. This involves multiple methods such as personal visits, telephone calls, and letters, which can add to the overall duration of the recall process[2].\n\n## Lack of Standardization\nThe recall process lacks uniformity, with crucial steps varying by the company issuing the recall, the hospital addressing the recall, or the specific product involved. This variability can lead to confusion and delays[3].\n\n## Continued Use Despite Recalls\nIn some cases, recalled medical devices may continue to be used because there are no immediate alternatives or because the issues can be remedied with on-site corrections. This can prolong the recall process as the FDA and manufacturers work to ensure patient safety while the devices remain in use[5].\n\n## Multiple Recalls for the Same Product\nSome products undergo multiple recalls without being removed from the market, which can complicate the process and delay full resolution. For example, the MitraClip line has been subject to multiple recalls, each addressing different issues[5].\n\nThese factors collectively contribute to the complexity and potential delays in closing a medical device recall.",
    "comment": "(a) There are 12 days left until December 1, 2024, when the outcome of the question will be known.\n\n(b) If nothing changed and the recall remained active, the outcome would be **No**—the recall would not be closed before December 1, 2024.\n\n(c) If there were only a quarter of the time left (3 days), I would forecast a lower probability of the recall being closed before December 1, perhaps around **5%**.\n\n(d) If there were 4 times the time left (48 days), I would forecast a higher probability of the recall being closed before December 1, perhaps around **40%**.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe recall was initiated on September 12, 2024, due to misbranding and undeclared allergens in approximately 1,944 pounds of ready-to-eat wiener products from Dearborn Sausage Company, Inc. The products had a sell-by date of November 5, 2024. As of now, there have been no reported adverse reactions, and the mislabeling issue seems limited in scope.\n\nTypically, the closure of a recall by the USDA's FSIS depends on several factors:\n\n- Confirmation that all affected products have been removed from commerce.\n- Verification that corrective actions have been implemented to prevent future occurrences.\n- Time needed for the agency to process and update the recall status.\n\nGiven that the sell-by date has passed and the products are likely no longer in circulation, there's a possibility that the recall could be closed soon. However, as of today's date, there is no public information indicating that the recall has been closed.\n\nWith only 12 days remaining until December 1, 2024, and no updates suggesting an imminent closure, the probability is relatively low. Historical data on similar recalls shows that closures can take varying amounts of time, often longer than the time we have left.\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
