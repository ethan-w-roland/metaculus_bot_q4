    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore December 31, 2024, will Tech Crunch report new layoffs at Tesla?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-20\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to Tech Crunch's tracker \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs,\" which can be accessed [here](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/tech-layoffs-2024-list/), Tesla has layoffs following the launch of this question and before December 31, 2024. To resolve the question, a Metaculus Admin will go to the Tech Crunch link on December 31, 2024, and see if Tesla appears for November 2024 or December 2024. If Tesla is not listed as having a layoff event under those months, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nFor ease of resolution, in this series of questions, in order to count the Tech Crunch page must specifically list the company in question. This is true regardless of subsidiaries or ownerships. So for example, a question on Microsoft must specifically mention Microsoft, and a layoff event at LinkedIn will not count for purposes of this question (unless the subheading mentions Microsoft), even though LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft.\n\nAccording to Tech Crunch, \"Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2024, to be updated regularly.\" Admins to resolve this question will only be looking to see what is on the page at the time of resolution. If Tech Crunch ceases to publish updates on the resolution source following the launch of this question (regardless of what can be found elsewhere on the Tech Crunch website), this question resolves as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTesla is most recently listed in April 2024, with the blurb saying, \"Has gutted its charging team in a new round of layoffs, CEO Elon Musk announced in an overnight email to executives.\" \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of TechCrunch reporting new layoffs at Tesla before December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Recent Layoffs\nTesla has already conducted significant layoffs in 2024. In April 2024, Tesla announced layoffs affecting at least 10% of its global workforce, which translates to around 14,000 employees, following a year-over-year delivery decline[2][5].\n\n## Current Trends\nThe tech industry is experiencing a wave of layoffs in 2024, with many companies, including major tech firms, reducing their workforce due to various factors such as economic conditions, restructuring for AI initiatives, and cost savings[2][3][4].\n\n## Leadership and Structural Changes\nTesla has seen recent executive departures and structural changes, which could indicate ongoing adjustments within the company. However, there is no current indication of additional large-scale layoffs planned or announced by Tesla[5].\n\n## Reporting Patterns\nTechCrunch and other tech news outlets have been actively tracking and reporting layoffs across the tech industry. If Tesla were to announce new layoffs, it is likely that TechCrunch would report on this given their comprehensive coverage of tech layoffs in 2024[3].\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile there is no concrete evidence to suggest that Tesla will announce new layoffs before December 31, 2024, the ongoing trends in the tech industry and the recent history of layoffs at Tesla make it plausible. However, without specific information or announcements from Tesla, it is not possible to definitively predict whether new layoffs will be reported by TechCrunch.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- **Base Rate**: The tech industry has seen a high rate of layoffs in 2024, affecting over 130,000 jobs across 457 companies[3].\n- **Reference Class**: Major tech companies, including Tesla, have already made significant workforce reductions in 2024, indicating a pattern of cost-cutting and restructuring measures.\n\nGiven these points, while the question cannot be answered with a definitive \"yes\" or \"no\" based on current information, the context suggests that it is within the realm of possibility.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has TechCrunch continued to update its \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" regularly since April 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nTechCrunch has continued to update its comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs regularly. The sources indicate updates as recent as November 14, 2024, with new layoff announcements and details included in the list[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Tesla's stock price declining as of November 2024?\nANSWER: No, as of November 2024, Tesla's stock price is not declining; it is actually increasing. The recent surge in Tesla's stock price is attributed to the re-election of Donald Trump and the perceived benefits to Tesla from his policies, such as potential lighter regulation and support for autonomous driving initiatives[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has TechCrunch reported on any internal restructuring at Tesla in the past two months?\nANSWER: YES, TechCrunch has reported on internal restructuring at Tesla in the past two months. The reports mention that Tesla informed employees that more than 10% of its global workforce, approximately 14,000 workers, would be laid off as part of a company-wide restructuring. This restructuring was announced to reduce costs and increase productivity, and it affected employees across all departments and seniority levels[2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Tesla announced any plans for additional layoffs after April 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit confirmation of Tesla announcing plans for additional layoffs after the April 2024 layoffs.\n\n- The sources confirm that Tesla did announce a 10% layoff in April 2024, but they do not mention any plans for further layoffs beyond that point[4][5].\n- Therefore, the answer to whether Tesla has announced plans for additional layoffs after April 2024 is UNCLEAR, as the sources do not provide this specific information.\n\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent executive departures at Tesla since April 2024?\nANSWER: YES, there have been several recent executive departures at Tesla since April 2024.\n\n- In April, executives such as Drew Baglino, Rebecca Tinucci, and Rohan Patel left the company amid significant layoffs[1][3][5].\n- In the months following, additional executives departed, including Sreela Venkataratnam in August, Rich Otto in May, and more recently, Nagesh Saldi, Jos Dings, Marc Van Impe, David Zhang, and Daniel Ho, with some of these departures occurring just before the Robotaxi event in October[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there rumors or insider reports suggesting upcoming layoffs at Tesla?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThere have been several reports and insider information suggesting upcoming layoffs at Tesla. Here are some key points:\n\n- In May 2024, it was reported that the rolling job cuts at Tesla are likely to extend through at least June, according to people familiar with the matter[1].\n- There have been multiple waves of layoffs, with the most recent ones affecting the company's software, service, and engineering departments[2].\n- In April 2024, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced plans to cut more than 10% of the company's workforce, and there were indications that further cuts would be made outside North America[5].\n- Rumors of potential layoffs had been circulating among Tesla employees since late February 2024, with managers asked to identify business-critical roles and temporarily delay performance reviews[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any official communications from Tesla’s CEO regarding workforce changes post-April 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the official communications from Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, regarding workforce changes were made in April 2024, not post-April 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- In April 2024, Elon Musk announced in an email to staff that Tesla would be laying off more than 10% of its global workforce due to various reasons including job overlap and the need for cost savings[2][4][5].\n\nThere is no mention of any official communications from Elon Musk regarding workforce changes that occurred after April 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the overall tech industry expected to continue layoffs through the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is clear that the tech industry has been experiencing significant layoffs throughout 2024 and there are indications that this trend is likely to continue through the end of the year.\n\n- Multiple sources report ongoing layoffs in various tech companies, with no indication of a slowdown. For example, companies like Cisco, Dell, and Qualcomm have announced layoffs that will extend into the latter part of 2024[1][2][5].\n- The second half of 2024 has seen continued layoffs, with over 100,000 IT jobs cut across several companies, and this trend is expected to persist as part of their restructuring plans[2].\n- Specific layoff announcements, such as those from Intel, SAP, and Tesla, also suggest that these job cuts are part of broader restructuring strategies that will continue through the year[2][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that the overall tech industry is expected to continue layoffs through the end of 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Tesla experienced a significant year-over-year decline in deliveries since April 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Tesla has experienced a significant year-over-year decline in deliveries since April 2024.\n\n- In the first quarter of 2024, Tesla delivered approximately 386,810 vehicles, which is a decline from the 422,875 vehicles delivered in Q1 2023, representing a year-over-year drop[2][3].\n- The decline is further emphasized by a 9% decrease in global electric vehicle deliveries during the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023[1].\n- Additionally, forecasts suggest that this decline may continue, with potential negative growth in the subsequent quarters, contributing to an overall expected decline in annual deliveries for 2024[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major cost-cutting measures announced by Tesla in recent press releases?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several major cost-cutting measures announced by Tesla in recent press releases:\n\n1. **Price Cuts**: Tesla has implemented significant price reductions for several of its models in the U.S., China, and Germany to boost sales and maintain market dominance amidst increasing competition[4].\n\n2. **Simplification of Vehicle Design**: Tesla is focusing on simplifying vehicle design to reduce costs. This includes eliminating parts and adopting a minimalist approach, as illustrated by the Cybertruck's design[2].\n\n3. **Abandonment of Gigacasting**: Tesla has abandoned its plan to advance gigacasting, a groundbreaking production process, in favor of more conventional and cost-effective methods[3].\n\n4. **Unboxed Manufacturing Process**: Tesla is introducing a new \"unboxed\" manufacturing system that aims to slash production costs in half by assembling parts simultaneously in dedicated areas rather than using a traditional linear production line[5].\n\n5. **Workforce Reduction**: The company has conducted a major downsizing, resulting in the dismissal of over 10% of its global workforce, to cut costs further[4].\n\n6. **Focus on Efficiency and Simplicity**: Elon Musk has emphasized the importance of cutting costs by finding ways to save on each of the roughly 10,000 components of a vehicle, likening the process to a financial \"Game of Thrones\"[2].",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until outcome is known:** 41 days (from November 20, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) Outcome if nothing changes:** **No** — If no new layoffs are announced by Tesla before December 31, 2024, TechCrunch will not report new layoffs.\n\n**(c) Forecast with only a quarter of the time left (approximately 10 days):** 10%\n\n**(d) Forecast with 4x the time left (approximately 164 days):** 60%\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAssessing the probability that TechCrunch will report new layoffs at Tesla before December 31, 2024, involves analyzing several factors:\n\n1. **Current State of Tesla:**\n   - **Recent Layoffs:** Tesla conducted significant layoffs in April 2024, reducing over 10% of its global workforce. This indicates a precedent for workforce reductions.\n   - **Executive Departures:** Multiple executive departures since April suggest organizational restructuring, which could precede further layoffs.\n   - **Cost-Cutting Measures:** Tesla has implemented various cost-cutting strategies, including price reductions, simplification of vehicle design, abandonment of certain manufacturing processes, and workforce reductions. These measures often correlate with attempts to streamline operations, which can lead to additional layoffs.\n\n2. **Tech Industry Trends:**\n   - **Ongoing Layoffs:** The tech industry has been experiencing continuous layoffs in 2024, with over 130,000 jobs cut across 457 companies. This industry-wide trend increases the likelihood of Tesla following suit.\n   - **Base Rate:** Given that major tech companies are reducing their workforce due to economic conditions, restructuring for AI initiatives, and cost savings, Tesla is part of a broader pattern.\n\n3. **Reporting Patterns:**\n   - **TechCrunch's Coverage:** TechCrunch has been actively updating its list of 2024 tech layoffs, including Tesla's layoffs in April. Their comprehensive coverage suggests that any new layoffs at Tesla would likely be reported.\n   - **Regular Updates:** Since TechCrunch has been consistently updating its layoff tracker, the likelihood of them reporting additional layoffs is high if Tesla makes such announcements.\n\n4. **Subquestions Insights:**\n   - **Rumors and Insider Reports:** There are rumors and insider reports suggesting upcoming layoffs at Tesla, which increase the probability of new layoffs.\n   - **No Official Announcements Post-April:** While there have been no official communications from Elon Musk regarding layoffs after April 2024, the internal indicators (executive departures, ongoing cost-cutting) suggest potential for future layoffs.\n\n5. **Time Frame Impact:**\n   - **Short Time Frame (41 days):** With approximately 1.5 months left, the window for a new layoff announcement exists but is relatively short. Given the current indicators, a moderate probability is reasonable.\n   - **Shorter Time Frame (10 days):** With only about 10 days left, the probability decreases as there is less time for new announcements unless they are imminent.\n   - **Extended Time Frame (164 days):** Extending the time frame to about 5 months increases the likelihood, allowing more time for Tesla to announce further layoffs in response to ongoing economic pressures and internal restructuring.\n\n6. **Stock Performance:**\n   - **Stable or Increasing Stock Price:** As of November 2024, Tesla's stock price is not declining, which might suggest better financial health. However, stock performance does not always accurately reflect internal workforce changes.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\nConsidering Tesla's recent layoffs, ongoing executive departures, cost-cutting measures, industry-wide layoff trends, and TechCrunch's active reporting, there is a plausible probability that new layoffs might occur before the end of the year. However, given the lack of official announcements post-April and the relatively short time frame, the probability is moderate.\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
