    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore December 31, 2024, will Tech Crunch report new layoffs at Netflix?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-12\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to Tech Crunch's tracker \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs,\" which can be accessed [here](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/11/tech-layoffs-2024-list/), Netflix has layoffs following the launch of this question and before December 31, 2024. To resolve the question, a Metaculus Admin will go to the Tech Crunch link on December 31, 2024, and see if Netflix appears for October 2024, November 2024, or December 2024. If Netflix is not listed as having a layoff event under those months, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nTech Crunch's \"comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" will be the sole source used for resolution of this question, regardless of information from other sources. If a layoff event appears in the time period listed, this question resolves as Yes, and if not, it resolves as No. \n\nAccording to Tech Crunch, \"Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2024, to be updated regularly.\" Admins to resolve this question will only be looking to see what is on the page at the time of resolution. If Tech Crunch ceases to publish updates on the resolution source following the launch of this question (regardless of what can be found elsewhere on the Tech Crunch website), this question resolves as **No**. \"\n\nFor ease of resolution, in this series of questions, in order to count the Tech Crunch page must specifically list the company in question, which in this case is Netflix. This is true regardless of subsidiaries or ownerships. So for example, a question on Microsoft must specifically mention Microsoft, and a layoff event at LinkedIn will not count for purposes of this question (unless the subheading mentions Microsoft), even though LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAt the launch of this question, Tech Crunch did not have Netflix listed on its tracker as having had any material layoffs in 2024. In recent years Netflix has had sporadic layoffs, generally numbered in the hundreds, such as in 2023 and 2022\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of TechCrunch reporting new layoffs at Netflix before December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points and context:\n\n## Historical Layoffs\n- Many major tech companies, including Netflix, have conducted significant layoffs in 2022 and 2023. For example, in 2023, companies like Twitter, Tesla, Shopify, Microsoft, and Netflix themselves cut staff, some multiple times[1][3][5].\n\n## Current Layoff Trends\n- The tech industry is still experiencing a wave of layoffs in 2024, with over 130,000 job cuts across 457 companies as of the latest reports. This trend includes both large tech companies and smaller startups[1][3][5].\n\n## Reasons for Layoffs\n- The reasons for these layoffs include financial issues, overhiring during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the increasing adoption of AI and automation. These factors suggest that companies are continually reassessing their workforce needs[1][3].\n\n## Specific Companies\n- While the sources do not specifically mention any upcoming layoffs at Netflix as of the latest updates, the ongoing trend of layoffs across the tech industry suggests that no company is entirely immune to such actions. Companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have all made significant layoffs in 2024, indicating a broader industry trend[1][3][5].\n\n## Base Rates\n- Given the high frequency of layoffs in the tech sector in 2024, the base rate for any given tech company experiencing layoffs is relatively high.\n\n## Conclusion\nWhile there is no specific information available as of now indicating that Netflix will have new layoffs before December 31, 2024, the overall context and trends in the tech industry suggest that it is certainly possible. The question of whether TechCrunch will report new layoffs at Netflix before the end of 2024 cannot be answered definitively with the current information, but the historical and current trends make it a plausible scenario.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Netflix conducted any layoffs in 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, Netflix conducted layoffs in 2023.\n\n- In May 2023, Netflix laid off 150 executives[4].\n- In June 2023, Netflix laid off an additional 300 executives[4].\n- In September 2023, Netflix laid off about 30 more executives[4].\n\nThese layoffs were part of various restructuring efforts and were influenced by factors such as production delays due to strikes and the need to improve the company's bottom line[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has TechCrunch previously reported on layoffs at Netflix?\nANSWER: YES\n\nTechCrunch has previously reported on layoffs at Netflix. In May 2022, Netflix laid off approximately 150 primarily U.S.-based staffers due to slowing revenue growth, which was reported by TechCrunch[1][4].\n\nAdditionally, in June 2022, Netflix conducted another layoff, letting go of around 300 employees, also due to slowing growth and economic downturn, which was again reported by TechCrunch[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Netflix publicly announced plans or intentions to reduce its workforce in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Netflix has publicly announced or implemented plans to reduce its workforce in 2024.\n\n- The company has undergone several rounds of workforce reductions in 2024, including layoffs in the series and film publicity departments, the feature animation division, and the gaming division[1][5][3].\n- Specific instances include layoffs affecting 10 employees in the series and film publicity departments, a reduction of over 50 people in the feature animation division, and layoffs in the gaming division affecting under 35 employees[2][5][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Netflix implemented cost-cutting measures in 2024 other than layoffs?\nANSWER: Yes, Netflix has implemented cost-cutting measures in 2024 beyond just layoffs.\n\n- In addition to the layoffs, Netflix has shut down its AAA game development studio, Blue, and is pivoting away from interactive titles, which suggests a restructuring of their gaming strategy to reduce costs[3].\n- Netflix is also focusing on enhancing subscriber retention through its gaming strategy without introducing advertising, which is a cost-saving approach[1].\n- The company is further exploring the use of AI to create video games, which is intended to \"cut corners, ramp up productivity, and compensate for attrition after layoffs,\" indicating another cost-cutting measure[3].\n\nThese actions demonstrate that Netflix is implementing various cost-cutting measures beyond just reducing its workforce.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have other major streaming services announced layoffs in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, other major streaming services and related companies have announced layoffs in 2024.\n\n- Twitch, a streaming service owned by Amazon, laid off more than 500 employees, approximately a third of its workforce, in July 2024[3][5].\n- Paramount Global, which includes its streaming organization, announced significant layoffs, with over 2,000 employees let go as part of its cost-cutting measures[1][3].\n- Disney, particularly through its subsidiary Pixar, has also undergone layoffs as part of broader cost-cutting measures to streamline operations and focus on streaming profitability[1][3].\n\nThese layoffs reflect the industry-wide efforts to adjust to the evolving landscape and reduce costs in the face of unprofitable streaming services and declining legacy TV ad revenue.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have competitive pressures increased for Netflix due to rivals in the streaming industry in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nCompetitive pressures for Netflix have indeed increased in 2024 due to rivals in the streaming industry. Here are some key points that support this:\n\n- Netflix faces intensifying competition from other streaming giants such as Disney+, Apple TV, HBO, Amazon, Hulu, and YouTube, which are continuously offering new and original content to their subscribers[3].\n- The company's share of the streaming market has shrunk from 48% in 2019 to 26% in recent times, largely due to soaring competitive pressure[3].\n- Despite Netflix's strong Q3 2024 performance, analysts have maintained a cautious stance due to the fierce competition in the streaming space and the company's stretched valuation[4].\n- The competitive landscape remains a significant factor influencing Netflix's growth trajectory, with the company needing to adapt to market dynamics to maintain its subscriber growth[2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there industry-wide trends of layoffs in the tech sector during 2024?\nANSWER: YES, there are industry-wide trends of layoffs in the tech sector during 2024. Here are some key points that support this:\n\n- As of October 2024, 476 tech companies have laid off more than 141,467 employees, according to Layoffs.fyi[1].\n- In 2024, notable layoffs have been announced by major tech companies such as Intel, UKG, Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others[1][2][4].\n- The layoffs in 2024 are part of a broader trend that started in 2022 and 2023, with over 1,000 companies laying off a significant number of employees in 2023[2][5].\n- Factors contributing to these layoffs include economic downturn, inflation, higher interest rates, overhiring during the COVID-19 pandemic, and job corrections[1][2][5].\n\nThese sources indicate a widespread and ongoing trend of layoffs within the tech sector in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is TechCrunch actively updating its \"comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, TechCrunch is actively updating its \"comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" as of November 2024. The articles provided indicate ongoing updates and reports on new layoffs in the tech industry throughout the year, including recent layoffs in November 2024[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent reports of financial difficulties or revenue declines for Netflix?\nANSWER: No, there have not been recent reports of financial difficulties or revenue declines for Netflix. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- Netflix reported strong financial performance in the recent quarter, with revenue climbing 15% from a year ago to $9.82 billion and profit increasing by 41% to $2.36 billion[1].\n- Despite a slowdown in subscriber growth, Netflix's revenue and profit rose at a faster pace than analysts had projected[1].\n- The company predicted its revenue will continue to rise at a 15% year-over-year pace during the October-December period, which is slightly better than analysts' expectations[1].\n- Netflix's stock price surged nearly 4% in extended trading after the earnings report and has increased by more than 40% so far this year[1].\n- The decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers starting from 2025 has introduced some uncertainty, but it does not indicate current financial difficulties or revenue declines[2][3].\n\nOverall, the recent reports highlight Netflix's strong financial performance and growth, rather than financial difficulties or revenue declines.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a downturn in the global economy in 2024 affecting tech companies?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no clear indication of a significant downturn in the global economy in 2024 that specifically affects tech companies in a uniformly negative way. Here are some key points:\n\n- Global economic growth is forecasted to be modestly slower in 2024, but it is not described as a downturn. For example, global growth is expected to be 3.2% in 2024 and 3.1% in 2025, according to S&P Global[1][2].\n\n- The tech industry, while facing challenges, is expected to show signs of recovery and growth. Deloitte's 2024 technology industry outlook suggests that the tech sector could return to modest growth in 2024, driven by cloud, AI, and cybersecurity[3].\n\n- There are risks and uncertainties, including the possibility of a recession, but the probability is not high enough to confirm a downturn. J.P. Morgan estimates a 35% chance of a global recession by the end of 2024, but this is not a certainty[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately 7 weeks, or 49 days, until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf nothing changed, the outcome would be **No**, since Netflix is not currently listed on TechCrunch's layoff tracker for October or November 2024.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith about 2 weeks remaining, I would forecast a probability of **5%** that TechCrunch will report new layoffs at Netflix before December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4× the time left:**\nIf there were approximately 6 months remaining, I would forecast a probability of **25%** due to the increased time for potential layoffs to occur and be reported.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Financial Performance:** Netflix has reported strong financial results recently, with revenue and profit exceeding analysts' expectations. There are no indications of financial difficulties or revenue declines that would pressure the company to implement significant layoffs.\n\n- **Historical Layoffs:** While Netflix has conducted layoffs in previous years, including small-scale layoffs in 2024 affecting specific departments, these have not been substantial enough to be reported on TechCrunch's layoff tracker. Historically, their layoffs have been sporadic and not necessarily indicative of an imminent large-scale reduction.\n\n- **Industry Trends:** The tech industry continues to experience layoffs in 2024, but these are often tied to companies facing financial challenges or restructuring. Netflix, however, seems to be in a stable financial position compared to peers who are cutting staff.\n\n- **Time of Year:** The remaining time until December 31, 2024, coincides with the holiday season, during which companies are less likely to announce layoffs. Layoff announcements during this period can have negative publicity impacts, which companies might prefer to avoid.\n\n- **Competitive Pressures:** Although Netflix faces increased competition in the streaming market, it has been navigating these pressures through content expansion and strategic initiatives rather than cost-cutting measures like layoffs.\n\n- **Likelihood of Reporting:** For the question to resolve as \"Yes,\" layoffs must not only occur but also be reported by TechCrunch on their specific layoff tracker. Smaller layoffs or departmental restructurings may not be captured in this tracker, reducing the probability further.\n\nConsidering these factors, while it's possible that unforeseen circumstances could lead to layoffs at Netflix that are reported by TechCrunch before the end of the year, the probability is relatively low given the current information.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
