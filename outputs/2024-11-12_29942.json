    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Elon Musk or Dana White be chosen for a paid position within the Trump White House before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-12\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before January 1, 2025, Elon Musk and/or Dana White are announced as having been offered a salaried federal position within the incoming Trump Administration. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nUnpaid roles such as volunteer advisory positions will not count. Any salaried position will count, regardless of whether the person is reported to actually accept the paychecks. This question resolves based on the announcement of him being picked for a role by the incoming Administration, not beginning his duties; therefore requirements such as Senate confirmation will not affect resolution.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nCNN: [Trumpâ€™s allies are already jockeying for high-powered spots in his administration](https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/transition-donald-trump-jockeying/index.html)\n\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the available information, it is unlikely that Elon Musk will be chosen for a paid position within the Trump White House before January 1, 2025.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n- Elon Musk has been a significant supporter of Donald Trump and has been involved in various aspects of Trump's transition, including attending meetings and influencing staffing decisions. However, there is no indication that he will hold a formal, paid cabinet position due to his extensive business interests and potential conflicts of interest[3][4][5].\n\n- Musk's role is more likely to be that of an influential advisor or ally, given his access to Trump and his involvement in key discussions, but not in an official, paid capacity[1][4][5].\n\nAs for Dana White, there is no information provided in the sources regarding her potential involvement in the Trump administration or any consideration for a paid position.\n\nGiven this context, while Elon Musk's influence is significant, it does not appear to translate into a paid position within the Trump White House. Therefore, the likelihood of either Elon Musk or Dana White being chosen for a paid position before January 1, 2025, seems low, particularly for Musk based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Dana White expressed interest in serving in a federal government position?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nDana White, the CEO of the UFC, has explicitly stated that he has no personal political aspirations and does not intend to join any federal government position. He has emphasized his commitment to remaining with the UFC and has no plans to enter politics, despite his close friendship and support for Donald Trump[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently the president-elect for a term starting in 2025?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nMultiple sources confirm that Donald Trump has been elected as the president-elect for a term starting in 2025. This is stated in the YouTube video description[1], the CBS News article[2], and the NBC News article[5]. All these sources indicate that Donald Trump has won the 2024 presidential election and will begin his second term as president in January 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Elon Musk been publicly announced as being offered a salaried federal position within the Trump administration?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, Elon Musk has not been publicly announced as being offered a salaried federal position within the Trump administration, although there are discussions and suggestions about his potential role.\n\n- The sources mention that Trump floated the idea of appointing Musk to a newly created government efficiency role, but this has not been confirmed as an official offer or appointment[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Dana White been publicly announced as being offered a salaried federal position within the Trump administration?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no confirmation that Dana White has been publicly announced as being offered a salaried federal position within the Trump administration. While there are speculations and discussions about potential roles he could fill, such as a press secretary or other positions, none of the sources indicate an official announcement of him being offered a salaried federal position[2][3][5].\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Elon Musk expressed interest in serving in a federal government position?\nANSWER: Yes, Elon Musk has expressed interest in serving in a federal government position. According to the sources, Donald Trump has floated the idea of appointing Musk to a newly created government efficiency role, and Musk has indicated his willingness to serve.\n\n- Musk has been suggested for a role leading a government efficiency commission, which would give him significant influence over federal agency regulations and budget cuts[2][4][5].\n- Musk has stated on his social media platform, X, that he looks forward to serving America if the opportunity arises, emphasizing that he would do so without pay, title, or recognition[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a precedent of business leaders like Elon Musk or sports executives like Dana White being appointed to paid positions in a presidential administration?\nANSWER: There is no clear precedent in the provided sources for business leaders or sports executives being appointed to paid positions in a presidential administration in the exact context described. However, there are indications of potential future involvement:\n\n- Elon Musk is mentioned as potentially being appointed to lead a \"government efficiency commission\" by President-elect Donald Trump, but this is not a traditional paid position within the administration and has not yet been implemented[2][3].\n\nHistorically, while business leaders have been involved in advisory roles or cabinet positions, the specific scenario of leading a \"government efficiency commission\" as described is not a standard precedent.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump announced any paid positions within his incoming administration since November 6, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nSince November 6, 2024, Donald Trump has announced several paid positions within his incoming administration. These include:\n\n- Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff[1][4][5].\n- Stephen Miller as deputy chief of policy[1][4][5].\n- Tom Homan as the 'border czar'[1][4][5].\n- Elise Stefanik as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations[1][4][5].\n\nThese announcements have been made after November 6, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been credible reports suggesting Dana White is being considered for a paid position in the Trump administration?\nANSWER: There have been reports and speculations, but they are not uniformly credible or consistent in suggesting that Dana White is being considered for a paid position in the Trump administration.\n\nSome sources suggest the possibility of Dana White being given a role in Trump's administration, such as the role of White House press secretary, based on his close friendship with Trump and his appearance at Trump's victory celebration[4][5].\n\nHowever, Dana White himself has explicitly stated that he has no personal political aspirations and intends to remain with the UFC, rather than entering politics[2].\n\nGiven this mixed information, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as there are both speculative reports and direct statements from White that contradict the idea of him taking a paid position in the Trump administration.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been credible reports suggesting Elon Musk is being considered for a paid position in the Trump administration?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are discussions and speculations about Elon Musk's potential role in the Trump administration, but they do not conclusively indicate that he is being considered for a paid position.\n\n- Some sources suggest that Musk is likely to have an informal role rather than a formal Cabinet position that would require Senate confirmation[3].\n- There is a mention of Musk potentially heading a new Department of Government Efficiency, but this is presented as a prospective idea rather than a confirmed appointment[4].\n- Overall, the reports highlight Musk's influence and potential advisory roles, but they do not provide clear evidence that he is being considered for a paid position in the administration.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Elon Musk's involvement in his businesses prevent him from accepting a federal position?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is unclear whether Elon Musk's involvement in his businesses would categorically prevent him from accepting a federal position, but there are significant conflicts of interest and regulatory issues that could complicate such a role.\n\n- Musk's companies have extensive contracts with various federal agencies, which could create conflicts of interest if he were to hold a federal position, especially one involving regulatory oversight[2][3][4].\n- There are ongoing investigations and regulatory scrutiny involving his companies, which could further complicate his potential role in the government[2].\n\nHowever, the sources do not explicitly state that his business involvement would legally or definitively prevent him from accepting a federal position. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately **49 days** left until January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changes, and neither Elon Musk nor Dana White is announced as having been offered a salaried federal position within the incoming Trump Administration before January 1, 2025, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about **12 days** left until the deadline, the probability of either individual being chosen would be even lower due to the limited time for such an announcement. My forecast would be a probability of **3%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **196 days** (about 6.5 months) left until the deadline, there would be more opportunity for developments. My forecast would slightly increase to a probability of **8%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current State of Affairs:** As of November 12, 2024, there have been no credible reports or official announcements indicating that either Elon Musk or Dana White has been offered a salaried federal position within the incoming Trump Administration.\n\n- **Elon Musk:**\n  - *Business Commitments:* Elon Musk is the CEO of multiple high-profile companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, and others. Accepting a federal position could create significant conflicts of interest and divert his attention from his businesses.\n  - *Historical Behavior:* Musk has previously acted as an advisor on government committees but has not taken on formal federal positions.\n  - *Likelihood of Acceptance:* Even if offered, it's uncertain whether Musk would accept a federal role, especially given potential conflicts with his business operations and regulatory concerns.\n\n- **Dana White:**\n  - *Public Statements:* Dana White, President of the UFC, has explicitly stated that he has no intention of entering politics or serving in a government position.\n  - *Lack of Reports:* There are no credible reports suggesting that he is being considered for a position within the Trump Administration.\n\n- **Time Frame:** With only 49 days left until the deadline, and given that key administrative positions are typically announced soon after an election, the window for such an announcement is narrowing.\n\n- **Base Rates and Precedent:**\n  - It's uncommon for high-profile business leaders or sports executives without prior government experience to be appointed to salaried federal positions, especially without prior indications.\n  - Previous administrations have occasionally appointed businessmen to cabinet positions, but these are usually announced well in advance of the inauguration.\n\n- **Mechanisms Driving the Outcome:**\n  - Any appointment would require vetting processes and potential Senate confirmation for certain positions, although the resolution criteria state that Senate confirmation is not necessary for this question.\n  - The urgency and practicality of appointing either individual within the limited time frame are low.\n\n- **Adjustments Based on Time Left:**\n  - With less time (quarter of the time), the probability decreases due to the diminishing likelihood of new appointments.\n  - With more time (4x the time), the probability increases slightly as there is more opportunity for developments, but significant obstacles remain.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
