{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before December 1, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after September 30, 2024, and before December 1, 2024 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements[here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before December 1, 2024, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the Federal Reserve's [target funds rate history page](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the most recent rate cuts were on September 19, 2024, after a few years of relatively higher and rising interest rates. Previous cuts were on March 16, 2020, and March 3, 2020. Before then, there were three separate rate cuts in 2019.  \n\nThe September 2024 FOMC meeting is [scheduled](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/02/12/what-to-expect-from-the-feds-remaining-meetings-of-2024) for September 18th. \n\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information available, it is highly likely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates before December 1, 2024.\n\nHere are the key points that support this likelihood:\n\n## Scheduled Meetings\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has three scheduled meetings remaining in 2024: September 18, November 7, and December 18. Given that the September meeting has already resulted in a rate cut, the focus is on the November meeting.\n\n## Market Expectations and FOMC Signals\nMarkets and FOMC policymakers have indicated that interest rate cuts are expected at all the remaining meetings in 2024. FOMC officials, including Chair Jerome Powell and other members, have expressed a dovish stance, suggesting that the time has come to adjust policy and reduce the federal funds rate further due to easing inflation and a weakening labor market.\n\n## Economic Conditions\nThe current economic conditions, including a slowdown in hiring and a decline in inflation, have led the Fed to consider further rate cuts. The Fed has already cut rates by 50 basis points in September and has signaled potential further cuts, aligning with market expectations of additional reductions by the end of 2024.\n\n## Projections and Forecasts\nThe Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and other forecasts suggest that the Fed will continue to cut interest rates gradually over the rest of 2024 and into 2025. Specifically, there are expectations of another 50 basis points of cuts by the end of 2024, which could be achieved through one or two more rate cuts in November and December.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to conclude that the Federal Reserve is likely to cut interest rates before December 1, 2024, specifically at the November 7 meeting.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Reserve scheduled FOMC meetings before December 1, 2024, where rate cuts could be announced?\nANSWER: Yes, the Federal Reserve has scheduled FOMC meetings before December 1, 2024, where rate cuts could be announced.\n\n- The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for November 6-7, 2024, and there is a high likelihood of a rate cut at this meeting, as indicated by the CME FedWatch Tool and analyst predictions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the Federal Reserve maintain higher interest rates throughout 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, the Federal Reserve maintained higher interest rates throughout 2023. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- From March 2022 to July 2023, the Fed increased the federal-funds rate by 5.25 percentage points, with the final increase in July 2023 bringing the rate to a target range of 5.25% to 5.50%.\n- This higher rate was maintained from July 2023 until the first rate cut in September 2024.\n\nTherefore, the Federal Reserve kept the interest rates at these elevated levels throughout 2023.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Reserve historically cut interest rates during periods of economic slowdown?\nANSWER: Yes, the Federal Reserve has historically cut interest rates during periods of economic slowdown or to prevent a recession.\n\n- In the past, the Fed has made significant rate cuts to mitigate economic downturns. For example, in 2001 and 2007, the Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points to try to stabilize an already volatile economy, although these cuts did not prevent recessions in those instances.\n- The Fed's current actions, such as the recent half-percentage point rate cut, are also aimed at addressing labor market softening and preventing further economic slowdown, indicating a similar historical pattern of responding to economic slowdowns with rate cuts.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are financial markets anticipating a rate cut by the Federal Reserve before December 1, 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nFinancial markets and economists are anticipating further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve before December 1, 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Fed has signaled potential further cuts, with expectations of 50 additional basis points in reductions by the end of the year, which includes the November and December meetings.\n- Market expectations and FOMC policymakers suggest rate cuts at the remaining 2024 meetings, specifically in November and December.\n- The Fed's economic projections and statements from FOMC members indicate a likelihood of gradual interest rate cuts over the coming months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the labor market expected to weaken in 2024, potentially influencing the Federal Reserve's rate decisions?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThe sources consistently indicate that the labor market is expected to weaken in 2024, which could influence the Federal Reserve's rate decisions.\n\n- The labor market has been showing signs of softening, with slower job growth and revisions indicating fewer job gains than previously thought. For example, the August jobs report showed only 142,000 jobs added, which is fewer than economists expected, and previous months' job gains were revised down.\n\n- The unemployment rate, although it ticked down to 4.2% in August, has been rising over the past year, and there are expectations that it will continue to rise in 2024 and 2025.\n\n- The Federal Reserve is anticipated to respond to this weakening labor market by easing monetary policy, with expectations of rate cuts to prevent further cooling of the labor market.\n\n- Various indicators, such as the job openings rate, quits rate, and layoffs, suggest that labor demand has cooled, and there is a potential for further loosening of the labor market.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest that the labor market is expected to weaken and that this will likely influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Reserve expressed concerns about recession risks in their recent communications?\nANSWER: The Federal Reserve has indeed discussed and analyzed the risks of a recession in their recent communications, although the tone and emphasis have evolved.\n\n- In a speech by Governor Waller, there is a discussion about various economic scenarios, including one where inflation falls below 2% and the labor market deteriorates, which could indicate recession risks. However, the current data suggests that the economy may not be slowing as much as previously thought, leading to a more cautious approach to rate cuts rather than an immediate concern for a recession.\n\n- Chair Powell's speech also touches on the balance of risks, including the downside risks to employment and the potential for further economic adjustments. While the focus is on adjusting policy to maintain a strong labor market and achieve price stability, there is an acknowledgment of the evolving risks and the need to be attentive to both sides of the dual mandate.\n\n- A note on financial conditions and risks to the economic outlook discusses how financial conditions have affected the outlook for GDP growth, employment, and inflation. It mentions that downside risks to employment growth are lower than they were at the end of 2023, but there is still a notable headwind to year-ahead growth and a skewed distribution toward lower GDP growth outcomes. This indicates an ongoing assessment of recession risks, although the note suggests that these risks have decreased somewhat since late 2023.\n\nTherefore, while the Federal Reserve is not sounding an alarm for an imminent recession, they are certainly monitoring and discussing the associated risks in their recent communications.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there geopolitical events as of 2023 that could impact the U.S. economy and prompt a rate cut?\nANSWER: Yes, there are geopolitical events as of 2023 that could potentially impact the U.S. economy and influence monetary policy decisions, including the possibility of rate cuts.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the impact of geopolitical risks on the global and U.S. economies:\n\n1. **War in Ukraine and Other Conflicts**: The ongoing war in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions, such as the conflict between Israel and Hamas, can disrupt global economic performance through higher inflation, lower growth, and significant welfare losses. These events can affect energy prices, trade, and overall economic stability, which in turn could influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates.\n\n2. **Elections and Political Risks**: Elections and increasing political polarization, particularly in the United States, can lead to uncertainty and potentially affect monetary policy. For example, proposed policies such as tariffs and unconventional fiscal measures could disrupt supply chains and impact the U.S. GDP, which might necessitate a response from the Federal Reserve, including potential rate cuts.\n\n3. **Global Economic Outlook**: The IMF's World Economic Outlook and other economic forecasts note that geopolitical conflicts and their associated risks can moderate economic growth and influence inflation, factors that the Federal Reserve considers when making decisions about interest rates.\n\nTherefore, these geopolitical events and their economic implications could indeed prompt the Federal Reserve to consider rate cuts as part of their monetary policy response.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there economic indicators suggesting a slowdown in the U.S. economy as of 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are mixed signals, but some indicators do suggest potential slowdowns or challenges in the U.S. economy, particularly as we look ahead to 2024 rather than 2023 specifically.\n\n### 2023 Overview\nFor 2023, the economy generally defied pessimistic forecasts and showed robust growth driven by strong consumer spending, a revival in manufacturing investment, and low unemployment rates. The White House reports indicate that the economy performed better than expected, with real GDP growth exceeding forecasts, strong job gains, and a low unemployment rate below 4% for an extended period.\n\n### Indicators of Potential Slowdown\nHowever, looking at more recent data and forecasts:\n\n- The Leading Economic Index (LEI) has been declining, which signals potential headwinds to economic growth ahead. The LEI fell by 0.2% in August 2024, and over the six-month period between February and August 2024, it fell by 2.3%. This decline is driven by factors such as new orders, negative interest rate spread, and lower stock prices.\n- Deloitte's forecast indicates that while the baseline scenario remains positive, there are risks such as geopolitical conflicts and trade policy that could lead to persistent inflation and lower GDP growth. The unemployment rate has also risen, triggering some recession indicators, although this is not seen as a cause for immediate concern.\n- The Conference Board expects real GDP growth to lose momentum in the second half of 2024 due to higher prices, elevated interest rates, and mounting debt eroding domestic demand.\n\nIn summary, while 2023 itself saw robust economic growth, there are indicators suggesting a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy as of the second half of 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Reserve signaled an intention to cut interest rates in 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has indeed signaled an intention to cut interest rates in 2024. On September 18, 2024, the Fed announced a 50-basis point (0.5%) interest rate cut, which is the first rate cut since March 2020. Additionally, Fed officials have indicated that more rate cuts are likely in the coming months of 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is U.S. inflation projected to be at or below the Federal Reserve's target rate by early 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it appears that U.S. inflation is not projected to be at or below the Federal Reserve's target rate of 2% by early 2024.\n\n- The USDA ERS report indicates that as of August 2024, the CPI for all food and the overall CPI are still above the 2% target, with the all-items CPI up 2.5% from August 2023 and the food CPI up 2.1% from August 2023.\n- The Morningstar article states that overall PCE inflation was 2.3% year over year as of August 2024, and core PCE inflation was 2.7%. It projects that core PCE inflation will hit 2.0% year over year sometime in the first quarter of 2025, but not by early 2024.\n- The J.P. Morgan report also suggests that while inflation has cooled, it is expected to remain above the 2% target in 2024, with core inflation sticky at around 3% and not expected to drop to 2% without a softer labor market.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nToday is October 25, 2024, and the question resolves on December 1, 2024. Therefore, there are **37 days** left until the outcome is known.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed\u2014that is, if the Federal Reserve did not announce any further rate cuts between now and December 1, 2024\u2014the outcome would be **No**, the Fed did not cut interest rates in the specified time frame.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only approximately **9 days** left until December 1, 2024, and assuming no rate cut has been announced yet, I would forecast a **low probability** (around **10%**) that the Fed would cut rates before the deadline.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **148 days** left until December 1, 2024 (extending the deadline hypothetically), I would forecast a **higher probability** (around **90%**) that the Fed would cut rates before the new deadline, given more time for economic conditions to evolve and for additional FOMC meetings to occur.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**Current Economic Context:**\n\n1. **Scheduled FOMC Meetings:** The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has one scheduled meeting before December 1, 2024, on **November 7, 2024**. This meeting is a key opportunity for the Fed to announce a rate cut within the question's time frame.\n\n2. **Recent Monetary Policy Actions:** The Fed cut interest rates by 50 basis points in **September 2024**, signaling a shift towards easing monetary policy after a period of higher rates throughout 2023 and early 2024.\n\n3. **Economic Indicators:**\n\n   - **Inflation:** Inflation has been easing, moving closer to the Fed's target rate of 2%. However, some projections suggest inflation may not reach the target until 2025.\n   \n   - **Labor Market:** The labor market is showing signs of weakening, with slower job growth and rising unemployment rates. This softening increases the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates to support employment.\n   \n   - **Economic Growth:** Indicators such as the Leading Economic Index (LEI) have been declining, suggesting potential headwinds to economic growth. The Fed may cut rates to stimulate the economy and mitigate risks of a slowdown.\n\n4. **Market Expectations:**\n\n   - Financial markets and analysts widely anticipate another rate cut before the end of 2024. The CME FedWatch Tool and various economic forecasts suggest a high probability of a rate cut at the November meeting.\n   \n   - **Fed Communications:** Statements from Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have been dovish, indicating openness to further rate cuts. The Fed has signaled intentions to adjust policy in response to easing inflation and labor market conditions.\n\n5. **Historical Patterns:**\n\n   - The Fed has historically cut rates during periods of economic slowdown to stimulate growth. Given current conditions, a rate cut aligns with past Fed actions in similar scenarios.\n\n**Considerations for the Probability Estimate:**\n\n- **High Probability Factors:**\n\n  - **Scheduled Opportunity:** With an FOMC meeting on November 7, there is a clear opportunity for the Fed to announce a rate cut within the specified time frame.\n  \n  - **Economic Justification:** The combination of easing inflation and a weakening labor market provides economic justification for a rate cut.\n  \n  - **Market Alignment:** Aligning policy actions with market expectations helps maintain market stability and credibility.\n\n- **Uncertainty Factors:**\n\n  - **Data Dependence:** The Fed has emphasized that decisions are data-dependent. Unexpected economic data releases between now and the meeting could influence their decision.\n  \n  - **Inflation Persistence:** If inflation shows signs of remaining above target or re-accelerating, the Fed might delay further cuts.\n  \n  - **Geopolitical Risks:** Unforeseen geopolitical events could alter economic conditions, impacting the Fed's policy stance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the scheduled FOMC meeting on November 7, 2024, the current economic indicators pointing towards a slowdown, easing inflation, dovish signals from the Fed, and strong market expectations for a rate cut, there is a **high probability** that the Federal Reserve will announce a rate cut before December 1, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 85%**", "probability": 85}
