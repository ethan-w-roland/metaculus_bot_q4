{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the USDA-posted recall of Boar's Head deli meat be closed before December 1, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-23\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc., is changed from Active to Closed when [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/boars-head-provisions-co--expands-recall-ready-eat-meat-and-poultry-products-due) is accessed by Metaculus after November 30, 2024.  If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/10/health/boars-head-deli-meat-listeria.html), \"Genome sequencing tests by public health officials in New York and Maryland tied a strain of listeria found in Boar\u2019s Head liverwurst to the bacteria from people who died or fell ill, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The company recalled its liverwurst late in July. Days later, Boar\u2019s Head expanded the recall to cover more than 3,500 tons of meat \u2014 including ham and other items made in the Jarratt facility, one of several it operates. Production at the meat processing center in a rural part of the state has been temporarily stopped. Boar\u2019s Head said it was disinfecting the plant and trying to determine the cause of the suspected contamination. Nine elderly people have died and dozens were hospitalized in the worst listeria outbreak in years. Public health experts have expressed worry that those numbers could increase, because symptoms can emerge weeks later. They also noted that consumers might not be aware of the recall, and some of the products do not expire until October.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the USDA-posted recall of Boar's Head deli meat will be closed before December 1, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Recall Scope and Duration\n- The recall was initiated on July 25, 2024, and expanded on July 29, 2024, to include all products produced at the Jarratt, Virginia plant due to potential contamination with *Listeria monocytogenes*.\n- The recall involves approximately 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products, with sell-by dates extending into October 2024.\n\n## Ongoing Investigation and Monitoring\n- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) are still monitoring the situation, as symptoms of listeriosis can take up to 10 weeks to appear. This means that new cases could still be reported, and the investigation is ongoing.\n\n## Plant Closure and Safety Measures\n- The Jarratt, Virginia plant, where the contaminated products were produced, has been closed indefinitely since late July 2024. Boar's Head is implementing enhanced food safety and quality measures, including the appointment of a new Chief Food Safety & Quality Assurance Officer.\n\n## Recall Effectiveness Checks\n- FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to ensure that the recalling firm notifies their customers and that the recalled products are removed from the market. This process can take time and may not be completed before December 1, 2024, especially given the extensive nature of the recall.\n\nGiven these points, it is unclear whether the recall will be officially closed before December 1, 2024, as it depends on the completion of the ongoing investigation, the removal of all recalled products from the market, and the satisfaction of regulatory bodies that all necessary steps have been taken to ensure public safety. The complexity and scope of the recall, combined with the ongoing monitoring for potential new cases, suggest that the process may extend beyond this date.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Jarratt, Virginia plant resumed operations since its closure in July 2024?\nANSWER: NO, the Jarratt, Virginia plant has not resumed operations since its closure in July 2024. According to the sources, Boar's Head announced the indefinite closure of the plant due to the severe listeria outbreak, and it has been inactive since late July 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have all recall effectiveness checks been completed by the FSIS for the Boar's Head recall?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether all recall effectiveness checks have been completed by the FSIS for the Boar's Head recall. The sources mention that FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that recalling firms notify their customers and take necessary steps, but they do not specify that these checks have been completed for this particular recall.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any new cases of listeriosis linked to Boar's Head products reported since October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no information available that updates the status of the listeriosis outbreak linked to Boar's Head products beyond the dates mentioned in the articles, which are up to late September 2024. Therefore, it is unclear whether there have been any new cases reported since October 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the FSIS changed the status of the Boar's Head recall from Active to Closed as of today?\nANSWER: No, the FSIS has not changed the status of the Boar's Head recall from Active to Closed as of today. The sources indicate that the recall is still ongoing and that investigations and public health actions are continuing.\n\n- The USA Today article mentions that the \"Current status\" of the Boar's Head recall is that the Jarratt facility is closed, but the investigation is ongoing.\n- The Boar's Head official page also states that the recall is ongoing and that they are working on enhanced food safety measures.\n- The CDC update confirms that the recall is still active and advises against consuming the recalled products.\n\nTherefore, the status of the recall remains active.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the CDC concluded its investigation into the listeria outbreak associated with Boar's Head products?\nANSWER: The CDC has not concluded its investigation into the listeria outbreak associated with Boar's Head products. The sources indicate that the investigation is ongoing, with continued collection of data and updates on the outbreak.\n\n- The CDC update on September 25, 2024, mentions that \"CDC continues to gather information to understand which deli meats are causing illness in this outbreak\".\n- The August 28, 2024, update also notes that the investigation is ongoing and provides updated numbers of illnesses and deaths, indicating that the investigation has not been concluded.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have all sell-by dates for the recalled Boar's Head products passed as of now?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe recalled Boar's Head products have sell-by dates that range from July 25, 2024, to October 17, 2024. Since the current date is October 23, 2024, not all sell-by dates have passed, as some extend into October.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc., completed the disinfection of the Jarratt, Virginia plant?\nANSWER: The sources indicate that Boar's Head Provisions Co., Inc. has not completed the disinfection of the Jarratt, Virginia plant, and in fact, the plant has been closed indefinitely.\n\n- The company stated that it is taking the necessary time to sanitize, improve policies and procedures, and train staff, but there is no mention that this process has been completed.\n- The plant has been inactive since late July 2024, and the company announced its indefinite closure, which suggests that the disinfection and other corrective measures are part of an ongoing process rather than a completed task.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as the sources do not confirm the completion of the disinfection process)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Boar's Head met all regulatory requirements necessary for the FSIS to close the recall?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether Boar's Head has met all the regulatory requirements necessary for the FSIS to close the recall.\n\nThe sources indicate that Boar's Head has taken significant steps, including a voluntary recall of approximately 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat and poultry products, and cooperating with the FSIS and other health agencies to investigate and address the contamination issue.\n\nHowever, there is also mention that the FSIS has suspended inspection at the Boar's Head establishment in Jarratt, Virginia, due to numerous violations, including the presence of mold, mildew, and insects. This suggests that the plant remains closed until these issues are resolved.\n\nThere is no explicit information in the sources indicating that all regulatory requirements for closing the recall have been met, such as confirmation from the FSIS that the necessary corrective actions have been taken and verified.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average duration for the FSIS to close a recall of this magnitude less than four months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the process and timeline for closing a recall by the FSIS (Food Safety and Inspection Service) can vary, but there are some specific guidelines that indicate the general timeframe.\n\n- For the recall closure process, the firm must send a closeout memo to FSIS with details such as the list of customers, amount of product retrieved, actions taken, and disposition of returned product. After this, FSIS issues a closeout letter to the firm and moves the recall from the current recalls page to the recall case archive[3|.\n- The sources do not specify a strict average duration for closing all recalls, but they do outline that certain steps must be completed within specific timeframes. For example, for Class I recalls, effectiveness checks begin within 3 days and are substantially complete within 10 days[3|.\n- However, the overall process, including reimbursement and final closeout, can extend up to 90 calendar days in some cases, especially for reimbursement processes.\n\nGiven this information, while some aspects of the recall process can be completed within a few weeks, the entire process from initiation to final closeout can indeed extend beyond a few months in some cases. However, it is not explicitly stated that the average duration is less than four months.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the FSIS typically keep recalls open until all potentially contaminated products are confirmed removed from the market?\nANSWER: The FSIS (Food Safety and Inspection Service) does indeed take steps to ensure that recalled products are removed from the market, but the process involves ongoing verification and follow-up.\n\n- FSIS conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify that the recalling firm has notified their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.\n- FSIS continues to gather distribution information and updates the list of recalled products as more information becomes available, ensuring that consumers have the necessary information to identify and remove recalled products from their possession.\n- If FSIS determines that a firm's recall strategy or execution is ineffective, they may investigate further and take additional actions, such as seeking enforcement action against the recalling firm or its consignees.\n\nTherefore, the FSIS typically keeps recalls open and actively monitors the situation until they are satisfied that all potentially contaminated products have been identified and removed from the market.\n\n**YES**", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: There are 38 days remaining until December 1, 2024.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed**: If nothing changes, the recall status would remain active, and the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: With approximately 9.5 days left, the probability of the recall being closed before December 1, 2024, would be very low.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left**: With about 152 days remaining, the probability of the recall being closed before the deadline would increase but still depend on several unresolved factors.\n\n**Rationale**:\n\n- The recall was initiated and expanded in late July 2024 due to a severe listeria outbreak linked to Boar's Head products.\n- As of October 23, 2024, the recall remains active, and the status has not changed to closed.\n- The Jarratt, Virginia plant remains closed indefinitely, and disinfection and corrective measures are ongoing.\n- Not all sell-by dates for the recalled products have passed; some extend into October 2024, which means contaminated products could still be in consumers' possession.\n- The FSIS typically keeps recalls open until all potentially contaminated products are confirmed removed from the market and all regulatory requirements are met.\n- The complexity and severity of this recall, including multiple deaths and ongoing investigations, suggest that the closure process may extend beyond the deadline.\n- With only 38 days left until December 1, 2024, it is unlikely that all necessary steps for closing the recall will be completed.\n\n**Probability: 10%**", "probability": 10}
