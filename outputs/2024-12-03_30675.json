    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill be Donald Trump's net favorability rating on December 27, 2024 be greater than or equal to -6 and less than or equal to -4?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-03\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if the net favorability rating of Donald Trump for December 27, 2024, is greater than or equal to -6 and less than or equal to -4, as reported by 538 after that date. The resolution will be based on the already-calculated net rating presented on 538. A higher percentage for \"Unfavorable\" will result in a negative resolution. A higher percentage for \"Favorable\" means that this question will resolve as >0.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf no value for December 27, 2024 has been published until January 7, 2025, the closest values will be used to resolve this question, provided that these are for any date after December 20, 2024 and before January 3, 2025.\r\n\r\nIn that case, the resolution will be calculated as follows: If there is one, unambiguous closest value (e.g., a value for December 26, 2024 is shown on the site but not one for December 28, 2024), the question will resolve as that. If there are two equidistant closest values, then the question will resolve as their average.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/) aggregates polling data from various pollsters to calculate a weighted favorability rating. After winning the US election, Trump's net favorability (% of people that have a favorable opinion - % that have an unfavorable one) has increased from -8.6 on November 4, 2024 to -6 on November 21, the highest score of the previous 4 years.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Donald Trump's net favorability rating being between -6 and -4 on December 27, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Favorability Ratings\n- Recent polls indicate that Trump's favorability ratings have seen some fluctuations but generally remain polarized. For example, an Emerson College poll post-election showed Trump with a 54% approval rating, but this is not a direct measure of net favorability[1].\n- A survey from October 2024 found that 44% of Americans had a very unfavorable view of Trump, while 29% had a very favorable view. This translates to a significant net negative favorability[2].\n- FiveThirtyEight's polling averages show that Trump's net favorability has often been negative, with some polls indicating a net favorability around -1 to -8[3].\n\n## Post-Election Trends\n- Following the 2024 election, Trump's favorability has seen some increases, particularly among certain demographics. However, these increases are not uniform and vary by gender, age, and party affiliation[1].\n- The net favorability has improved slightly post-election, but it remains generally negative. For instance, one poll showed a net favorability of +1, while another indicated a net favorability of -6[3].\n\n## Historical Context\n- Trump's favorability ratings have historically been highly polarized, with strong support from Republicans and strong opposition from Democrats. This polarization suggests that significant shifts in net favorability are less common[4].\n\n## Predictive Considerations\n- Given the current data, a net favorability rating between -6 and -4 is plausible but not guaranteed. The community prediction on Metaculus, for example, reflects a range of possible outcomes, but it does not provide a clear consensus within the specified range[5].\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, Trump's net favorability has rarely been positive and often hovers around negative values. This historical trend suggests that a net favorability between -6 and -4 is within the realm of possibility but should be considered in the context of ongoing political events and public opinion shifts.\n\nIn summary, while a net favorability rating between -6 and -4 is possible, it is not clear whether it will fall exactly within this range on December 27, 2024. The answer cannot be definitively determined as yes or no based on the current information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Donald Trump release any new policy proposals between November 1, 2024, and December 27, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of new policy proposals released by Donald Trump between November 1, 2024, and December 27, 2024.

Here are some key points:\n\n- Trump was facing prosecution in Georgia for his 2020 election plot, and his election as president could halt this prosecution[1].\n- He had a conviction in New York for covering up a hush money scheme in 2016, and his lawyers have formally asked a judge to throw out this conviction[3][4].\n- Trump's lawyers are also expected to ask for the dismissal of various filing deadlines related to his federal cases, given his imminent ascent to the White House[1].\n- There are ongoing discussions and actions regarding the pending criminal and civil cases against him, including the potential impact of his presidency on these cases[1][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did public opinion towards Donald Trump shift positively in any major demographic groups between November 1, 2024, and December 27, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence that public opinion towards Donald Trump shifted positively in some major demographic groups following his election.\n\n- The CBS News poll indicates that Trump's handling of his presidential transition and his Cabinet picks received approval from most Americans, particularly from his voters and Republicans. It also mentions that Republicans are more excited about what Trump will do as president now than they were in 2016, and there has been an increase in the number of Republicans who say democracy and the rule of law are secure after Trump's win[1].\n\n- The polls also show that Trump's voters and Republicans have become more optimistic about the economy and Trump's policies, such as tariffs, which suggests a positive shift in opinion within these groups[1].\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that public opinion towards Donald Trump did shift positively in major demographic groups, particularly among his voters and Republicans, between November 1, 2024, and December 27, 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did any significant political events involving Donald Trump occur between November 1, 2024, and December 27, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, several significant political events involving Donald Trump occurred between November 1, 2024, and December 27, 2024.

    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- **24 days** (from December 3, 2024, to December 27, 2024)\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- If current trends remain unchanged, Donald Trump's net favorability rating would likely stay around **-6**, as it was on November 21, 2024.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- With approximately **6 days** left, the forecast would lean towards the current trend persisting, but with slightly increased uncertainty due to the short timeframe. Probability might be around **60%** for staying within the -6 to -4 range.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- Hypothetically extending the timeframe to **96 days** would allow for more significant shifts based on political events, legal developments, and public sentiment changes. However, since the actual timeframe is shorter, this serves as a theoretical consideration indicating that with more time, the probability might stabilize closer to the midpoint of the range.\n\n**Rationale:**\nDonald Trump's net favorability rating has shown fluctuations but remains within a negative range, currently at -6. Given the 24-day period until December 27, it's plausible that his favorability could fluctuate slightly but remain within the -6 to -4 range. Factors such as ongoing legal issues, public appearances, and policy announcements could influence small shifts in either direction. Historical trends suggest that significant positive shifts are less common, but minor improvements are possible, especially within supportive demographics.\n\nConsidering the balance of current data, historical context, and the short timeframe remaining, there's a moderate to high likelihood that his net favorability will fall within the specified range.\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
