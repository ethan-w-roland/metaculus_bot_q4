    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Donald Trump sweep all 7 battleground states in the 2024 election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-31\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald Trump wins the popular vote in Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin in the 2024 presidential election. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nNewsweek: [Electoral College Map Projector Flips All Battleground States to Donald Trump](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-polls-swing-states-1971095)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Donald Trump sweeping all 7 battleground states in the 2024 election, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Polling and Forecasts\n- Nate Silver's latest model, as of early October, suggests that while it is possible for a single candidate to win all seven pivotal states, the probability is not overwhelmingly in Trump's favor. The model indicates that Vice President Harris has a greater likelihood of securing all seven competitive states compared to Trump.\n\n## Simulation Outcomes\n- Out of 70,000 simulations conducted by Silver's model, the scenario where Trump wins all seven states occurred 13,912 times, whereas Harris winning all seven states appeared 15,273 times. This suggests that Harris has a slightly higher probability of sweeping the states.\n\n## Overall Probabilities\n- Silver's forecast as of Sunday morning indicated about a 40 percent chance that either candidate could sweep all seven swing states. Specifically, he assessed a 56 percent probability of Harris winning the Electoral College and a 44 percent probability for Trump.\n\n## Competitive Nature of the Election\n- The election is described as highly competitive, with national polling averages showing Harris leading by a narrow margin of nearly 2 points over Trump. State-level polls also indicate tight races, with Harris slightly ahead in some states and tied in others, such as Georgia.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historical data on presidential elections often show that sweeping all swing states is rare, but the current forecasts suggest it is within the realm of possibility for either candidate. However, the probabilities slightly favor Harris over Trump.\n\nGiven this information, while it is possible for Donald Trump to sweep all 7 battleground states, the current forecasts and simulations suggest that this outcome is less likely compared to Harris achieving the same feat. Therefore, the answer to whether Trump will sweep all 7 battleground states cannot be clearly stated as a yes or no based on the available data, as it remains a probabilistic outcome rather than a certain one.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has any presidential candidate in recent history won all seven of these battleground states in a single election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information that addresses whether any presidential candidate in recent history has won all seven of the mentioned battleground states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) in a single election.\n\nTherefore, the answer to this question is:\n\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently leading in the polls in North Carolina?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe sources indicate that the race in North Carolina is extremely close and within the margin of error, but they do not show Donald Trump leading. According to the CNN polls, Kamala Harris leads slightly by 48% to Trump's 47%, which is within the margin of error.\n\nAdditionally, another source describes the race as essentially tied. Therefore, there is no clear indication that Donald Trump is currently leading in the polls in North Carolina.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently leading in the polls in Nevada?\nANSWER: NO\n\nBased on the latest polling data, Kamala Harris is either slightly ahead or the race is essentially tied, but there is no indication that Donald Trump is currently leading in the polls in Nevada.\n\n- A poll average from The Hill shows Harris with a 0.2% lead over Trump.\n- CNN reports that the race in Nevada is very close, with Harris and Trump running near even.\n- The New York Times also indicates that the race is tight, with neither candidate having a significant lead.\n- Forbes mentions that Harris holds a lead in the latest survey, although it is a small margin.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently leading in the polls in Arizona?\nANSWER: Based on the latest polling data available from the sources:\n\n- From FiveThirtyEight, the polling averages show that the race is very close, but there is no clear indication that Donald Trump is consistently leading.\n- The Hill and DDHQ report that Trump has a 1.9% lead based on 61 polls, with Trump at 49.1% and Harris at 47.2%.\n- The New York Times also indicates that the race is essentially tied, but does not provide a clear lead for Trump.\n\nGiven this information, while the race is extremely close, the data from The Hill and DDHQ suggests that Donald Trump has a slight lead in the polls in Arizona.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do current election models predict Donald Trump winning all seven battleground states?\nANSWER: No, current election models do not predict Donald Trump winning all seven battleground states. The sources indicate that the race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is closely contested and that the outcome in these battleground states is far from certain.\n\n- The reports highlight the intense campaigning and close polling in these states, suggesting that both candidates have a chance of winning in various battleground states.\n- There is no indication from the sources that any model predicts a sweep of all seven battleground states by either candidate.\n\nTherefore, the current election models do not predict Donald Trump winning all seven battleground states.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently leading in the polls in Georgia?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer to whether Donald Trump is currently leading in the polls in Georgia is somewhat nuanced but can be summarized as follows:\n\n- Some polls indicate that Trump has a slight lead. For example, a recent Rasmussen Reports poll shows Trump leading Harris by 51% to 46%, which is outside the margin of error.\n- Other sources, such as The Hill and DDHQ, show Trump with a narrow lead of 1.1% (48.2% to 47.1%).\n- CNN polls suggest that the race is nearly even, with Trump at 48% and Harris at 47%, which is within the margin of error.\n\nGiven these sources, it appears that Donald Trump is generally ahead, although the lead is often within or just outside the margin of error.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently leading in the polls in Michigan?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the answer to whether Donald Trump is currently leading in the polls in Michigan is unclear due to the conflicting results from different polls.\n\n- A Washington Post poll from October 24 to 28 shows Trump leading among registered voters by 2 points, but Harris leading among likely voters by 1 point.\n- Another source mentions that Trump leads in the latest survey, but also notes that aggregate polling data suggests a slight lead for Harris.\n- FiveThirtyEight's polling averages indicate Harris has a marginal lead over Trump.\n- A CNN poll suggests Harris has a narrow edge in Michigan.\n- A USA Today poll describes the race as a \"razor-thin\" contest, with the candidates only 1 point apart in a key county.\n\nGiven these varying results, it is not clear who is definitively leading in the polls in Michigan.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently leading in the polls in Pennsylvania?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the answer to whether Donald Trump is currently leading in the polls in Pennsylvania is not clear.\n\n- The sources provide various insights into the polling landscape, but they do not offer a consistent or up-to-date picture of who is leading. For example, the CBS News article mentions that the race in Pennsylvania is \"effectively tied\" a week before Election Day, but it does not provide the most current polling data.\n- The USA Today article discusses recent polls but does not specify the current leader in Pennsylvania.\n- The FiveThirtyEight page provides polling averages, but without the most recent data or a clear indication of the current leader at the time of the query.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Donald Trump currently leading in the polls in Wisconsin?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the answer to whether Donald Trump is currently leading in the polls in Wisconsin is not consistently clear across all sources.\n\n- The Marquette Law School Poll, often considered a reliable source, shows that as of the latest data (October 1-24, 2024), Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is supported by 50% of likely voters, while there is no explicit mention of Donald Trump leading.\n- The USAToday article and the FiveThirtyEight polls do not provide a clear indication that Donald Trump is leading in Wisconsin as of the latest updates.\n- However, a Newsweek article suggests that Donald Trump has received good news from a 'gold standard' Wisconsin poll, but this does not necessarily mean he is currently leading in all polls or averages.\n\nGiven the mixed and incomplete information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are significant third-party candidates affecting the 2024 election outcomes in these battleground states?\nANSWER: Yes, significant third-party candidates are likely to affect the 2024 election outcomes in battleground states. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:\n\n- Third-party candidates have historically influenced the outcomes in crucial presidential battleground states, and this trend is expected to continue in the 2024 election.\n- Candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Jill Stein, Cornel West, and Chase Oliver are on the ballots in several key states, including Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, and Pennsylvania. Their presence could siphon votes away from the major party candidates, potentially altering the election results.\n- The tight margins in swing states mean that even a small number of votes diverted to third-party candidates could be decisive. For example, a bloc of 10,000 voters choosing a third-party candidate over a major party candidate could swing the outcome in a closely contested state.\n- The impact of third-party voting is not just about the immediate election results but also about influencing the platforms of major party candidates. The threat of losing votes to third-party candidates can prompt major party candidates to adjust their positions to attract those voters.\n\nGiven these factors, it is clear that significant third-party candidates are positioned to affect the 2024 election outcomes in battleground states.\n\nYES",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nApproximately one week. The U.S. presidential election is scheduled for November 5, 2024. Given that it's October 31, 2024, the results for these battleground states are typically known within a day or two after Election Day. Therefore, the outcome should be known by November 6 or 7, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current polling trends and forecasts hold steady, Donald Trump is leading in some battleground states but trailing or tied in others. Specifically:\n\n- **Leading:** Arizona and Georgia\n- **Trailing or Tied:** Nevada, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin\n\nGiven this distribution, it's unlikely that Trump would win all seven battleground states if nothing changes. The outcome would likely be **No**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only a couple of days left before the election, the probability of significant shifts in voter sentiment is minimal. Voters have largely made up their minds, and early voting has already occurred in many states. Therefore, the likelihood of Trump sweeping all seven states would be slightly **lower** than it is now, reinforcing a probable **No** outcome.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately four weeks remaining until the election, there would be more time for events to influence voter preferences—such as debates, economic changes, or significant news stories. This could either increase or decrease Trump's chances. However, significant swings are less common in modern elections. The probability might be slightly **higher** than it is now but would still lean towards a **No** outcome.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nTo estimate the probability of Donald Trump winning all seven battleground states, we'll assess the likelihood in each state based on current polling and then calculate the combined probability.\n\n1. **Nevada**:\n   - **Current Status**: Trump is not leading.\n   - **Estimated Probability of Trump Winning**: 45%\n\n2. **Arizona**:\n   - **Current Status**: Trump has a slight lead.\n   - **Estimated Probability of Trump Winning**: 55%\n\n3. **Georgia**:\n   - **Current Status**: Trump has a slight lead.\n   - **Estimated Probability of Trump Winning**: 55%\n\n4. **North Carolina**:\n   - **Current Status**: Trump is trailing or tied.\n   - **Estimated Probability of Trump Winning**: 50%\n\n5. **Pennsylvania**:\n   - **Current Status**: Too close to call; tied.\n   - **Estimated Probability of Trump Winning**: 50%\n\n6. **Michigan**:\n   - **Current Status**: Too close to call; tied.\n   - **Estimated Probability of Trump Winning**: 50%\n\n7. **Wisconsin**:\n   - **Current Status**: Too close to call; tied.\n   - **Estimated Probability of Trump Winning**: 50%\n\n**Calculating the Combined Probability:**\n\nAssuming the outcomes in each state are independent (an oversimplification, as electoral outcomes in states can be correlated), we multiply the probabilities:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nP(\\text{Trump wins all seven states}) & = P(\\text{Nevada}) \\times P(\\text{Arizona}) \\times P(\\text{Georgia}) \\times P(\\text{North Carolina}) \\times P(\\text{Pennsylvania}) \\times P(\\text{Michigan}) \\times P(\\text{Wisconsin}) \\\\\n&= 0.45 \\times 0.55 \\times 0.55 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.50 \\\\\n&= 0.45 \\times 0.3025 \\times 0.0625 \\\\\n&= 0.45 \\times 0.3025 \\times 0.0625 \\\\\n&\\approx 0.0085 \\\\\n&= 0.85\\%\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- **Correlation Between States**: In reality, state outcomes are not entirely independent. Voter sentiments can shift in multiple states due to national events. However, even accounting for positive correlation, the probability remains low.\n- **Historical Precedent**: Sweeping all battleground states is historically rare and would require favorable conditions across diverse regions.\n- **Third-Party Candidates**: The presence of significant third-party candidates can affect vote splits, potentially reducing the likelihood of any candidate sweeping all battleground states.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the current data and considering the factors above, the probability that Donald Trump will win all seven battleground states is low.\n\n**Probability: 1%**",
