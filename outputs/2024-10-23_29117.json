{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the New York Yankees lose the 2024 World Series in baseball in exactly 6 games?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-23\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the New York Yankees lose the 2024 World Series in exactly 6 games played in the Series, as reported by [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) such as [Major League Baseball](https://www.mlb.com/news/2024-mlb-playoff-and-world-series-schedule). If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe World Series is a best-of-7 series, and in the event of an edge case such as the Series being shortened to fewer games, lengthened to more games (as happened [in 1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_World_Series) or the Series being canceled (as happened [in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_World_Series) due to a player strike) or excessively delayed, this question will resolve as **No** if the Yankees have not both lost the World Series and done it in exactly 6 games, before January 1, 2025. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe 2024 baseball World Series is scheduled to begin on October 25, 2024, between the  NY Yankees, who are the American League champions, and the LA Dodgers, who are the champions of the National League.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the New York Yankees losing the 2024 World Series in exactly 6 games, here are some relevant points and context:\n\n## Teams Involved\nThe 2024 World Series features the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers, two teams with significant star power and historical success in baseball.\n\n## Recent Performance\n- The Yankees have advanced to the World Series with strong performances from their key players, including Juan Soto, Aaron Judge, and Giancarlo Stanton. Soto's crucial home run in the ALCS Game 5 against Cleveland was pivotal in their advancement.\n- The Dodgers, despite facing injuries, have managed to maintain a strong lineup and pitching staff, including stars like Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Freddie Freeman.\n\n## Historical Context\n- The Yankees and Dodgers have a rich history of World Series matchups, with the Yankees holding an 8-3 advantage in their previous encounters.\n\n## Current Form and Strategies\n- The Yankees rely heavily on their big hitters and a bullpen that has shown unexpected strength, particularly with Luke Weaver's emergence as a closer.\n- The Dodgers' success hinges on their ability to sustain their offensive momentum and effective management of their pitching staff and bullpen.\n\n## Predictions and Analysis\n- The series is expected to be closely contested, with both teams having the potential to win. The Dodgers have home-field advantage, which could be a significant factor.\n\nGiven these points, predicting the exact outcome of the series, including the number of games, is challenging without additional specific data or insights into the teams' current form and potential strategies for the series. However, here are some general considerations:\n\n- **Base Rates**: Historically, World Series can go anywhere from 4 to 7 games, with no clear base rate favoring a specific number of games.\n- **Team Strengths**: Both teams have strong lineups and pitching, suggesting a closely contested series.\n- **Home-Field Advantage**: The Dodgers have home-field advantage, which could influence the outcome but does not guarantee a specific number of games.\n\nWithout more specific data or a clear trend indicating a 6-game series, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the Yankees will lose in exactly 6 games. The outcome will depend on various factors, including team performance, managerial decisions, and any unforeseen events during the series.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the 2024 World Series started yet?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe 2024 World Series is scheduled to start on Friday, October 25, and has not begun yet as of the current date, October 23.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers confirmed to play in the 2024 World Series?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers are confirmed to play in the 2024 World Series, as stated in multiple sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the New York Yankees' pitching staff considered weaker than the Los Angeles Dodgers' pitching staff in 2024?\nANSWER: The information provided does not include a direct comparison between the New York Yankees' pitching staff and the Los Angeles Dodgers' pitching staff for the 2024 season. The sources detail the Yankees' pitching roster, injuries, and projections for their pitchers, but they do not provide any data or analysis comparing these to the Dodgers' pitching staff.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do the Los Angeles Dodgers have home-field advantage in the 2024 World Series?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers have home-field advantage in the 2024 World Series because they finished the regular season with the best record in the league, 98-64 (.605), which is better than the New York Yankees' record of 94-68 (.580).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any factors that could cause the 2024 World Series to be canceled, shortened, or delayed past January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any factors that could cause the 2024 World Series to be canceled, shortened, or delayed past January 1, 2025. The sources focus on the teams' performances, strategies, and player analyses, but do not discuss any potential disruptions or delays to the schedule of the World Series.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as there is no information provided in the sources to indicate any such factors.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are expert analysts predicting that the Los Angeles Dodgers will defeat the New York Yankees in exactly 6 games in the 2024 World Series?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of expert analysts predicting that the Los Angeles Dodgers will defeat the New York Yankees in exactly 6 games in the 2024 World Series. The sources provide general previews, schedules, and historical context, but they do not include specific predictions about the exact number of games the series will last.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the New York Yankees shown poor performance in the postseason leading up to the 2024 World Series?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that the New York Yankees have performed well in the postseason leading up to the 2024 World Series. Here are some key points:\n\n- The Yankees beat the Cleveland Guardians 4-1 in the American League Championship Series (ALCS) to advance to the World Series.\n- They had a strong regular season, clinching the AL East division with a 93-66 record, and later improved to 94-68 by the end of the campaign.\n- Key players such as Giancarlo Stanton, Aaron Judge, and Juan Soto have been in excellent form during the postseason.\n\nThese points suggest that the Yankees have not shown poor performance in the postseason leading up to the 2024 World Series.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do historical statistics favor the Los Angeles Dodgers winning the World Series when they have home-field advantage?\nANSWER: Historical statistics suggest that having home-field advantage does provide some advantage, but it is not a guarantee of winning the World Series.\n\n- Teams with home-field advantage in the World Series since the Wild Card Era (1995) have won the championship 19 out of 28 times, which is a 67.9% success rate, excluding the 2020 World Series played at a neutral site.\n- However, when it comes to winner-take-all Game 7s, the impact of home field is less pronounced. Home teams are 19-21 in these critical World Series matchups and 64-66 in all winner-take-all postseason games.\n\nWhile these statistics indicate that having home-field advantage is beneficial, they do not guarantee a win for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Therefore, the answer is that historical statistics do favor the Dodgers to some extent, but they do not ensure a victory.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any key players on the New York Yankees been injured prior to the 2024 World Series?\nANSWER: Yes, several key players on the New York Yankees have been injured prior to the 2024 World Series.\n\n- Nestor Cortes, a starting pitcher, is on the 15-day injured list with a left elbow flexor strain but is expected to be available for the World Series if the Yankees advance.\n- DJ LeMahieu, the third baseman, is on the 10-day injured list with a hip injury.\n- Jonathan Lo\u00e1isiga, a relief pitcher, is on the 60-day injured list with a right flexor strain and will not be available for the World Series.\n- Lou Trivino, a relief pitcher, is on the 60-day injured list due to elbow issues.\n- JT Brubaker, a starting pitcher, is also on the 60-day injured list with elbow and oblique injuries.\n\nThese injuries involve significant players and could impact the team's performance in the World Series.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the World Series ended in exactly 6 games more frequently than other lengths in recent years?\nANSWER: In recent years, the World Series has not consistently ended in exactly 6 games more frequently than other lengths. Here are some observations from the sources:\n\n- The 2020 World Series ended in 6 games, with the Dodgers defeating the Rays.\n- The 2021 World Series also ended in 6 games, with the Braves defeating the Astros.\n- The 2022 World Series again ended in 6 games, with the Astros defeating the Phillies.\n\nHowever, this does not establish a long-term trend, as the length of the World Series can vary significantly from year to year. For example, the 2017 and 2019 World Series both went to 7 games.\n\nTherefore, while there have been instances of the World Series ending in 6 games in recent years, it is not clear that this is more frequent than other lengths overall.\n\n**UNCLEAR**", "comment": "(a) **The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nApproximately 10 to 14 days. The 2024 World Series is scheduled to begin on October 25, 2024, and could conclude anywhere between October 29 and November 2, depending on the number of games played (minimum of 4 games and a maximum of 7 games).\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, meaning all current conditions and team statuses remain the same, the outcome is uncertain. However, based on the Los Angeles Dodgers having home-field advantage and slightly better season performance, they are marginally favored to win the series. The probability that the Yankees lose the World Series in exactly 6 games is low.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nMy forecast would remain largely the same. With only a quarter of the time left (approximately 2-3 days before the series begins), there would be minimal changes impacting the teams' statuses or the series outcome, barring any last-minute injuries or unforeseen events.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were four times the time left (approximately 40 days), my forecast might slightly adjust to account for potential changes such as player recoveries from injuries, changes in team dynamics, or other factors that could arise over a longer period. However, given that both teams have secured their spots in the World Series, the core probabilities would remain similar unless significant events occurred.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nTo estimate the probability that the New York Yankees will lose the 2024 World Series in exactly 6 games, I considered the following factors:\n\n1. **Team Strengths and Performance:**\n   - The Los Angeles Dodgers have home-field advantage due to a better regular-season record (98-64) compared to the Yankees' (94-68).\n   - Both teams have strong lineups with key players, but the Dodgers may have a slight edge due to their depth and recent performance.\n\n2. **Historical Outcomes:**\n   - The World Series can last between 4 to 7 games. Historically, the distribution of series lengths is approximately:\n     - 4-game series: ~13%\n     - 5-game series: ~24%\n     - 6-game series: ~24%\n     - 7-game series: ~39%\n   - Therefore, there's about a 24% base rate that any World Series ends in exactly 6 games.\n\n3. **Probability Calculations:**\n   - Assuming the Dodgers have a **55% chance** of winning any given game (due to home-field advantage and team strength) and the Yankees have a **45% chance**.\n   - The probability that the Dodgers win the series in exactly 6 games can be calculated using binomial probabilities:\n     - \\( P(\\text{Dodgers win in exactly 6 games}) = \\binom{5}{3} \\times (0.55)^4 \\times (0.45)^2 = 10 \\times 0.0915 \\times 0.2025 \\approx 18.5\\% \\)\n   - Therefore, there's approximately an **18.5% chance** that the Yankees lose the World Series in exactly 6 games.\n\n4. **Injuries and Player Availability:**\n   - The Yankees have some key injuries that could impact their performance, such as Nestor Cortes and DJ LeMahieu, which might slightly increase the likelihood of them losing the series.\n\n5. **Expert Predictions:**\n   - There are no specific expert predictions indicating that the Yankees will lose in exactly 6 games.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the above factors, especially the calculated probability and current team conditions, I estimate the probability at approximately **18.5%** that the New York Yankees will lose the 2024 World Series in exactly 6 games.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 18.5%**", "probability": 5}
