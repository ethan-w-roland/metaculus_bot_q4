    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Arkansas have 1 million or more residents living in drought on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-14\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/arkansas) lists greater than or equal to 1 million Arkansas residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after December 31, 2024. If the number is below 1 million, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Drought conditions impact Little Rock businesses, locals](https://www.kark.com/news/local-news/drought-conditions-impact-little-rock-businesses-locals/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Arkansas will have 1 million or more residents living in drought conditions by December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Population of Arkansas\nAs of the latest data, Arkansas has a population of approximately 3.045 million people as of 2022[4][5].\n- This number is expected to grow, but it is already above the 3 million mark.\n\n## Drought Conditions\nDrought conditions can vary widely and are influenced by numerous factors including climate, weather patterns, and seasonal changes. However, the query does not provide specific data on the current or projected drought conditions in Arkansas.\n\n## Historical and Projected Population Growth\n- Arkansas has seen steady population growth, with the population increasing by 22,095 from 2022 to 2023[4].\n- However, this growth does not directly correlate with drought conditions.\n\n## Regional Variations\n- Drought conditions can affect different regions of Arkansas differently. For example, Northwest Arkansas, which is experiencing significant population growth, may have different drought conditions compared to other parts of the state[1][4].\n\n### Key Points for Superforecasters\n- **Base Rate**: There is no historical data provided to establish a base rate for the number of residents living in drought conditions.\n- **Time to Resolution**: Drought conditions can change rapidly due to weather events, making long-term predictions challenging.\n- **Current State**: Without current or near-future drought forecasts, it is difficult to predict the exact number of residents who will be living in drought conditions.\n- **Reference Classes**: Other regions or states with similar climate profiles might offer some insights, but specific data for Arkansas would be necessary for a precise prediction.\n\nGiven the lack of specific data on drought conditions and their impact on the population, it is not possible to clearly answer the question as yes or no based on the available information. Superforecasters would need more detailed and up-to-date information on drought forecasts and their geographical impact within Arkansas to make an informed prediction.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Arkansas currently experiencing drought conditions affecting 1 million or more residents?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is clear that Arkansas is experiencing drought conditions, but the specific number of residents affected is not explicitly stated in the sources.\n\n- The NWS Little Rock report mentions that a moderate to extreme drought (D1 to D3) is ongoing in southern, central, and western Arkansas, and that burn bans were posted in 54 of the 75 counties, indicating widespread drought conditions[1].\n- The Drought Monitor summary also indicates that Arkansas is experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions in various areas[3][4].\n\nHowever, none of the sources provide the exact number of residents affected by these drought conditions. Therefore, it is unclear whether 1 million or more residents are affected.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are surrounding states experiencing drought conditions that could impact Arkansas?\nANSWER: Yes, surrounding states are experiencing drought conditions that could potentially impact Arkansas.\n\n- Oklahoma has been experiencing moderate or worse drought for a record 271 weeks, starting from July 30, 2019, which is likely to have regional implications[4].\n- Texas also set a new drought duration record, with at least part of the state experiencing moderate or worse drought for 280 weeks, beginning on May 28, 2019. This prolonged drought in Texas could affect the broader regional climate and water resources[4].\n- The Midwest, including parts of the Ohio Valley, is experiencing moderate to severe drought, which could influence weather patterns and water availability in the region, including Arkansas[4].\n\nThese drought conditions in neighboring states can contribute to the overall dryness and worsening drought situation in Arkansas.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do long-term weather forecasts predict continued dry conditions in Arkansas through the end of 2024?\nANSWER: No, long-term weather forecasts do not predict continued dry conditions in Arkansas through the end of 2024. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- The Arkansas Storm Team's winter outlook predicts a wet and snowy winter for central Arkansas, with above-average precipitation expected[1].\n- The National Weather Service (NWS) forecast for Little Rock, AR, indicates a wetter than normal winter, especially in the southern sections of the state, with big slugs of moisture expected[4].\n- The Old Farmers' Almanac also forecasts a winter with slightly above-average rainfall for Arkansas[2].\n\nThese forecasts all suggest that Arkansas is expected to experience above-average precipitation, rather than dry conditions, through the end of 2024. \n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an active El Niño or La Niña event expected to influence Arkansas's weather negatively in late 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no active El Niño event expected to influence the weather in late 2024. The El Niño event that was present earlier in 2024 is expected to have diminished by then[5].\n\nHowever, there is a significant likelihood of a La Niña event emerging in late 2024. Forecasters predict a 57-71% chance of La Niña developing in September-November 2024 and persisting through January-March 2025[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the expected climate pattern that could influence Arkansas's weather in late 2024 is a weak La Niña event, rather than an El Niño event.\n\n**YES** (for La Niña)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has December historically seen significant drought conditions in Arkansas affecting at least 1 million residents?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence of significant drought conditions in Arkansas during various periods, but specific details about the population affected in December are not explicitly mentioned.\n\n- The 2005 drought report indicates that Arkansas experienced record dry conditions for several seasons, including December, and it was the second driest year overall. However, it does not specify the number of residents affected[5].\n- The 1930-1931 drought was severe and affected the entire state, but it does not provide a specific population figure for December[3].\n- The 2012 drought details are also severe but do not focus on December specifically[2].\n\nGiven the lack of specific information about the population affected in December, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent climate reports indicated an increased risk of drought in Arkansas by the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, recent climate reports have indicated an increased risk of drought in Arkansas by the end of 2024.\n\n- Reports from the National Weather Service and drought updates highlight that Arkansas, particularly the southern, central, and western parts, are experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions. The forecasts suggest that these conditions are likely to worsen due to the absence of significant precipitation and the anticipated development of a La Niña pattern, which tends to bring warmer and drier conditions to the region[1][3].\n\n- The updates also mention that the current dry scenario, combined with factors such as powdery soil, stressed vegetation, and low streamflow/groundwater, may lead to rapid onset drought in southern and western Arkansas[3].\n\n- These conditions are expected to continue through the end of the year, contributing to an increased risk of drought in the state[1][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Arkansas government currently implementing drought mitigation strategies due to existing dry conditions?\nANSWER: Yes, the Arkansas government is currently involved in efforts that include drought mitigation strategies, particularly in the context of the existing dry conditions.\n\n- The Arkansas Department of Agriculture, under Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ Executive Order 23-27, is updating the Arkansas Water Plan, which includes goals such as reducing the impacts of future flooding events and maintaining water quality. These efforts are part of a broader strategy to manage water resources, which would also address drought conditions[1].\n\n- The state is also engaged in activities to manage and mitigate the effects of drought, as evidenced by the involvement of various agencies and programs. For example, the University of Arkansas System's Division of Agriculture provides research and extension services to help farmers and ranchers deal with drought[2].\n\n- Additionally, the current drought conditions in Arkansas are being closely monitored, and there are ongoing efforts to prepare for and mitigate the effects of drought, including burn bans and wildfire danger assessments by the Arkansas Forestry Division[4].\n\nThese activities indicate that the Arkansas government is actively implementing and planning drought mitigation strategies.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Arkansas experienced below-average precipitation in the past three months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer to whether Arkansas has experienced below-average precipitation in the past three months is not uniformly clear across all sources, but here are some insights:\n\n- In March 2024, precipitation was mixed across the Southern Region, including Arkansas. While some areas received above-average precipitation, others experienced below-normal precipitation[2].\n- From the beginning of August to late October, southern, central, and western Arkansas faced significant rainfall deficits, indicating below-average precipitation during those months[3].\n- However, the recent update from the U.S. Drought Monitor indicates that many areas in Arkansas received significant precipitation in the week leading up to November 2024, which improved drought conditions in some parts of the state[1].\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that Arkansas experienced below-average precipitation in some periods within the last few months, but the situation has varied and improved in recent weeks.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR** (as it depends on the specific time frame within the past three months).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Arkansas entering a season that is typically dry between now and December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is clear that Arkansas is already experiencing dry conditions, but whether this is typical for the season from now until December 31, 2024, can be clarified as follows:\n\n- Historically, September and October are known to be dry months in Arkansas, which is consistent with the current conditions described in the sources[2][4][5].\n- However, the sources also indicate that the current dryness is more severe than usual, with extreme drought conditions in some areas and a high level of wildfire danger[2][3][5].\n- The forecast suggests that the dry conditions are expected to continue, potentially worsening due to the emergence of La Niña, which could lead to further dryness and drought, especially in southern and western Arkansas[5].\n\nGiven this information, while it is typical for Arkansas to experience some dryness in the fall, the current and forecasted conditions are more severe than usual. Therefore, the answer to whether Arkansas is entering a season that is typically dry between now and December 31, 2024, is:\n\n**YES**, but with the caveat that the current dryness is more extreme than what is typically expected.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major water bodies in Arkansas currently at lower than average levels indicating potential drought?\nANSWER: To determine if major water bodies in Arkansas are currently at lower than average levels, indicating potential drought, we need to examine the recent data from various sources.\n\n## Lake Levels\n- The data from November 14, 2024, shows that several lakes in Arkansas are below their full pool levels. For example, Beaver Lake is at 1,116.80 feet, which is 4.20 feet below its full pool of 1,121.00 feet. Similarly, Greers Ferry Lake is at 454.84 feet, 6.60 feet below its full pool of 461.44 feet[1].\n\n## River Levels\n- The Mulberry River, as of November 11, 2024, had a water level of 3.6 feet, which is within the range considered \"Prime white water\" but not indicative of drought. However, this level can fluctuate significantly, and previous readings show periods of very low water levels[3].\n- The Buffalo National River levels are described as \"Very Low\" in some areas, such as Boxley, with a reading of 0.0 feet as of November 14, 2024. This suggests that some river sections are indeed at lower than average levels[4].\n\n## Arkansas River\n- The Arkansas River at Little Rock had a gage height of 7.42 feet on November 12, 2024. While this data point alone does not provide a long-term average for comparison, it is important to note that river levels can vary widely and may not always indicate drought conditions without historical context[5].\n\nGiven these observations:\n- Some lakes are below their full pool levels.\n- Certain river sections, like the Buffalo National River, are at very low levels.\n- Other river sections, like the Mulberry River, have fluctuating levels but were not consistently low as of the recent dates.\n\nTherefore, while there is evidence of some water bodies being at lower than average levels, it is not conclusive across all major water bodies to definitively indicate a state of drought.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately **47 days** remain until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If current conditions persisted unchanged, the outcome would likely be **No**—fewer than 1 million Arkansas residents would be living in drought conditions on December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 12 days):** I would forecast a **15% probability** that 1 million or more residents would be living in drought conditions.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left (approximately 188 days):** I would forecast a **25% probability** that 1 million or more residents would be living in drought conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Drought Conditions:** As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Arkansas was experiencing moderate to severe drought conditions in certain areas. However, there was no clear indication that these conditions affected 1 million or more residents. Arkansas has a population of approximately 3 million, so for 1 million residents to be affected, drought conditions would need to impact about one-third of the state's population.\n\n- **Seasonal Precipitation Trends:** Historically, Arkansas enters a wetter season during the winter months (December to February). Increased precipitation during this period typically alleviates drought conditions rather than exacerbates them.\n\n- **Climate Forecasts:**\n  - **El Niño/La Niña Influence:** Forecasts suggest a likelihood of El Niño conditions persisting into the winter of 2024-2025. El Niño tends to bring wetter-than-average conditions to the southern United States, including Arkansas.\n  - **Predictive Models:** Long-range weather models predict above-average precipitation for Arkansas during the winter months, which would reduce the extent and severity of drought conditions.\n\n- **Short-Term Outlook (47 days):** With less than two months until December 31, significant worsening of drought conditions is less likely, especially given the expected increase in precipitation.\n\n- **Time Frame Adjustments:**\n  - **Quarter of the Time Left (12 days):** With only 12 days remaining, the probability of a dramatic shift leading to widespread drought affecting over 1 million residents is even lower.\n  - **Four Times the Time Left (188 days):** Extending the time frame increases uncertainty. As Arkansas moves into the spring and summer months, there is a higher risk of drought development due to higher temperatures and potential precipitation deficits, slightly increasing the probability.\n\n- **Uncertainties and Risks:**\n  - **Climate Variability:** While forecasts predict wetter conditions, climate variability and unexpected weather patterns (such as blocking highs that prevent precipitation) could alter this outlook.\n  - **Historical Drought Events:** Severe droughts have occurred in Arkansas's history, but they are relatively infrequent during the winter months.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the current conditions, seasonal forecasts, and historical climate patterns, it is unlikely that 1 million or more residents in Arkansas will be living in drought conditions on December 31, 2024. The probability remains low but not negligible due to inherent uncertainties in weather and climate forecasting.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**",
