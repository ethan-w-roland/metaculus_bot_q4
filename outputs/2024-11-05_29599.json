    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Noodles & Co. file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Noodles & Company files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before January 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nNoodles & Company, a fast-casual diner founded in 1995, has faced years of negative net income since the pandemic (except for a small profit in 2021), and faces increased debt and interest expenses. The company has recently been [reported](https://www.nrn.com/fast-casual/noodles-company-considers-closing-around-20-underperforming-units) to be evaluating its restaurants and closing certain underperforming locations.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Noodles & Company filing for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Recent Financial Performance and Challenges\n- Noodles & Company has been facing significant financial challenges, including declining customer traffic and financial woes. The company reported a net loss of $13.8 million in the second quarter of 2024, despite a slight increase in same-store sales and revenue.\n- The company has identified 20 underperforming restaurants that collectively account for a $2 million annual operating loss, and plans to close 10-15 of these locations before the end of the year.\n\n## Historical Context\n- In 2020, Noodles & Company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its inability to find a buyer. However, this does not necessarily predict future bankruptcy filings.\n\n## Current Strategies and Initiatives\n- The company is undergoing a turnaround effort, which includes menu transformation, operational improvements, leveraging digital strength, increasing catering business, and strengthening the financial foundation. These efforts aim to improve profitability and guest satisfaction.\n- Noodles & Company has also implemented cost-cutting measures, such as reducing headcount, adjusting employee benefits, and optimizing supply chain management, which are expected to save over $5 million this year.\n\n## Financial Health and Outlook\n- While the company is taking steps to improve its financial health, the current operating environment remains challenging. The expectation is for same-store sales to be between 0% and -2% for the year, indicating ongoing struggles.\n\nGiven these points, while Noodles & Company is facing significant challenges and has a history of bankruptcy, there is no clear indication from the current information that they will necessarily file for bankruptcy again before January 1, 2025. The company's ongoing efforts to revamp operations and improve financial performance suggest they are working to avoid such an outcome.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The restaurant industry has seen several chains facing financial difficulties and closures in 2024, but this does not directly predict Noodles & Company's specific actions.\n- Historical bankruptcy rates in the restaurant industry, especially during economic downturns or pandemics, can provide context but do not guarantee a repeat scenario.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The timing of potential restaurant closures and the impact of current strategies on financial health will be crucial in determining the company's future financial stability.\n\nIn summary, while there are indicators of financial strain, the question of whether Noodles & Company will file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, cannot be answered with certainty based on the available information. The outcome depends on the success of their current turnaround efforts and the broader economic and industry conditions.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any public statements from Noodles & Company's leadership indicating consideration of filing for bankruptcy?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no public statements from Noodles & Company's leadership indicating consideration of filing for bankruptcy. The sources discuss various challenges the company is facing, such as sales declines, layoffs, and operational adjustments, but they do not mention any consideration of bankruptcy.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Noodles & Company announced plans to close additional underperforming restaurants beyond the initial 20 identified?\nANSWER: No, Noodles & Company has not announced plans to close additional underperforming restaurants beyond the initial 20 identified. The sources consistently mention that the company has identified approximately 20 underperforming locations and plans to close 10 to 15 of these by the end of the year, but there is no indication of plans to close more beyond this initial group.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major investors or stakeholders withdrawn support or funding from Noodles & Company recently?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that major investors or stakeholders have withdrawn support or funding from Noodles & Company recently. The sources discuss financial results, franchise fees, and other business activities, but they do not mention any withdrawal of support or funding from investors or stakeholders.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have credit rating agencies recently downgraded Noodles & Company's credit rating to a level indicating high risk?\nANSWER: YES\n\nCredit rating agencies have recently downgraded Noodles & Company's credit rating. As of September 23, 2024, Noodles & Company experienced a credit rating downgrade, which is indicative of a higher risk profile similar to other restaurant chains facing financial challenges.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Noodles & Company defaulted on any of its debt obligations in the past year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Noodles & Company has defaulted on any of its debt obligations in the past year.\n\n- The latest financial reports and balance sheet data do not mention any defaults on debt obligations.\n- The company has been managing its debt and is in compliance with its debt covenants as of the latest reports.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Noodles & Company reported significant net losses in its most recent financial statements?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nIn the most recent financial statements, Noodles & Company has reported significant net losses. For the first quarter of 2024, the company reported a net loss of $6.1 million, or $0.14 loss per diluted share.\n\nAdditionally, the company's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023 also showed net losses. For the fourth quarter of 2023, the net loss was $6.1 million, and for the full year 2023, the net loss was $9.9 million.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: I believe there may be an error in the background provided. As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Noodles & Company did not file for bankruptcy in 2020 or at any time. Please verify this information with reliable sources.\nANSWER: Based on the reliable sources provided, there is no evidence to suggest that Noodles & Company filed for bankruptcy in 2020 or at any other time.\n\n- The sources from NRN, Wikipedia, and Restaurant Business Online do not mention Noodles & Company filing for bankruptcy.\n- The only source that mentions bankruptcy is from The FW, but it appears to be an error or misinformation as it is not supported by the other reliable sources.\n\nTherefore, the information that Noodles & Company filed for bankruptcy in 2020 is incorrect.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the fast-casual dining industry experiencing a downturn that is adversely affecting companies like Noodles & Company?\nANSWER: The impact on the fast-casual dining industry is mixed, and it does not uniformly affect all companies within the sector.\n\nWhile some fast-casual chains are indeed experiencing a downturn due to consumer pressures, rising labor costs, and an increase in consumers choosing to eat at home, others are bucking this trend. Chains like Chipotle, Wingstop, and Sweetgreen have reported robust sales growth, attributing their success to factors such as a strong value proposition, higher-income customer bases, and effective brand strategies.\n\nSince the sources do not specifically mention Noodles & Company, it is unclear how this particular company is being affected by the current trends in the fast-casual dining industry.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have financial analysts predicted a high likelihood of Noodles & Company filing for bankruptcy in the near future?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the likelihood of Noodles & Company filing for bankruptcy in the near future is indicated as a significant risk, but not necessarily a certainty.\n\n- The company has a Probability of Bankruptcy of 37.0% to 38.0%, which is higher than the average for the Consumer Discretionary industry and the overall market.\n- The Altman Z-Score, which is a measure of bankruptcy risk, is 0.83, which is under 3 and suggests an increased risk of bankruptcy.\n- Despite these indicators, the company is still operational and implementing various strategies to improve its financial performance, such as closing underperforming locations, enhancing digital traffic, and introducing new menu items.\n\nTherefore, while there is a notable risk of financial distress, it is not a definitive prediction that the company will file for bankruptcy in the near future.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Noodles & Company experienced a significant decrease in same-store sales in recent quarters?\nANSWER: Yes, Noodles & Company has experienced significant decreases in same-store sales in recent quarters.\n\n- In the first quarter of 2024, same-store sales declined by 5.4% systemwide, with traffic down by 7.3%.\n- In the second quarter of 2023, same-store sales decreased by 5.5%, with traffic falling by 9.1%.\n- For the third quarter of 2023, same-store sales were down by 3.7%, including a 4.3% decrease at company-owned restaurants and a 1.2% decrease at franchised restaurants.\n- Despite a temporary improvement in the second quarter of 2024 with a 2% increase in same-store sales, this was largely attributed to the timing of holidays, and the company still anticipates same-store sales to be between 0% and -2% for the year.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Noodles & Company's stock price declined by more than 50% in the past six months?\nANSWER: To determine if Noodles & Company's stock price has declined by more than 50% in the past six months, we need to look at the historical stock prices and the percentage change over this period.\n\nAs of the last close mentioned in the sources, the stock price was around $1.13 to $1.15.\n\n- On June 11, 2024, the stock price was $2.09.\n- As of recent reports, the stock price has dropped to around $1.13 to $1.15.\n\nTo calculate the percentage decline:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage decline} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Old price} - \\text{New price}}{\\text{Old price}} \\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nUsing the prices from June 11, 2024, and the recent price:\n\\[ \\text{Percentage decline} = \\left( \\frac{2.09 - 1.13}{2.09} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 46\\% \\]\n\nHowever, if we consider the year-to-date performance mentioned in one of the sources, the stock has declined by 63.49% year-to-date as of the recent reports.\n\nGiven this information, the stock price has indeed declined significantly, but the specific six-month period from June to November shows a decline of approximately 46%, which is less than 50%. However, considering the year-to-date performance, it is clear that over a slightly longer period, the decline has exceeded 50%.\n\nTherefore, based on the year-to-date performance which includes the six-month period in question:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Here are the subquestions:\nANSWER: To determine if the provided subquestions are well-formulated, we need to evaluate them against the criteria for good subquestions as outlined in the sources.\n\n### Criteria for Good Subquestions\n\n1. **Less Complex than the Main Question**:\n   - Subquestions should be narrower and more specific than the main research question.\n\n2. **Focused on One Type of Research**:\n   - Each subquestion should focus on a single aspect of the research.\n\n3. **Presented in a Logical Order**:\n   - Subquestions should be organized in a logical sequence to help answer the main research question step-by-step.\n\n4. **Open Questions**:\n   - Subquestions should not be answerable with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" and should start with words like \"who,\" \"what,\" \"when,\" \"where,\" \"why,\" or \"how\".\n\n### Example Evaluation\n\nIf you provide specific subquestions, here is how you might evaluate them:\n\n- **Example Subquestion 1**: \"What are the main factors influencing young people’s decisions to engage in the gig economy?\"\n  - This subquestion is focused, open, and relevant to the main research question. It meets the criteria.\n\n- **Example Subquestion 2**: \"Is the gig economy beneficial for young people?\"\n  - This subquestion is too broad and includes a value judgment (\"beneficial\"). It does not meet the criteria of being specific and avoiding value judgments.\n\n### General Guidance\n\nWithout specific subquestions provided in your query, here is a general guideline:\n\n- Ensure each subquestion is narrower and more specific than the main research question.\n- Make sure each subquestion focuses on one aspect of the research.\n- Organize the subquestions in a logical order.\n- Use open-ended questions that cannot be answered with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n\nIf your subquestions adhere to these guidelines, they are likely well-formulated.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the lack of specific subquestions in your query, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nFrom today's date, November 5, 2024, until January 1, 2025, there are 56 days remaining.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf the current conditions persist without significant changes, Noodles & Company would **not** file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025. The company is undertaking measures to improve its financial standing, and there are no indications of immediate bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only a quarter of the remaining time, approximately 14 days left, the likelihood of Noodles & Company filing for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, would be even lower. The process of preparing and filing for bankruptcy typically requires more time, and absent any immediate crisis, the probability decreases.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were four times the remaining time, approximately 224 days (about 7.5 months), extending beyond the current deadline to around mid-June 2025, the probability of bankruptcy would increase. More time allows for potential deterioration of financial conditions or unsuccessful turnaround efforts, raising the likelihood of bankruptcy filing.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nNoodles & Company is experiencing financial challenges, including significant net losses and declining same-store sales. Key points influencing the probability estimate are:\n\n- **Financial Performance:** The company reported a net loss of $13.8 million in Q2 2024 and has faced declining sales and customer traffic in recent quarters.\n\n- **Credit Rating Downgrade:** The company's credit rating has been downgraded, indicating increased risk of financial distress. An Altman Z-Score of 0.83 suggests a higher risk of bankruptcy compared to industry averages.\n\n- **Operational Changes:** Noodles & Company is closing underperforming restaurants and implementing cost-cutting measures expected to save over $5 million this year. These efforts aim to improve profitability and stabilize finances.\n\n- **No Immediate Bankruptcy Indicators:** There are no public statements from leadership about considering bankruptcy, no defaults on debt obligations, and no significant investor withdrawals. The lack of immediate red flags reduces the short-term bankruptcy risk.\n\n- **Industry Context:** While the fast-casual dining industry faces challenges, some companies are performing well. The mixed industry performance implies that sector-wide trends do not conclusively predict the company's bankruptcy.\n\n- **Time Frame:** With only 56 days until January 1, 2025, the window for filing bankruptcy is relatively short. Bankruptcy proceedings are complex and often involve preparatory steps that would likely have surfaced publicly if imminent.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there is an elevated risk of financial distress, the probability of Noodles & Company filing for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, remains relatively low within the given time frame.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
