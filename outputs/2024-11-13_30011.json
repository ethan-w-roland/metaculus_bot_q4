    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill China's youth unemployment rate be less than or equal to 17.0 for November 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-13\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve based on the youth unemployment rate for November 2024, as reported by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/youth-unemployment-rate), using data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\nThe question will resolve based on the reported youth unemployment rate, rounded to the nearest 0.1 percentage point.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe youth unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force aged 16-24 without work but available for and seeking employment, based on the calculation method used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China as of August 2024.\n\nIf the National Bureau of Statistics of China revises its calculation method or age range for the youth unemployment rate before September 2024, the question will be resolved using the most up-to-date definition and methodology.\n\nIn the event that Trading Economics does not report the youth unemployment rate for August 2024 before October 7, 2024, or if the data is not available from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the question will resolve as \"Annulled\". The data can be found [directly from the NBS here](https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=A01) by selecting \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate\" under \"Indicators\" on the left side and observing the data in the row labeled \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate of the Population Aged from 16 to 24 Excluding Students(%)\".\n\nBACKGROUND:\nChina's youth unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people aged 16 to 24 who are not in school and are unemployed, has been a growing concern for the country's policymakers and economists. In July 2024, the rate [soared to 17.1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/chinas-youth-unemployment-soars-above-17percent-in-july.html), the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December 2023.\n\nThe new calculation method, introduced in late 2023, excludes those who are still in school, as more people in China are pursuing higher education amid a more competitive job market. Under the previous calculation method, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023.\n\nThe rising youth unemployment rate has been attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes in the labor market. As the issue continues to draw attention, this question aims to predict the youth unemployment rate for August 2024, providing insight into the short-term trajectory of this critical economic indicator.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of China's youth unemployment rate being less than or equal to 17.0% for November 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends\n- The youth unemployment rate in China was 18.8% in August 2024, which was the highest level since the new record-keeping system began in December 2023. However, it decreased to 17.6% in September 2024[2][4][5].\n\n## Historical Context\n- The youth unemployment rate has been volatile, reaching a record high of 21.3% in June 2023 before the data collection method was adjusted to exclude students. This adjustment brought the rate down to 14.9% in December 2023[3][4][5].\n\n## Economic Conditions\n- China's economy is experiencing significant challenges, including a real estate downturn, reduced consumer and employer confidence, and contractions in high-value city service sectors such as real estate, finance, and IT. These factors contribute to the high youth unemployment rate[3][4].\n\n## Seasonal Factors\n- Youth unemployment tends to rise every summer as students transition into the job market. However, the current economic slowdown has exacerbated this seasonal trend[3].\n\n## Projections and Analyst Expectations\n- Trading Economics global macro models and analysts' expectations suggest that the youth unemployment rate in China is projected to be around 18.0% by the end of the current quarter and to trend around 18.5% in 2025 and 18.0% in 2026[2].\n\nGiven these points, while the rate did dip to 17.6% in September, the overall trend and projections suggest that it may remain above 17.0% for November 2024. However, the exact figure for November is not yet available, and the rate can be influenced by various economic and policy factors.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is possible for the rate to be less than or equal to 17.0%, the current trends and projections do not strongly support this outcome. The answer to whether the rate will be less than or equal to 17.0% for November 2024 is not immediately clear and would depend on future economic conditions and policy interventions.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did China's youth unemployment rate fall below 17.0% in October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data for the youth unemployment rate in October 2024. The latest data available is for September 2024, where the youth unemployment rate was 17.6%[1][2][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has consumer confidence in China increased since September 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, consumer confidence in China has not increased since September 2024. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The consumer confidence index in China was at 85.8 points in August 2024 and decreased to 85.7 points in September 2024[3].\n- There is no indication in the sources that the consumer confidence index has increased since September 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the National Bureau of Statistics of China released any preliminary data suggesting a lower youth unemployment rate for November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of preliminary data or any specific figures for the youth unemployment rate in November 2024. The latest data discussed in the sources is for September 2024, and there is no indication of data release for November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China's youth unemployment rate decreased in the months leading up to November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, China's youth unemployment rate has decreased in the months leading up to November 2024.\n\n- In August 2024, the youth unemployment rate was 18.8%[2][3][5].\n- By September 2024, it decreased to 17.6%[1][4][5].\n\nThis indicates a decline in the youth unemployment rate from August to September 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did international organizations predict a decrease in China's youth unemployment rate for the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that international organizations predicted a decrease in China's youth unemployment rate for the end of 2024. The sources discuss the current and recent trends in China's youth unemployment, which have been increasing, and the challenges facing the job market, but they do not mention any predictions from international organizations regarding a decrease in the youth unemployment rate by the end of 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there seasonal trends that typically lower youth unemployment rates in China during November?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication that youth unemployment rates in China typically lower during November due to seasonal trends.\n\n- The sources highlight that youth unemployment rates tend to rise every summer as students transition into the job market, but they do not specify any seasonal trends that would lower these rates in November[2][5].\n- The data provided shows fluctuations in youth unemployment rates, particularly around graduation seasons, but does not mention any specific improvements in November[2][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the real estate market in China showing signs of recovery as of November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 2024, the real estate market in China is showing signs of recovery. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The Chinese government has introduced several policy changes starting in late September to stabilize the economy and the housing market, which have led to an increase in property transactions in major cities like Shanghai, Beijing, and Shenzhen[3][4].\n- Transactions in the secondary market in Shanghai have seen a significant month-on-month jump, and similar trends are observed in Beijing and Shenzhen[3].\n- The government has implemented measures such as reducing minimum mortgage rates, lowering down payment thresholds, and setting up a facility to support affordable housing, all of which are aimed at boosting the real estate sector[1].\n- These policy changes have resulted in increased buyer activity and a surge in property deals, indicating a broader recovery in Chinaâ€™s housing market[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Chinese government implemented new policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment since September 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the most recent information available is up to September 2024, but it does not specify new policies implemented after this date. However, the sources do detail several policies and measures that were implemented or announced prior to and around this time.\n\n- Policies introduced in mid-2023 included special allowances for employers hiring young graduates and a 100-day campaign to find jobs for college graduates[2].\n- In 2024, the government continued with various measures such as subsidized employment, skills development, and labor market policies[3].\n- A significant policy package was announced in September 2024, which includes a 24-point plan to promote high-quality and full employment, involving changes in university programs, vocational training, and job creation priorities[5].\n\nSince there is no information provided about new policies specifically implemented after September 2024, the answer to whether the Chinese government has implemented new policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment since September 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did major Chinese industries announce large-scale hiring initiatives for young workers in late 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence of significant hiring initiatives and employment support for young workers, although the specific timing of \"late 2024\" is not explicitly mentioned.\n\n- China has unveiled robust initiatives, including subsidies for companies hiring college graduates and a scheme to create at least 1 million internship positions annually by the end of 2025, which was announced in the middle of June 2024[3].\n- The Ministry of Education conducted a '100-day sprint' initiative in May 2024 to enhance employment opportunities for graduates, resulting in nearly 3.76 million new employment positions[3].\n- The government has organized numerous recruitment events and job fairs, offering over 43 million jobs during a three-month spring campaign, and allocated a significant budget to support job creation and entrepreneurship initiatives[5].\n\nWhile these initiatives were announced and implemented around the first half of 2024, they indicate a strong commitment to hiring and supporting young workers, which is likely to continue. However, the sources do not specifically mention large-scale hiring initiatives announced in \"late 2024.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as the sources do not provide explicit information about late 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been significant improvements in China's economic indicators in recent months?\nANSWER: The recent months have seen some mixed and limited improvements in China's economic indicators, but overall, the picture remains cautious.\n\n- China's GDP growth did decelerate to 4.6% in Q3 2024 from 4.7% in Q2, primarily due to weakness in aggregate demand, the property downturn, and restrained private consumption[1][3][5].\n- There was an acceleration in production and consumption data in September, driven by fiscal stimulus and supportive measures like consumer trade-in and equipment upgrading programs[1].\n- Retail sales growth improved to 3.2% in September from 2.1% in August, driven by increased sales of durable goods[1].\n- The unemployment rate fell slightly to 5.1% in September from 5.3% in August[3].\n- Monetary policy easing measures, including cuts in policy rates and reserve requirement ratios, were implemented to support growth[3].\n\nHowever, despite these measures, several challenges persist:\n- Weakness in domestic demand and consumer confidence remains a significant issue[1][3][5].\n- The property market continues to contract, and infrastructure investment has moderated[1][2].\n- Core inflation is low, and producer prices have been declining, indicating ongoing economic imbalances[3].\n\nTherefore, while there have been some minor improvements, the overall economic indicators suggest that significant structural issues still need to be addressed for sustained growth.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as the improvements are limited and do not indicate a broad or significant turnaround in all economic indicators).",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nApproximately **one month** remains until the youth unemployment rate for **November 2024** is released, likely in **mid-December 2024**.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends persist without significant changes, the youth unemployment rate would likely continue its gradual decline but may **remain slightly above 17.0%**, considering it was **17.6% in September 2024**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith less time remaining and minimal changes expected, I would forecast the rate to be around **17.2%**, which is **slightly above 17.0%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith more time for economic policies to take effect and positive trends to continue, I would anticipate a higher likelihood of the rate falling **below 17.0%**, possibly reaching **16.5%** or lower.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nChina's youth unemployment rate has shown a **positive downward trend** in recent months:\n\n- **August 2024**: **18.8%**\n- **September 2024**: **17.6%**\n\nThis significant decrease of **1.2 percentage points** suggests that government interventions and seasonal adjustments (as new graduates find employment) are having an impact.\n\n**Key Factors Influencing the Forecast:**\n\n1. **Government Policies:**\n\n   - **Economic Stimulus Measures**: The Chinese government has implemented policies to stabilize the economy and boost employment, including:\n\n     - Reducing minimum mortgage rates and lowering down payment thresholds to stimulate the real estate market [3][4].\n     - Subsidies for companies hiring college graduates and creating internship positions [3][5].\n     - A 24-point plan to promote high-quality and full employment, focusing on job creation and skills development [5].\n\n   - These initiatives are expected to **improve labor market conditions** and reduce youth unemployment.\n\n2. **Economic Conditions:**\n\n   - **Real Estate Market Recovery**: Signs of recovery in the real estate sector are evident, with increased property transactions in major cities [3][4]. A healthier real estate market can lead to job creation in construction and related industries.\n\n   - **Industrial Production and Retail Sales**: There has been an acceleration in production and consumption data in September 2024, driven by fiscal stimulus [1]. Retail sales growth improved to **3.2%** in September from **2.1%** in August [1].\n\n3. **Seasonal Factors:**\n\n   - After the summer graduation season, where youth unemployment typically peaks, the rate tends to **decline** as graduates secure employment.\n\n4. **Challenges and Uncertainties:**\n\n   - **Consumer Confidence**: Consumer confidence remains low, with the index at **85.7 points in September 2024**, showing no significant improvement since August [3]. Low consumer confidence can dampen economic growth and job creation.\n\n   - **Economic Imbalances**: Despite policy measures, weak domestic demand and cautious business sentiment may limit the pace of unemployment reduction [1][3].\n\n**Calculations and Projections:**\n\n- The youth unemployment rate decreased by **1.2 percentage points** from August to September 2024.\n\n- If this trend continues, with an average monthly decrease of **0.6 percentage points**, we can estimate:\n\n  - **October 2024**: Approximately **17.0%**\n  - **November 2024**: Potentially **16.4%**\n\n- However, the rate of decrease may **slow down** as structural challenges persist.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the recent trends and the impact of government policies, there is a reasonable likelihood that the youth unemployment rate will fall **below or equal to 17.0%** for November 2024. However, lingering economic challenges and uncertainties may prevent a substantial decline.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
