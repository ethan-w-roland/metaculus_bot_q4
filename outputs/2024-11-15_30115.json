    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill North Korea deploy military personnel to Ukraine before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-15\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) report that at least 100 North Korean troops have entered Ukrainian soil before January 1, 2025.\r\n\r\n If no credible reports indicate the simultaneous presence of 100 or more North Korean soldiers in Ukraine, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- Ukrainian soil is defined based on the pre-2014 internationally recognized borders of Ukraine.\r\n- This question pertains only to personnel who have been members of any of the five branches of North Korea's military forces, the Korean People's Army.\r\n- This question will resolve based on the best information available as of January 7, 2025.\r\n- For purposes of this question, troops will count as North Korean military personnel if they are identified as such by credible sources. This is true even in the event of edge cases such as them wearing non-North Korean insignia, being under the command of Russian officers, or being deployed as part of multinational units.  \r\n- Non-combat roles such as logistical support count as well, as long as the North Korean personnel are present on pre-2014 Ukrainian soil.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nNorth Korea and Russia have significantly strenghened their military cooperation since the start of the war in Ukraine. In September 2023, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un [visited Russia](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66810830), meeting with President Vladimir Putin to discuss potential military and economic collaboration. In early November 2024, Ukraine [fought](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c14le0p4310o) North Korean troops for the first time, while [more recent reports](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/11/10/europe/russia-north-korea-forces-prepared-kursk-ukraine/index.html) claim that 10,000 [North Korean troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Army) will join Russian soldiers in an attempt to take back the Ukraine-occupied region of Kursk.\r\n\r\n[Moreover](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/i/151515209/asia)\r\n\r\n> South Korean intelligence reports that an agreement between North Korea and Russia includes an annual supply of 600K to 700K tonnes of rice to North Korea, $200M, space technology, and provisions for Russian involvement in potential conflicts on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n\r\nHowever, until November 12, 2024, there have been no reports of North Korean troops in Ukrainian soil.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of North Korea deploying military personnel to Ukraine before January 1, 2025, here are some key points from the available sources:\n\n## Current Deployment and Plans\n- North Korean troops have already been deployed to Russia, specifically to the Kursk Oblast, to support Russian forces in retaking territory from Ukrainian incursions. This deployment includes between 10,000 to 12,000 North Korean soldiers, with some reports indicating that the first units of North Korean personnel were deployed to Kursk Oblast on October 23[3][4][5].\n\n## Operational Strategy\n- The Kremlin is currently prioritizing the use of North Korean troops in the Kursk region to help regain control of the territory lost to Ukrainian forces. This strategy allows Russia to re-allocate its own troops to other areas of the front in Ukraine[3][4][5].\n\n## Future Deployment to Ukraine\n- It is indicated that North Korean personnel are unlikely to deploy directly into Ukraine until the Kremlin deems that it has properly responded to the Kursk incursion. The primary focus is on maintaining control over the informational effects of using these troops and ensuring they are used effectively within Russian territory before potentially deploying them into Ukraine[3][4].\n\n## Strategic Considerations\n- The deployment of North Korean troops is part of a broader strategic cooperation between Russia and North Korea, which includes mutual defense commitments and potential exchanges of military and economic aid. However, the immediate priority for these troops is the Kursk region rather than direct deployment into Ukraine[1][3][4].\n\nGiven these points, while it is possible that North Korean troops could be deployed to Ukraine in the future, the current strategy and priorities suggest that such a deployment is unlikely before January 1, 2025, unless there is a significant change in the operational situation or strategic considerations.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The base rate for foreign military interventions involving North Korea is relatively low, and their involvement in European conflicts is unprecedented.\n- The reference class of similar military cooperations between Russia and other nations does not provide a clear precedent for immediate deployment into Ukraine.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The decision to deploy North Korean troops into Ukraine would depend on the resolution of the Kursk incursion and other operational priorities set by the Kremlin.\n\nIn summary, while the possibility exists, the current information suggests that a deployment of North Korean troops directly into Ukraine before January 1, 2025, is not imminent based on the prioritization of the Kursk region and the strategic considerations outlined. However, this situation is highly dynamic and subject to change based on various factors.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Russia publicly requested military assistance from North Korea for the conflict in Ukraine?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no explicit statement that Russia has publicly requested military assistance from North Korea for the conflict in Ukraine. The sources do indicate that North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are involved in the conflict, but they do not mention a public request from Russia for this assistance.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has North Korea officially offered military support to Russia in the Ukraine conflict?\nANSWER: Yes, North Korea has officially offered military support to Russia in the Ukraine conflict. This is evident from several sources:\n\n- North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia, specifically to the Kursk Oblast, to support Russian military operations[1][2][5].\n- Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence reports, as well as White House confirmations, have verified the deployment and training of North Korean soldiers in Russia[1][2][5].\n- The cooperation includes not only the deployment of troops but also the supply of munitions from North Korea to Russia, which has been critical to Russia's war effort[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does international law or sanctions prohibit North Korea from deploying troops to Ukraine?\nANSWER: Yes, international law prohibits North Korea from deploying troops to support Russia in the war against Ukraine.\n\nSeveral sources clarify that by sending troops to support Russia, North Korea would be violating several principles of international law:\n- North Korea would be violating the prohibition on the use of force laid down in the United Nations Charter, as Russia's aggression against Ukraine is illegal[5].\n- North Korea would be violating its obligations under the law of neutrality by assisting the aggressor, Russia[5][4].\n- This deployment would also constitute a participation in the international armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, making North Korea a party to the conflict[3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any historical precedent of North Korea deploying military personnel to European conflicts?\nANSWER: There is no historical precedent of North Korea deploying military personnel to European conflicts based on the provided sources. The sources discuss North Korea's involvement in various conflicts, including the Korean War and recent deployments to Russia in support of Russia's war in Ukraine, but they do not mention any deployments to European conflicts other than the current involvement in Ukraine, which is not traditionally considered part of Europe in a historical or geographical sense relevant to the question.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (or more accurately, there is no historical precedent mentioned in the sources provided).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the deployment of foreign troops to Ukraine by countries other than North Korea a common occurrence?\nANSWER: The deployment of foreign troops to Ukraine by countries other than North Korea is not a common occurrence.\n\n- While there have been discussions and considerations about deploying European troops to Ukraine, especially in the context of recent developments such as the potential deployment of North Korean troops, it remains a highly debated and unlikely scenario for most European countries at this time[3].\n- The primary involvement of foreign troops in Ukraine has been limited to training, advising, and mentoring Ukrainian forces, such as the role of the U.S. Florida National Guard, which has since been repositioned out of Ukraine[4].\n- There is no widespread or common deployment of combat troops from other countries to Ukraine.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there credible reports of North Korean troops being prepared for deployment to Ukraine as of October 2023?\nANSWER: YES, there are credible reports of North Korean troops being prepared for deployment to Ukraine as of October 2023.\n\nMultiple sources confirm this development:\n- NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced that North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia, specifically to the Kursk border region, and are preparing for operations alongside Russian forces[1][3][5].\n- U.S. intelligence and the White House have confirmed that thousands of North Korean soldiers have been deployed to Russia, with many undergoing training in preparation for combat in Ukraine[2][4][5].\n- Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence reports also corroborate the deployment and training of North Korean troops in Russia, with plans for their use in the Ukrainian front line[4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of North Korea providing military equipment or ammunition to Russia for use in Ukraine?\nANSWER: Yes, there is evidence that North Korea has been providing military equipment and ammunition to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\n- South Korea’s spy agency reported that North Korea sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles, and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023 to replenish its dwindling weapons stockpiles[3][4].\n- Specifically, it was estimated that North Korea sent about 2,000 containers of military equipment and munitions, containing around 200,000 122mm artillery shells or one million 152mm artillery shells, from North Korea's Raijin Port to Vladivostok between August and November 2023[4].\n- Additionally, there were reports of North Korea making 10 weapons shipments totaling around one million artillery rounds to Russia between August and November 2023[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has North Korea sent military personnel abroad to participate in conflicts since 2000?\nANSWER: Yes, North Korea has sent military personnel abroad to participate in conflicts since 2000, although these deployments have been relatively limited in scale and scope compared to the current deployment in Russia.\n\n- During the Syrian Civil War, North Korean officers may have assisted the Syrian Arab Army in military operations planning and supervised artillery bombardments[3].\n- North Korean militia units were reported to be fighting on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2016[1].\n- Additionally, North Korean instructors have trained fighters in other conflicts, such as training Hezbollah fighters in guerrilla warfare tactics around 2004[3].\n\nHowever, the recent deployment of a large ground force to Russia in support of Russia's war in Ukraine is a significant and historic departure from these previous, more limited deployments[1][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any countries allied with Russia sent military personnel to Ukraine during the conflict?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is evidence suggesting that some countries allied with Russia have been involved in or are planning to be involved in the conflict in Ukraine, although the extent of their direct military personnel deployment is not fully clarified.\n\n- Belarus, Russia's closest ally, has allowed its land and airspace to be used by Russian forces, but there is no explicit mention of Belarusian military personnel being sent to Ukraine[1][5].\n- North Korea is reported to be training thousands of troops in Russia, and there are fears that these troops could soon be deployed in Ukraine, indicating a potential but not yet confirmed deployment of military personnel[5].\n\nTherefore, while there are indications of potential or planned involvement, the sources do not provide definitive proof that military personnel from these countries have already been sent to Ukraine.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have North Korea and Russia engaged in significant military cooperation agreements recently?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nNorth Korea and Russia have recently engaged in significant military cooperation agreements. Here are the key points:\n\n- In June 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a mutual defense treaty during a summit in Pyongyang. This treaty obligates both countries to provide immediate military assistance if either is attacked[2][4][5].\n- The treaty includes provisions for military cooperation, mutual defense, and cooperation in various sectors such as peaceful atomic energy and space programs[2][4][5].\n- North Korea has deployed troops to Russia to support its war in Ukraine, with reports suggesting up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been sent[1][3][4].\n- The agreement has been ratified by both countries, with Russia’s parliament and North Korea’s state authorities approving the treaty[1][4][5].\n\nThese developments indicate a substantial deepening of military cooperation between North Korea and Russia.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately 1.5 months remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) If nothing changes, the outcome would be:**\n\n**No.** Currently, there are no credible reports of North Korean troops entering Ukrainian soil.\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately 11 days left, the likelihood of North Korea deploying troops to Ukraine would be even lower, given the short time frame and lack of current evidence.\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith about 6 months remaining, the probability would increase slightly due to the extended time frame, allowing more opportunity for geopolitical developments. However, it would still remain low due to the factors discussed below.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of **November 15, 2024**, there are no credible reports confirming that North Korea has deployed military personnel to Ukraine. The resolution criteria specify that for the question to resolve as **Yes**, credible sources must report that at least 100 North Korean troops have entered Ukrainian soil before January 1, 2025.\n\n**Current State of Affairs:**\n\n- **Knowledge Cutoff:** My training data only goes up to **October 2023**. As of that time, there were no indications of North Korean troops being deployed to Ukraine.\n- **Recent Developments:** While hypothetical reports suggest North Korean troops are in Russia's Kursk Oblast and may assist Russian forces, there is no verifiable evidence of their presence on Ukrainian soil.\n- **International Relations:** Direct deployment of North Korean troops to Ukraine would represent a significant escalation with potential global ramifications. North Korea has historically been cautious about direct military involvement in conflicts outside the Korean Peninsula.\n\n**Base Rates and Historical Precedent:**\n\n- North Korea has rarely deployed military personnel abroad, particularly in active conflict zones in Europe.\n- There is no historical precedent for North Korean troops fighting in European conflicts.\n- Previous international involvement has been limited to training, advisory roles, or participation in conflicts aligning closely with North Korea's strategic interests.\n\n**Mechanisms Driving the Outcome:**\n\n- **Political Considerations:** North Korea may be reluctant to risk further international sanctions or diplomatic isolation by deploying troops to Ukraine.\n- **Strategic Benefits:** The benefits of deploying troops may not outweigh the potential costs for North Korea.\n- **International Law:** Such an action would violate international law and could trigger responses from other nations, including those allied with Ukraine.\n\n**Time Frame:**\n\n- With only 1.5 months left until the deadline, the window for such a deployment is narrowing.\n- Significant military deployments typically require logistical planning, which would likely produce detectable signs picked up by intelligence sources.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the lack of credible reports, historical precedent, and the short time frame remaining, the probability that North Korea will deploy military personnel to Ukraine before January 1, 2025, is low.\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
