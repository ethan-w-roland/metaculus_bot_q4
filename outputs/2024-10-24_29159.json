{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill at least 200 Benin Bronzes go from the British Museum to Nigeria before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-24\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nResolves as Yes if at least 200 Benin bronzes that were formerly owned by the British Museum physically return to Nigeria before January 1, 2025.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBenin, in present-day Nigeria, was a powerful and wealthy state that had trade relations with the Portuguese since the 15th century. Benin traded ivory, gum, pepper, and cotton cloth for the Portuguese copper, brass, and other metals. In the 17th century, Benin's Oba (king) began raiding and trading for slaves from neighboring kingdoms. Benin became one of the major hubs of the slave trade in West Africa, along with Dahomey and Oyo.\n\nAfter the slave trade was abolished by Britain in 1807, Benin faced several challenges and changes. The British navy tried to suppress the illegal slave trade by patrolling the coast and intercepting slave ships. This disrupted Benin's economy and trade relations with other African states and Europe. Benin also had to deal with internal conflicts and rebellions from some of its vassal states that wanted more autonomy or independence. Benin tried to resist British colonialism by maintaining its sovereignty and culture, but it was eventually defeated by a British punitive expedition in 1897 that sacked and burned the city, looted its treasures and artworks, and deposed its Oba. Benin became part of the British protectorate of Nigeria until it gained its independence in 1960.\n\nThe Benin Bronzes were a collection of brass plaques, sculptures, and other objects looted from Benin. The bronzes are notable for their intricate and detailed designs, which often depict historical events, royal figures, and other aspects of Benin culture and history. The collection is considered to be one of the greatest examples of African art and craftsmanship, and it is highly valued by museums and collectors around the world.\n\n[According to Richard Assheton](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/why-returning-the-benin-bronzes-is-so-complicated-j2m8ffz23),\n\n> Colonial powers initially refused to believe an African civilisation had produced these stunning works. Today, more than 900 lie in the British Museum, and others in museums and private collections all over the world.\n\n> ...\n\n> The British Museum ... has refused [to transfer away ownership of any of the bronzes], saying it is bound by law not to give away its collections.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nThe question of whether at least 200 Benin Bronzes will be returned from the British Museum to Nigeria before January 1, 2025, is complex and influenced by several factors:\n\n## Legal Barriers\nThe British Museum Act of 1963 prohibits the museum from legally transferring ownership of the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. This act allows for loans but not permanent transfers, making it legally challenging for the British Museum to return the bronzes without a change in legislation, which is currently unlikely given the political climate.\n\n## Ongoing Discussions and Requests\nDespite the legal hurdles, there have been ongoing discussions and formal requests from the Nigerian government and the Benin Royal Palace for the return of the Benin Bronzes. In October 2021, the Nigerian Ministry of Information and Culture made a formal request for the return of Nigerian antiquities, including the Benin Bronzes.\n\n## Other Institutions' Actions\nOther institutions, such as the Horniman Museum, Oxford University, and Cambridge University, have already returned or committed to returning Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. However, the British Museum's situation is unique due to its legal constraints.\n\n## Collaborative Projects\nThe British Museum is involved in collaborative projects with Nigerian partners, including the MOWAA Archaeology Project, which aims to enhance understanding of Benin City's heritage. While these projects indicate positive relationships and cooperation, they do not directly address the repatriation of the Benin Bronzes.\n\n## Current Status\nGiven the current legal framework and the lack of recent indications that the British Museum Act of 1963 will be amended, it is unlikely that the British Museum will return at least 200 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria before January 1, 2025. The museum's position remains that it can lend objects but not transfer ownership, and there has been no significant update suggesting a change in this stance.\n\nIn summary, while there is a strong moral and cultural case for the return of the Benin Bronzes, the legal and political barriers make it improbable that at least 200 of these artifacts will be returned from the British Museum to Nigeria before January 1, 2025.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the UK government passed any legislation permitting the British Museum to return the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe British Museum is prohibited from returning the Benin Bronzes due to the constraints imposed by the British Museum Act of 1963. This act does not allow the museum to dispose of its objects, and any return or repatriation would require a change in the law by the UK's parliament, which has not been enacted.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence that the British Museum is preparing to transport at least 200 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: There is no specific evidence in the provided sources that the British Museum is preparing to transport at least 200 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria before January 1, 2025. While the sources do mention discussions, requests, and collaborative efforts regarding the return of the Benin Bronzes, they do not provide a definitive timeline or details about the immediate transportation of a specific number of bronzes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the British Museum returned any Benin Bronzes to Nigeria as of today?\nANSWER: No, the British Museum has not returned any Benin Bronzes to Nigeria as of today. The British Museum is legally prevented from returning the Benin Bronzes under the British Museum Act of 1963 and the Heritage Act of 1983. While the museum is engaged in discussions and collaborations with Nigerian institutions, it has not repatriated any of the Benin Bronzes from its collection.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are at least 200 Benin Bronzes from the British Museum currently in Nigeria?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that while several institutions in the UK and other countries are in the process of returning Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, the British Museum itself has not returned any of its Benin Bronzes due to legal restrictions. The British Museum Act of 1963 prevents the museum from transferring ownership of the bronzes, although it can lend them.\n\nOther institutions, such as the Horniman Museum, Oxford University, and Cambridge University, have initiated or completed the return of some Benin Bronzes, but these do not include the British Museum's collection.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the British Museum announced plans to return at least 200 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe British Museum has not announced plans to return at least 200 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria before January 1, 2025. In fact, the British Museum Act of 1963 prevents the museum from legally transferring ownership of the bronzes, and any return would require an amendment or revision of this act, which is currently unlikely. While the British Museum has expressed willingness to consider the return of some Benin bronzes, no concrete plans for the return of at least 200 bronzes have been announced.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any legal actions compelled the British Museum to return the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria?\nANSWER: No, there have been no legal actions that have compelled the British Museum to return the Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. The British Museum is legally prevented from returning the Benin Bronzes due to the British Museum Act of 1963, which bars the museum's trustees from disposing of any objects in the collection unless they are duplicates, physically unfit to be retained, or useless.\n\nWhile there have been discussions, moral obligations, and some amendments to related laws (such as the Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act of 2009 for Nazi-era looted items), these do not apply to the Benin Bronzes. Other museums in the UK, not bound by the same legislation, have returned or agreed to return their Benin Bronzes, but the British Museum remains constrained by its current legal framework.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the British Museum Act 1963 been amended or repealed to allow the museum to permanently return artifacts?\nANSWER: The British Museum Act 1963 has not been amended or repealed to generally allow the British Museum to permanently return artifacts. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Act strictly prohibits the disposal of objects in the British Museum's collections, except in very limited circumstances.\n- There have been some specific amendments and exceptions, such as those related to the Holocaust (Return of Cultural Objects) Act 2009, which allows for the return of certain objects related to the Nazi era, but these are highly specific and do not constitute a general amendment to allow for the permanent return of artifacts.\n- A proposed amendment, as seen in the British Museum Act 1963 (Amendment) Bill, aims to enable the British Museum to transfer objects to other institutions under certain conditions, but this is not yet enacted and does not reflect current legislation.\n\nTherefore, the current legislation still maintains a strong presumption against the disposal or permanent return of artifacts from the British Museum's collections.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has public pressure led the British Museum to change its policy on returning artifacts to their countries of origin?\nANSWER: The current evidence suggests that public pressure has not yet led to a change in the British Museum's policy on returning artifacts to their countries of origin, although there are ongoing discussions and some potential avenues for change.\n\n- The British Museum is still bound by the British Museum Act of 1963, which prohibits the permanent return of objects in its collection except in very limited circumstances, such as if the object is a duplicate, physically damaged, or no longer of public interest.\n- Despite growing public pressure and numerous requests from various countries, the museum has not altered its core policy. Instead, it has explored alternatives like long-term loans, as seen in the case of the gold pieces returned to Ghana and the proposed loan of the Elgin Marbles to Greece.\n- There is a potential loophole through the Charities Act 2022, which could allow for the return of objects if trustees feel a moral obligation and gain necessary approvals. However, this provision has been delayed by the British government for further consideration.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have other major UK museums returned significant numbers of Benin Bronzes to Nigeria recently?\nANSWER: Yes, other major UK museums have returned or are in the process of returning significant numbers of Benin Bronzes to Nigeria recently.\n\n- The Horniman Museum and Gardens has announced the return of its 72 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria, with some objects already transferred and others to be moved once the necessary arrangements are complete.\n- Jesus College, Cambridge, and the University of Aberdeen have returned specific Benin Bronze objects, such as a bronze statue of a Cockerel and a Head of an Oba, respectively, in February 2022.\n- The Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford is processing a claim for the return of 97 objects and has received support from the University Council for this return, although the process is still pending.\n- Glasgow Life Museums and the University of Cambridge\u2019s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA) are also involved in repatriation programs for Benin Bronzes.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent negotiations between the UK and Nigerian governments resulted in an agreement to return the Benin Bronzes?\nANSWER: Recent negotiations between the UK and Nigerian governments have led to significant progress and commitments towards the return of the Benin Bronzes, but the process is still ongoing and faces some complexities.\n\n- Several UK institutions, including the Pitt Rivers Museum, the University of Cambridge\u2019s Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, Glasgow Life Museums, and the Horniman Museum and Gardens, have announced plans to return their Benin artefacts to Nigeria.\n- There have been actual returns, such as the handover of 22 bronzes by German representatives to the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) in Nigeria, although the German government transferred ownership of a much larger number of bronzes.\n- However, the process has been complicated by a Presidential Declaration in Nigeria recognizing the Oba of Benin as the rightful owner and custodian of the returned artefacts, which has caused confusion among European museums and the NCMM regarding who should be the partner in these negotiations.\n\nIn summary, while there are agreements and actions in place for the return of the Benin Bronzes, the exact details and final arrangements are still being worked out.\n\n**YES**, but with ongoing complexities and negotiations.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of 2024-10-24, there are approximately **68 days** remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and the deadline, the British Museum would not have returned any Benin Bronzes to Nigeria due to the legal constraints imposed by the British Museum Act of 1963. Therefore, **the outcome would be NO**, and the question would resolve as false.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only a quarter of the time left (approximately **17 days**), the probability of at least 200 Benin Bronzes going from the British Museum to Nigeria before the deadline would be **even lower**, approaching zero, given the tight time frame and existing barriers.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were four times the time left (approximately **272 days**), extending the timeline into mid-2025, the probability would increase slightly due to the additional time for potential legislative changes or agreements. However, given the current lack of momentum toward amending the British Museum Act of 1963, the probability would still be **low**, perhaps around **5%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Legal Constraints:** The British Museum Act of 1963 legally prohibits the British Museum from permanently transferring ownership of objects in its collection, including the Benin Bronzes. Any return would require an amendment to this act, which is a complex and time-consuming legislative process.\n  \n- **Lack of Legislative Change:** As of the current date, there have been **no amendments or repeals** of the British Museum Act of 1963 to allow for the return of the Benin Bronzes. There is also no indication that such legislative changes are imminent before January 1, 2025.\n\n- **No Announced Plans:** The British Museum has **not announced any plans** to return at least 200 Benin Bronzes to Nigeria before the deadline. While other institutions have returned bronzes, the British Museum remains constrained by its unique legal situation.\n\n- **Time Frame:** With only 68 days remaining, there is insufficient time for the necessary legal amendments, logistical arrangements, and physical transportation of 200 artifacts.\n\n- **Precedents from Other Institutions:** Other UK institutions, not bound by the same legal restrictions, have successfully returned Benin Bronzes to Nigeria. However, these actions do not impact the British Museum's legal ability to do the same within the specified time frame.\n\n- **Public Pressure and Negotiations:** While public pressure and ongoing negotiations continue, they have **not led to a change** in the British Museum's policies or the relevant legislation up to this point.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 1%**", "probability": 1}
