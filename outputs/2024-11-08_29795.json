    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nOn November 29, 2024, Will Apple have the largest market cap in the world?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-08\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves Yes if, on November 29, 2024, Apple is ranked #1 by market capitalization according to [Companies Market Cap](https://companiesmarketcap.com/), when checked by Metaculus after the close of the day's trading.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of October 5, 2024, Apple was the #1 company in the world by market cap, according to the resolution source.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nAs of the current date, November 8, 2024, the market capitalization rankings among the top tech companies are subject to significant fluctuations, particularly driven by the rapid advancements and investments in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Market Capitalization\nAs of November 5, 2024, Nvidia has surpassed Apple to become the world's largest company by market capitalization, with a market cap of $3.43 trillion compared to Apple's $3.38 trillion.\n\n## Volatility and AI Impact\nThe AI sector is highly volatile, and market capitalization can change rapidly. Nvidia's rise is largely attributed to its dominance in AI-related technologies, and its market value has soared more than 850% since the end of 2022.\n\n## Historical Context\nApple has historically been the largest company by market capitalization but has lost this title briefly in the past. For instance, Nvidia briefly surpassed Apple in June 2024 before Apple regained the top spot, only to lose it again in November 2024.\n\n## Future Projections\nGiven the dynamic nature of the tech industry and the significant impact of AI on market valuations, it is challenging to predict with certainty which company will hold the largest market capitalization on a specific future date like November 29, 2024. Factors such as earnings reports, market sentiment, and technological advancements can all influence these rankings.\n\nIn summary, while Nvidia currently holds the top spot, the question of whether Apple will have the largest market cap on November 29, 2024, cannot be answered definitively based on the available information. The market is highly volatile, and several factors could influence the rankings in the coming weeks.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nvidia's stock price shown significant decline since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about Nvidia's stock price movements since November 5, 2024. The latest updates in the sources are from earlier in 2024, and they do not include data or events occurring after that date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of November 8, 2024, is Nvidia ranked #1 by market capitalization according to Companies Market Cap?\nANSWER: YES, as of November 8, 2024, NVIDIA is ranked #1 by market capitalization according to the data provided by Companies Market Cap. The sources indicate that NVIDIA's market cap is approximately $3.6 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company by market cap at that time.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nvidia experienced any major negative news or setbacks since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any major negative news or setbacks specifically affecting Nvidia since November 5, 2024. The sources discuss Nvidia's strong performance, its inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and its historic market cap, but they do not indicate any significant negative events or setbacks in the specified time frame.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Historically, has Apple quickly regained the #1 market cap position after losing it to another company?\nANSWER: Yes, Apple has quickly regained the #1 market cap position after losing it to another company. As of June 2024, Apple lost the top spot to Microsoft in January but reclaimed it following the announcement of its AI features at its annual developers conference.\n\nIn July 2024, Apple solidified its position as the stock market's most valuable company by exceeding a $3.5 trillion market capitalization, further reinforcing its regained top position. This indicates that Apple was able to regain the #1 market cap position relatively quickly after losing it.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the AI sector expected to experience a downturn before November 29, 2024, potentially impacting Nvidia's market cap?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of an expected downturn in the AI sector before November 29, 2024, that would specifically impact Nvidia's market cap.\n\n- The sources highlight the continuous growth and investment in the AI sector, with projections of significant expansion in the coming years.\n- There is no mention of any imminent downturn or negative forecasts for the AI sector in the near term.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as there is no specific information indicating a downturn before November 29, 2024)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple's stock price shown significant growth since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if Apple's stock price has shown significant growth since November 5, 2024, we can examine the stock prices around that date.\n\nAs of November 5, 2024, the closing price of Apple's stock was $223.45.\n\nBy November 7, 2024, the closing price had risen to $227.48.\n\nThis represents an increase of $4.03, or approximately 1.8%, over the two-day period.\n\nWhile this is a positive change, whether it is considered \"significant\" can be subjective. However, in the context of short-term stock market movements, a nearly 2% increase over two days can be seen as notable.\n\nTherefore, based on the available data, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any regulatory actions or antitrust investigations announced against Nvidia since November 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there have been announcements and ongoing investigations involving Nvidia, but these were reported before November 5, 2024.\n\n- The U.S. Justice Department has been investigating Nvidia for potential antitrust violations, with subpoenas sent out as part of this investigation, which was reported in September 2024.\n- The EU has also been discussing potential regulatory actions due to Nvidia's dominant market position in AI chips, but as of the reports in July 2024, no definitive regulatory action had been taken.\n\nSince there are no reports provided that are dated after November 5, 2024, it is unclear if any new regulatory actions or antitrust investigations have been announced specifically since that date.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple released a strong earnings report for Q4 2024 exceeding market expectations?\nANSWER: Apple's Q4 2024 earnings report shows mixed results in relation to market expectations:\n\n- Apple posted a record September quarter revenue of $94.9 billion, which is up 6% year-over-year, exceeding the anticipated revenue of $94.59 billion.\n- However, the net quarterly profit was $14.7 billion, or $0.97 per diluted share, which was impacted by a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion. Without this charge, the earnings per share would have been $1.64, up 12% year-over-year.\n- This adjusted earnings per share of $1.64 is higher than the anticipated $1.48, but the actual reported earnings per share of $0.97 fell short of expectations due to the one-time tax charge.\n\nTherefore, while Apple's revenue and adjusted earnings exceeded market expectations, the reported earnings per share did not due to the one-time tax charge.\n\n**YES**, in terms of revenue and adjusted earnings, but **NO** in terms of reported earnings per share due to the one-time charge. However, given the complexity, the most accurate answer would be:\n\n**UNCLEAR**, as it depends on how one interprets \"strong earnings report\" in the context of both revenue and earnings per share.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any upcoming events or factors that could significantly boost Apple's market cap before November 29, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several upcoming events and factors that could potentially boost Apple's market cap before November 29, 2024.\n\n1. **Apple's September 9 Event**: Although the event has already occurred, the impact of the announcements made during this event, such as the launch of the iPhone 16 series, new Apple Watch models, and updated AirPods, could continue to drive market interest and boost Apple's stock performance in the coming weeks.\n\n2. **Product Launches and Upgrades**: The introduction of new features like the Capture button and enhanced camera capabilities in the iPhone 16 series, as well as the integration of AI features, are expected to drive significant sales and appeal to tech-savvy consumers. Similarly, the new Apple Watch Series 10 and the budget-friendly Apple Watch SE 3 could attract health-conscious consumers and capture a broader market segment.\n\n3. **Financial Performance and Investor Confidence**: Apple's strong financial performance, including a record revenue of $85.8 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, and a robust installed base of active devices, provides a solid foundation for future growth. Transparent communication with investors and effective marketing strategies could further sustain interest and confidence in Appleâ€™s stock.\n\nThese factors suggest that Apple has several potential drivers that could positively impact its market cap in the near term.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Apple announced any significant product releases or innovations scheduled before November 29, 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nApple has announced several significant product releases and innovations scheduled before November 29, 2024:\n\n## New iMac\nApple has introduced a new iMac featuring the M4 chip, Apple Intelligence, and various enhancements such as a 12MP Center Stage camera, nano-texture display option, and Thunderbolt 4 connectivity. This iMac is available for pre-order and will be available starting November 8.\n\n## Mac mini\nA completely redesigned Mac mini with the M4 and M4 Pro chips has been unveiled. This new Mac mini features a dramatically smaller design, Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, and improved performance options. It is available for pre-order and will be available starting November 8.\n\n## MacBook Pro\nApple is expected to refresh the MacBook Pro lineup with the M4-series chips in late 2024, including the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 chip, and the 14-inch and 16-inch models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips. These are anticipated to be announced in an October event and released in November 2024.\n\n## iPad Updates\nThere is a strong possibility of updates to the iPad and iPad mini, although specific details on the exact release dates are less clear. However, these updates are expected to include chip bumps and other minor improvements, potentially announced in the October event.\n\nThese announcements and releases are all scheduled to occur before November 29, 2024.",
    "comment": "(a) There are 21 days left until the outcome of the question is known.\n\n(b) If nothing changed, the outcome would be **No**, since Nvidia currently holds the largest market cap.\n\n(c) If there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 5 days), I would forecast a lower probability of Apple regaining the top spot, perhaps around **25%**.\n\n(d) If there was 4 times the time left (approximately 84 days), I would forecast a higher probability due to more time for market fluctuations and potential impact from Apple's product releases, perhaps around **60%**.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nCurrently, Nvidia is ranked #1 by market capitalization, holding a slight lead over Apple. Apple has a history of quickly regaining the top spot after losing it, and there are upcoming events that could positively impact its market cap, such as the release of new products like the iMac with M4 chip, Mac mini, and potential updates to the MacBook Pro and iPad lineup before November 29, 2024.\n\nApple's recent stock price has shown modest growth, and strong product sales from recent launches could boost investor confidence. Additionally, while there are no significant negative news or setbacks for Nvidia, the highly volatile nature of the tech industry means market caps can shift rapidly, especially with influential companies like Apple.\n\nGiven the time remaining and Apple's potential catalysts for growth, there is a reasonable probability that Apple could reclaim the #1 spot by November 29, 2024.\n\n**Probability: 45%**",
