    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the average daily temperature for December 2024 recorded by the Barrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station (on the Arctic coast of Alaska) exceed the 1945-2023 average for December?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-03\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the average daily temperature for December 2024 recorded by the Barrow/Port Rogers National Weather Service weather station in Alaska exceeds the 1945-2023 average for December. Specifically, it will be the figure for December 2024 under \"Average Daily Temperature (high+low)/2 [F]\" listed at [this webpage](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/monthlysum.php?station=PABR&network=AK_ASOS) by Iowa Environmental Mesonet.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that Iowa Environmental Mesonet is the only data provider that will be used for resolution. The specific link to the webpage within the resolution source's website is provided for convenience, but if the resolution data is at a different page at the resolution source, then that page will be used for resolution.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the [Arctic Council](https://arctic-council.org/explore/topics/climate/), \"The temperatures in the Arctic continue to rise at three times the global annual average, driving many of the changes underway in the Arctic. Most prominently, snow and ice are melting at an increasing rate. This impacts both local ecosystems and the global climate system. It contributes to rising sea levels, and is likely to provoke extreme temperature events beyond the Arctic. The effects of a shifting Arctic climate are felt across the high latitudes and beyond – with global environmental, economic, and social implications.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the average daily temperature for December 2024 in Barrow, Alaska, will exceed the 1945-2023 average, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Temperature Data\n- The historical temperature data for Barrow, Alaska, shows significant variability. For example, the annual temperature rankings from 1920 to 2016 indicate that temperatures can fluctuate widely from year to year[1].\n\n## Average December Temperatures\n- In December, Barrow typically experiences very cold temperatures. The average daily high temperatures range from 0°F to -4°F, and the average daily low temperatures are even colder[2].\n\n## Long-term Trends\n- While there is a general trend of warming in Arctic regions due to climate change, the year-to-year variability is high. This means that some years can still be significantly colder than others, even within a broader warming trend.\n\n## Current Climate Context\n- Barrow, now known as Utqiaġvik, is one of the coldest inhabited places in the United States. The climate is characterized by long, frigid winters and short, cool summers. The extreme latitude of Barrow results in polar night during December, which contributes to the very cold temperatures[3].\n\n## Predictive Uncertainty\n- Given the high variability in Arctic weather and the limited predictability of specific monthly temperatures more than a few weeks in advance, it is challenging to make a definitive prediction about whether December 2024 will exceed the historical average.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the available information, it is not possible to clearly answer whether the average daily temperature for December 2024 will exceed the 1945-2023 average with certainty. The high variability in Arctic weather patterns and the inherent uncertainty in short-term climate predictions make it difficult to predict specific monthly temperatures accurately. Therefore, this question cannot be answered as a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" without additional real-time data or more advanced climate modeling.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 compared to previous years?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or information regarding greenhouse gas emissions for the year 2024. The sources provide detailed information up to 2022 and some projections, but they do not include actual emissions data for 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent climate models predicted higher temperatures for the Arctic region in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication that recent climate models have predicted higher temperatures specifically for the Arctic region in December 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss temperature anomalies and weather patterns for various regions, including the Eastern US, Europe, and Asia, but they do not provide specific predictions for the Arctic region's temperatures in December 2024[1][2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any large-scale weather events, such as heatwaves, currently affecting the Arctic region in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of large-scale heatwaves currently affecting the Arctic region in December 2024. Instead, the sources discuss cold and arctic air masses affecting various regions, particularly in the continental United States, but do not mention any heatwaves in the Arctic[2][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Barrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station reported any unusual warming trends in the past year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about unusual warming trends in the past year for the Barrow/Utqiagvik NWS weather station.\n\n- The first source provides climate data for October 9, 2024, but it does not discuss trends over the past year specifically. It gives daily and monthly climate summaries but does not analyze yearly trends[1].\n- The other sources discuss broader climate trends and changes, particularly in Canada and the Arctic region, but do not provide specific data for the past year at the Barrow/Utqiagvik NWS weather station[2][3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the historical average daily temperature for December at the Barrow/Port Rogers station shown a consistent upward trend since 1945?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not contain specific data or analyses regarding the historical average daily temperature trends for December at the Barrow/Port Rogers station since 1945.\n\n- The Wikipedia article on weather records does not provide trend data for specific stations[1].\n- The document on stochastic weather generators does not include historical temperature trend data for any specific station[2].\n- The Weather Underground page for Utqiaġvik (formerly known as Barrow), Alaska, provides some weather data, but it does not include a long-term trend analysis starting from 1945[3].\n- The State of the Climate report does not provide station-specific trend data for Barrow/Port Rogers[4].\n\nTherefore, based on the available sources, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there strong El Niño or La Niña conditions influencing global weather patterns in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, as of December 2024, there are no strong El Niño or La Niña conditions influencing global weather patterns.\n\n- The sources indicate that ENSO-neutral conditions have been prevailing, with a potential transition to a weak La Niña event. For example, the WMO update mentions a 60% chance of La Niña emerging towards the end of 2024, but it is expected to be weak and short-lived[1][4][5].\n- The latest forecasts suggest that La Niña, if it emerges, will be weak and not likely to result in conventional winter impacts[3][4].\n\nTherefore, the current conditions are not characterized by strong El Niño or La Niña events.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a reduction in Arctic sea ice thickness in recent months at the Barrow/Port Rogers location?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically address the sea ice thickness at the Barrow/Port Rogers location in recent months. Here are the key points:\n\n- The NOAA Arctic Report Card and other sources discuss general trends and conditions of Arctic sea ice, including thickness and extent, but they do not provide location-specific data for Barrow/Port Rogers[1][3][5].\n- The data and analyses presented are more generalized, covering broader regions such as the Arctic Ocean, the Beaufort Sea, and the Laptev Sea, but do not focus on specific locations like Barrow/Port Rogers.\n\nGiven this, the answer to whether there has been a reduction in Arctic sea ice thickness in recent months at the Barrow/Port Rogers location is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Arctic sea ice extent lower in 2024 compared to the historical average for December?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically address the Arctic sea ice extent for December 2024, but they do provide context on the overall trend and the extent for other months.\n\n- The 2024 Arctic sea ice minimum extent, which occurred in September, was the seventh lowest on record and significantly below the 1981-2010 average minimum extent[1][2][4].\n- For October 2024, the Arctic sea ice extent was the fourth lowest in the 46-year satellite record and also below the 1981-2010 average[5].\n\nGiven the long-term downward trend in Arctic sea ice extent, it is likely that the extent in December 2024 would also be lower than the historical average. However, since there is no specific data provided for December 2024, the answer must be based on the general trend rather than direct evidence.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the global average temperature increased compared to the 20th-century average?\nANSWER: Yes, the global average temperature has increased compared to the 20th-century average.\n\nMultiple sources confirm this trend:\n- According to NOAA, the global average surface temperature in 2023 was the warmest on record since recordkeeping began in 1880, and every month of 2023 ranked among the 7 warmest for that month[1].\n- NASA reports that Earth’s average surface temperature in 2023 was about 2.45 degrees Fahrenheit (or about 1.36 degrees Celsius) warmer than the late 19th-century (1850-1900) preindustrial average, and the 10 most recent years are the warmest on record[4].\n- The Copernicus Climate Change Service indicates that the five-year-average global temperature from 2019 to 2023 was the highest on record, and there has been an average increase of 0.1°C approximately every five years since the mid-1970s[3].\n\nThese sources collectively demonstrate a significant increase in global average temperature compared to the 20th-century average.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent policy changes aimed at reducing carbon emissions globally?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent developments and discussions around policy changes aimed at reducing carbon emissions globally, although the implementation and effectiveness of these changes vary.\n\n1. **Carbon Pricing Expansion**: The World Bank's \"State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2024\" report highlights the expansion of carbon pricing instruments, with 24% of global emissions now covered by such mechanisms. This includes the implementation of carbon taxes and Emission Trading Systems (ETS) in more sectors and countries, including large middle-income countries like Brazil, India, and others[2].\n\n2. **G7 Climate Policy Recommendations**: The \"What good looks like: G7 climate policy 2024 update\" report outlines key policy recommendations for the G7 countries to align their emissions reduction targets with the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal. These recommendations include strengthening national climate targets, phasing out fossil fuels, and accelerating the adoption of renewables and energy efficiency[3].\n\n3. **UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2024**: The report emphasizes the need for nations to commit to significant emissions cuts by 2030 and 2035 to meet the Paris Agreement goals. It calls for updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and rapid action to close the huge emissions gap, highlighting the necessity of massive global mobilization to achieve these targets[4].\n\n4. **Electrification and Decarbonization Efforts**: The International Energy Agency's (IEA) \"Global EV Outlook 2024\" discusses the importance of road transport electrification and power grid decarbonization in achieving substantial emission reductions. The report notes that current policies are not aligned with a net-zero by 2050 pathway, but there is potential for significant emissions savings through sustained decarbonization efforts[5].\n\nThese reports and recommendations indicate ongoing efforts and discussions at the global level to implement and enhance policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nToday is December 3, 2024. The outcome will be determined at the end of December 2024.  \n**Time left:** 28 days.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions remain consistent with historical patterns, the average daily temperature for December 2024 at the Barrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station would **not** exceed the 1945-2023 average.  \n**Outcome:** **No**\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only 7 days remaining in December, real-time temperature data would provide clearer insight. Assuming slight warming trends continue without significant anomalies, there's a modest increase in the likelihood of exceeding the historical average.  \n**Forecast:** **55%**\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was four times the time left:**  \nIf the forecast were made much earlier in the year (effectively providing 112 days of additional data and warming trend analysis), the probability of exceeding the historical average would likely be higher due to the pronounced Arctic warming trends.  \n**Forecast:** **65%**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe Arctic region, including Barrow/Port Rogers, has been experiencing warming at a rate three times the global average, driven by climate change. Historical data indicates high year-to-year variability in December temperatures, making short-term predictions challenging. While long-term trends suggest a warming Arctic, the specific conditions in December 2024 remain uncertain due to potential variability in weather patterns, sea ice extent, and other short-term factors. Given the proximity to the end of December and the ongoing warming trends, a balanced probability reflects both the long-term warming signals and the inherent short-term uncertainties.\n\n**Probability:** **60%**",
