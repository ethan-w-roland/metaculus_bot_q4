    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the cheapest new Tesla Model Y be listed as under $44,990 on December 30, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-12\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, on December 30, 2024, the cheapest Tesla Model Y for US buyers is offered at the Tesla website for under $44,990. If the price is greater than or equal to $44,990, this question resolves as **No**. On of after December 30, 2024, Metaculus Admins will access the Model Y design page, currently at [this link](https://www.tesla.com/modely/design#overview). They will click on the \"Cash\" price and uncheck the box to include estimated incentives of $7,500 and 5-year gas savings.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source other than Tesla's official website will be considered. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs of December 11, 2024, this price was $44,990\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the cheapest new Tesla Model Y will be listed as under $44,990 on December 30, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Pricing\nAs of the current data, the base MSRP for the 2024 Tesla Model Y starts at $44,990 for the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) version. However, there have been instances where Tesla has slashed prices to clear inventory. For example, in April 2024, Tesla reduced the price of the Model Y RWD to as low as $40,940[2].\n\n## Recent Price Adjustments\nTesla has a history of adjusting prices, and these adjustments can be significant. The recent price slashing in April 2024 brought the price of a Model Y RWD down to $40,940, which is below the $44,990 MSRP[2].\n\n## Federal EV Tax Credit\nThe IRS classification of the Model Y as an SUV allows it to qualify for federal EV tax credits up to $7,500, which can further reduce the effective price for eligible buyers[4].\n\n## Lease and Finance Offers\nCurrent lease and finance offers also indicate that Tesla is providing incentives to make the Model Y more affordable. For instance, lease prices can be as low as $336 per month plus tax, and there are additional discounts available through referral codes and other promotions[3].\n\nGiven these points, it is plausible that Tesla could continue to offer the Model Y at a price below $44,990, especially if they are trying to clear out inventory or maintain competitive pricing.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the base MSRP is $44,990, Tesla's recent pricing strategies and inventory clearance efforts suggest that it is possible for the cheapest new Tesla Model Y to be listed under this price on December 30, 2024. However, this cannot be definitively confirmed without real-time pricing data from Tesla on that specific date.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Tesla implemented any price reductions for the Model Y in the first half of 2024?\nANSWER: YES, Tesla has implemented price reductions for the Model Y in the first half of 2024.\n\n- There were temporary price cuts in February 2024, where the prices of the Model Y variants were reduced by $1,000, but these prices increased again on March 1, 2024[3][4].\n- In April 2024, Tesla dropped the prices of the Model Y by $2,000, bringing the prices back down to their lowest levels. For example, the Model Y RWD now starts at $42,990, and the Long Range and Performance models also saw similar reductions[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the price of the Tesla Model Y influenced by changes in federal or state EV incentives as of December 2024?\nANSWER: As of December 2024, the price of the Tesla Model Y can indeed be influenced by changes in federal EV incentives.\n\n1. **Federal Tax Credit**: The federal EV tax credit of up to $7,500 can significantly affect the effective price of the Tesla Model Y. For example, the Model Y Long Range AWD is eligible for this credit, which reduces its effective price for eligible buyers[2][3].\n\n2. **Eligibility and Changes**: The eligibility for these credits can change based on new rules and battery sourcing requirements, which can impact the number of vehicles that qualify for the credit. This means that any changes in these rules can influence the pricing strategy and the final cost to the consumer[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Tesla Model Y been listed below $44,990 on the official website at any point in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the Tesla Model Y has been listed below $44,990 at certain points in 2024, especially when considering the federal tax credit.\n\n- The base price for the 2024 Tesla Model Y starts at $44,380, but with the federal EV tax credit of up to $7,500, the effective price can be as low as $36,880[1][5].\n\n- Specifically, the effective price for the 2024 Tesla Model Y Long Range RWD, after including the tax credit, can be as low as $39,130[5].\n\nTherefore, when factoring in the tax credit, the Model Y has indeed been listed below $44,990.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current base MSRP for the 2024 Tesla Model Y listed as $44,990 on Tesla's official website?\nANSWER: The current base MSRP for the 2024 Tesla Model Y is indeed listed as $44,990 in several reliable sources, which aligns with what would be expected on Tesla's official website, even though the sources provided are from third-party sites.\n\n- According to Car and Driver, the 2024 Tesla Model Y starts at $44,630, but this is slightly lower than the $44,990 mentioned in other sources[1].\n- KBB.com and Electrek.co both state that the base MSRP for the 2024 Tesla Model Y is $44,990[2][3].\n- Edmunds also confirms the base MSRP as $44,990[4].\n\nGiven this consistency across multiple sources, it is reasonable to conclude that the base MSRP is $44,990.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Tesla actively engaged in inventory clearance efforts for the Model Y in late 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Tesla is actively engaged in inventory clearance efforts for the Model Y in late 2024.\n\n- As of October 2024, Tesla reintroduced inventory discounts for the Model 3 and Model Y, offering significant savings to clear out inventory[1].\n- In December 2024, Tesla continued to offer inventory discounts, including price reductions and other incentives to encourage sales of the Model Y[4].\n- These efforts indicate a persistent strategy to clear out inventory, particularly for the Model Y, during the late 2024 period.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive version of the Tesla Model Y the cheapest configuration available?\nANSWER: No, the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive version of the Tesla Model Y is not the cheapest configuration available.\n\nThe cheapest configuration of the 2024 Tesla Model Y is the Standard version, although it has been discontinued midway through the model year and replaced by the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive. However, as of the current pricing, the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive is not the base model.\n\nHere are the prices for comparison:\n- The least-expensive 2024 Tesla Model Y, before the discontinuation of the Standard model, started at around $42,990[1][3][5].\n- The Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive model starts at $44,990[1][3][5].\n\nThus, the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive is not the cheapest option available.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Tesla announced any planned price changes for the Model Y for the remainder of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the relevant information:\n\n- Tesla has already implemented a price reduction for the Model Y in 2024, cutting the prices by $2,000 in the U.S., which brings the entry-level RWD version to an MSRP of $42,990[1].\n- There have been previous discounts and incentives, such as a $1,000 discount on the Model Y RWD and Long Range models in February 2024[2].\n- While there are ongoing promotions and incentives to boost sales, there is no specific announcement about additional planned price changes for the remainder of 2024. However, the sources suggest that Tesla may continue to offer various incentives and discounts to keep sales momentum high[1][2][4].\n\nGiven this information, it is unclear if there are any new, specific price changes planned for the remainder of 2024 beyond the already implemented reductions and ongoing incentives.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the federal EV tax credit of $7,500 still applicable to Tesla Model Y purchases as of December 2024?\nANSWER: As of December 2024, the eligibility for the federal EV tax credit for Tesla Model Y purchases is subject to several conditions and has undergone recent changes.\n\n- The tax credit of up to $7,500 is still available, but the vehicle must meet specific criteria, such as being assembled in North America and having at least 50% of its battery-critical minerals sourced from North America or countries with a free trade agreement with the United States[2][4][5].\n- The rules have become more stringent, and not all Tesla models or variants may qualify for the full $7,500 credit. For example, only certain versions of the Tesla Model Y, such as the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive, may be eligible[5].\n- The eligibility can vary based on the vehicle's specific configuration, including the battery and assembly location[5].\n\nGiven these conditions, it is not a straightforward yes or no. However, it is clear that some Tesla Model Y versions can still qualify for the tax credit, but it depends on meeting the specified criteria.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR** (without specifying the exact model and configuration of the Tesla Model Y).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any reported supply chain issues that could affect the pricing of Tesla vehicles in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are indications of past and ongoing issues that could potentially impact the pricing of Tesla vehicles, although they may not be specifically dated to December 2024.\n\n1. **Historical Supply Chain Issues**: The sources mention that Tesla has faced supply chain challenges, particularly during the pandemic, which affected production and pricing. For example, in 2020, supply chain challenges and inflation impacted the auto industry, leading to price increases for Tesla vehicles[3].\n\n2. **Current Production and Market Dynamics**: Tesla's Q2 2024 report highlights production issues and increased competition, which could influence pricing strategies. However, these issues are not specifically projected to continue into December 2024[1].\n\n3. **Inflation and Future Pricing**: Elon Musk mentioned that Tesla could lower prices once inflation calms down, indicating that current pricing is influenced by future cost predictions due to supply chain and inflation uncertainties. However, this does not confirm ongoing supply chain issues specifically for December 2024[3].\n\nGiven the information, while there are historical and general indications of supply chain and pricing dynamics, there is no specific confirmation of supply chain issues that would definitely affect pricing in December 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any current promotions, discounts, or referral programs available for the Tesla Model Y?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several current promotions, discounts, and referral programs available for the Tesla Model Y:\n\n## 0% APR Financing\nTesla is offering 0% APR financing on the Model Y for well-qualified buyers. This offer is available for orders placed by December 15, 2024, and delivery must be taken by December 31, 2024. The financing is available for terms up to 60 months and requires a minimum down payment of 20%[1][2].\n\n## Free Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and Supercharging\nCustomers who take delivery of a new Model Y between November 14, 2024, and December 31, 2024, are eligible for three months of free Full Self-Driving (Supervised) and unlimited Supercharging[1][3].\n\n## Referral Program\nTesla has an updated referral program that offers up to a $2,000 discount for buyers who use a referral code from an existing Tesla owner. Referrers can earn $1,000 for each successful referral. This program applies to the Model Y, among other Tesla models[3][4].\n\n## Additional Discounts\nUsing a referral code can provide an additional $2,000 off the price of the Model Y. When combined with other incentives, such as the federal tax credit, the price of a Model Y can be significantly reduced[1][4].\n\n## Military Rebate\nThere is also a $1,000 military rebate available for eligible buyers of the 2024 Model Y Electric[5].",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n18 days (from December 12, 2024, to December 30, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nNo. If Tesla maintains the current pricing without any adjustments, the cheapest new Tesla Model Y would remain listed at $44,990.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 4-5 days left, the likelihood of Tesla implementing a price reduction sufficient to bring the \"Cash\" price below $44,990 is minimal. Therefore, the forecast would be **No**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith around 72 days, Tesla would have more opportunity to adjust pricing based on inventory levels, market demand, or competitive pressures. Historical patterns indicate that Tesla has made price adjustments in the past to clear inventory. In this extended timeframe, there's a moderate possibility that Tesla could reduce the \"Cash\" price below $44,990.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nGiven the current MSRP of $44,990 for the Tesla Model Y and the resolution criteria specifying the \"Cash\" price without incentives, the default outcome without any changes is a \"No.\" While Tesla has a history of adjusting prices to manage inventory and respond to market conditions, the short remaining time (18 days) limits the likelihood of another price drop. Additionally, there is no concrete evidence or announcements indicating a planned price reduction in this specific timeframe. However, Tesla's ongoing inventory clearance efforts and historical responsiveness to market dynamics suggest that there is a possibility, albeit low, of a price adjustment.\n\nConsidering all factors, including the limited time remaining, the established pricing, and the absence of confirmed imminent price cuts, the probability that the cheapest new Tesla Model Y will be listed as under $44,990 on December 30, 2024, is relatively low.\n\n**Probability:** 20%",
