    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the US weekly 30-year fixed mortgage rate be below 7.00% on December 31, 2024, according to Freddie Mac?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 30 year fixed-rate mortgage is less than 7.00% at the Freddie Mac tracker page at [this location](https://www.freddiemac.com/pmms), when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after December 31, 2024. If the 30-Yr FRM is greater than or equal to 7.00%, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe resolution amount of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage will be the one displayed at the moment Metaculus Admins access the Freddie Mac tracker page. It will be the rate listed as the 30-Yr FRM under \"Primary Mortgage Market SurveyÂ®\". It will be immaterial what period that covers, and the question will resolve based on whatever figure is shown. The time of day that the page will be accessed is also not going to be listed; Metaculus Admins will merely access the webpage at their convenience at some point on or after that date and record the rate listed.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe 30-year fixed rate mortgage according to the resolution sounce as of November 22, 2024 was 6.84%.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the US weekly 30-year fixed mortgage rate being below 7.00% on December 31, 2024, here are some key points and trends from the available sources:\n\n## Current Rates and Trends\n- As of late October 2024, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was at 6.72% according to Freddie Mac's Primary Mortgage Market Survey[1][5].\n- The rates have been trending downward, with a recent drop following the Federal Reserve's rate cut in September 2024. There is an expectation of another rate cut in November 2024, which could further lower mortgage rates[1][3].\n\n## Forecasts\n- Several forecasts suggest that mortgage rates will continue to decline. LendingTree's senior economist, Jacob Channel, predicts that rates could fall closer to 6% by the end of 2024 if the Fed institutes another rate cut[1].\n- Fannie Mae and the Mortgage Bankers Association also predict that 30-year mortgage rates will decrease to around 6% to 6.3% by the end of the year[3].\n\n## Economic Factors\n- The overall economic outlook, including cooling inflation and a soft landing for the economy, supports the expectation of lower mortgage rates. However, factors such as strong economic data, slow inflation decline, and concerns about government borrowing could influence rates to remain elevated in the short term[2][3].\n\n## Historical Context\n- The long-term average for 30-year mortgage rates is around 7.72%, but current rates are already below this average. The recent decline from over 7% to below 7% suggests a downward trend, although rates can fluctuate[4].\n\nGiven these points, it is plausible that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate could remain below 7.00% by December 31, 2024, especially if the anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts materialize and economic conditions continue to support lower interest rates. However, the exact rate on December 31, 2024, will depend on various economic and geopolitical factors that could influence mortgage rates in the coming weeks.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile there is a strong indication that rates will remain below 7.00%, the answer is not definitively yes or no without considering the potential for unforeseen economic or geopolitical events that could impact mortgage rates. The forecasts and current trends, however, lean towards the likelihood of rates staying below 7.00% by the end of 2024.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Federal Reserve implemented an interest rate cut in November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the Federal Reserve implemented an interest rate cut in November 2024. At its November 2024 meeting, the Fed cut the interest rates by 0.25%[1][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the US inflation rate below 3% as of November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 2024, the annual inflation rate in the US is 2.6%, which is below 3%[1][2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have unemployment rates in the US remained stable or decreased since October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the unemployment rate in the US has remained stable since October 2024, but there is no data available to indicate any changes beyond that month.\n\n- The unemployment rate in October 2024 was 4.1%, and it remained unchanged from the previous month[1][2][5].\n- There are no sources provided that report on the unemployment rate for November 2024 or later, so we cannot determine if there have been any changes since October 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have housing market trends continued to support lower mortgage rates since October 2024?\nANSWER: The housing market trends since October 2024 do not strongly support the continuation of lower mortgage rates. Here are the key points:\n\n- Mortgage rates have actually increased since the week of September 19, 2024, despite a Fed rate cut. As of November 7, 2024, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate was at 6.79%, up from 6.09% in September[3].\n- While there is an expectation that mortgage rates will decline over the next 6-9 months, this decline is projected to be gradual, with an average mortgage rate of 6.17% in Q4 2024 and 5.90% in Q2 2025[3].\n- The current trends indicate that mortgage rates, although lower than their peak, are still high and are affecting affordability and home sales[5].\n\nTherefore, the current housing market trends do not indicate a significant or immediate support for lower mortgage rates since October 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant increase in government borrowing in the US since October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence of ongoing and significant government borrowing in the US, but the specific focus on the period since October 2024 is not fully detailed in a way that isolates the increase solely to that month or the subsequent period.\n\n- The source from the Peterson Foundation discusses the deficit for October 2024 but does not provide a detailed breakdown of borrowing trends specifically since that month[1].\n- The Statista source mentions the public debt as of October 2024 but does not provide a comparison of borrowing rates since then[2].\n- The Highland County Press article discusses the fiscal year 2024 deficit and debt, including projections for future borrowing, but it does not specifically address the borrowing increase since October 2024[3].\n\nGiven the information, it is unclear whether there has been a significant increase in government borrowing specifically since October 2024, as the sources do not provide the necessary detailed comparison for this specific time frame.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major economists forecasted that 30-year fixed mortgage rates will be below 7.00% by December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, major economists have forecasted that 30-year fixed mortgage rates will be below 7.00% by December 31, 2024.\n\n- Fannie Mae predicts that the 30-year fixed mortgage rate will average 6.7% in 2024 and end the year around 6.6%[2][4].\n- The National Association of Realtors forecasts that 30-year mortgage rates will end 2024 at 6.1%[3].\n- The Mortgage Bankers Association and Fannie Mae also project rates to be around 6.2% by the end of 2024[1][3].\n- Wells Fargo predicts the average 30-year fixed interest rate to settle at 6.15% for Q4 2024[1].\n\nAll of these forecasts indicate that the rates will be below 7.00% by the end of 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been no unexpected geopolitical events since October 2024 that could impact US mortgage rates?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several geopolitical events that have occurred or are scheduled to occur since October 2024, which could potentially impact US mortgage rates due to their broader economic and geopolitical implications.\n\n- The BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, from October 22-24, which includes new members and could influence global economic and geopolitical dynamics[2][3][4].\n- The IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings from October 21-26, which can impact global economic policies and stability[1].\n- The US presidential election on November 5, which has significant implications for domestic and international policies, including those affecting the economy and financial markets[2][3][4].\n- The COP29 U.N. Climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, from November 11-24, which could influence global climate policies and economic decisions[1][2][3].\n- The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, which continues to escalate and impact global energy and food security, inflation, and financial markets[2][4][5].\n- The potential for increased US-China trade tensions and financial decoupling, which could disrupt global financial markets[5].\n\nGiven these events, it is clear that there have been and will continue to be significant geopolitical developments since October 2024 that could impact US mortgage rates.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been no major economic downturns in the US since October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of a major economic downturn in the US since October 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The economy is described as being on more stable footing, with strong consumer spending, robust GDP growth, and a labor market that, although showing signs of slowing, is still strong[1][2][3].\n- Forecasts indicate continued economic growth, albeit at a slower pace, and do not mention any imminent major economic downturns[2][3].\n- Consumer confidence has improved, and the likelihood of a recession over the next 12 months has dropped to its lowest level since July 2022[4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US economy achieved a soft landing with cooling inflation as of November 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 2024, the indicators suggest that the US economy is on the path to achieving a soft landing, but it has not yet been definitively confirmed.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- The economy has shown slowing inflation, with the annual inflation rate at 2.4% as of September, which is close to the Fed's target[3][4].\n- Job creation, although slower, remains positive, and the unemployment rate has stabilized at 4.1% after a slight increase[1][3][4].\n- Economic growth has continued, with the second quarter of 2024 showing a growth rate of 3%, and expectations for continued growth in the third quarter[2][3].\n- The Federal Reserve has started easing its monetary policy with a rate cut in September, which is seen as a step towards a soft landing[3][4].\n\nHowever, there are still uncertainties and risks, such as geopolitical tensions, the upcoming presidential elections, and potential disruptions from natural disasters, that could impact the economy's trajectory[3][4][5].\n\nGiven the current data and trends, it appears that the US economy is moving towards a soft landing, but the situation is still being monitored closely.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as it is not definitively confirmed but strongly indicated)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have 30-year fixed mortgage rates continued to decline since September 2024?\nANSWER: No, 30-year fixed mortgage rates have not continued to decline steadily since September 2024.\n\nWhile mortgage rates did drop to a two-year low in September 2024, reaching as low as 6.15% or 6.24% depending on the source[1][3][4], they have since increased. As of November, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has risen back to around 6.60% to 6.88%[2][4][5].\n\nThis indicates that after the September low, mortgage rates experienced an upward trend rather than a continued decline.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 39 days (from November 22, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions remain unchanged, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate would stay at 6.84%, which is below the 7.00% threshold.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith roughly 10 days remaining, the rate is likely to remain close to its current level of 6.84%. Given the short time frame, significant changes are unlikely, and the rate would probably still be below 7.00%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nHypothetically extending the time frame to around 160 days would allow for more economic developments and potential rate adjustments. However, given the current downward trend and favorable economic indicators, it's reasonable to expect that mortgage rates would still remain below 7.00%.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAs of November 22, 2024, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate stands at 6.84%, already below the 7.00% mark. Recent economic indicators are favorable, with the Federal Reserve implementing rate cuts, inflation below 3%, and stable unemployment rates. Major economists and financial institutions forecast rates to remain around or below 6.3% by year-end. While there have been slight upticks in mortgage rates since September 2024, the overall trend supported by economic policies and stable economic indicators suggests that rates will stay below 7.00%. Potential geopolitical events and market fluctuations pose minor risks, but they are unlikely to push the rates above the 7.00% threshold within the remaining timeframe.\n\n**Probability: 95%**",
