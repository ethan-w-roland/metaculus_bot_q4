    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill China's youth unemployment rate be greater than 18.0 and less than or equal to 19.0 for October 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-07\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve based on the youth unemployment rate for October 2024, as reported by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/youth-unemployment-rate), using data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\r\nThe question will resolve based on the reported youth unemployment rate, rounded to the nearest 0.1 percentage point.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe youth unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force aged 16-24 without work but available for and seeking employment, based on the calculation method used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China as of August 2024.\r\n\r\nIf the National Bureau of Statistics of China revises its calculation method or age range for the youth unemployment rate before September 2024, the question will be resolved using the most up-to-date definition and methodology.\r\n\r\nIn the event that Trading Economics does not report the youth unemployment rate for August 2024 before October 7, 2024, or if the data is not available from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the question will resolve as \"Annulled\". The data can be found [directly from the NBS here](https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=A01) by selecting \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate\" under \"Indicators\" on the left side and observing the data in the row labeled \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate of the Population Aged from 16 to 24 Excluding Students(%)\".\n\nBACKGROUND:\nChina's youth unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people aged 16 to 24 who are not in school and are unemployed, has been a growing concern for the country's policymakers and economists. In July 2024, the rate [soared to 17.1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/chinas-youth-unemployment-soars-above-17percent-in-july.html), the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December 2023.\r\n\r\nThe new calculation method, introduced in late 2023, excludes those who are still in school, as more people in China are pursuing higher education amid a more competitive job market. Under the previous calculation method, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023.\r\n\r\nThe rising youth unemployment rate has been attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes in the labor market. As the issue continues to draw attention, this question aims to predict the youth unemployment rate for August 2024, providing insight into the short-term trajectory of this critical economic indicator.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether China's youth unemployment rate will be greater than 18.0 and less than or equal to 19.0 for October 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends\n- The youth unemployment rate in China has been rising due to an economic downturn and stringent hiring practices. In August 2024, the rate hit 18.8%, which is the highest since the new record-keeping system began in December.\n- For September 2024, the rate slightly decreased to 17.6%.\n\n## Economic Conditions\n- China's economy is experiencing significant challenges, including a real estate downturn, reduced consumer and employer confidence, and contractions in high-value urban service sectors such as real estate, finance, and IT.\n- The overall urban unemployment rate has remained relatively stable around 5%, but the youth unemployment rate is notably higher due to the specific challenges faced by young job seekers.\n\n## Historical Context\n- The youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023 before China adjusted its data collection methods to exclude students, which lowered the reported rate.\n\n## Projections and Expectations\n- There are no specific projections for the October 2024 youth unemployment rate in the available sources. However, the general trend and economic conditions suggest that the rate is likely to remain high.\n- Trading Economics models project the youth unemployment rate to trend around 18.5% in 2025 and 18.0% in 2026, but these are long-term projections and not specific to October 2024.\n\nGiven the current trends and economic conditions, it is uncertain whether the youth unemployment rate will fall within the specified range (greater than 18.0 and less than or equal to 19.0) for October 2024. The rate has shown volatility and is influenced by various economic and policy factors, making it difficult to predict with certainty without more specific data or projections for October.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the Chinese government change the method of calculating youth unemployment rate in 2023 to exclude students?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe Chinese government did change the method of calculating the youth unemployment rate in 2023 to exclude students. This is indicated in multiple sources, which mention that the new methodology excludes university students from the unemployment calculations.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China's youth unemployment rate exceeded 18% in 2023 according to the latest available data as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, China's youth unemployment rate did exceed 18% in 2023, but the specific context and timing need to be considered.\n\nIn June 2023, the youth unemployment rate in China hit a record high of 21.3%, which is well above 18%.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether China's youth unemployment rate exceeded 18% in 2023 is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been concerns about the accuracy or reliability of China's reported youth unemployment statistics as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been concerns about the accuracy or reliability of China's reported youth unemployment statistics as of October 2023.\n\nSeveral sources highlight these concerns:\n- The methodology for calculating youth unemployment was revised to exclude students, which has led to lower reported rates but raises questions about the completeness of the data.\n- Analysts have speculated that the true scale of youth unemployment might be larger than the data suggests, particularly because China's definition of employment includes working at least one hour per week, which does not account for underemployment.\n- The temporary suspension of reporting youth unemployment data and the subsequent changes in methodology have also raised scrutiny about the accuracy and reliability of the statistics.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are economic forecasts predicting a significant decrease in China's youth unemployment rate in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the economic forecasts do not indicate a significant decrease in China's youth unemployment rate for the remainder of 2024.\n\n- The youth unemployment rate in China was 18.8% in August and slightly decreased to 17.6% in September, but it remains at a troublesome level.\n- Trading Economics' global macro models and analysts' expectations suggest that the China Youth Unemployment Rate is expected to be around 20.0% by the end of this quarter, and in the long-term, it is projected to trend around 18.5% in 2025 and 18.0% in 2026. These projections do not indicate a significant decrease in the near future.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China's youth unemployment rate been on an upward trend throughout 2023 up to October?\nANSWER: No, China's youth unemployment rate has not been on a consistent upward trend throughout 2023 up to October.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- In June 2023, the youth unemployment rate hit a record high of 21.3%, after which China stopped publishing the monthly numbers.\n- When the data release resumed in December 2023, the rate was 14.9% after the methodology was changed to exclude students.\n- In the following months, the rate increased: it was 13.2% in June 2024, 17.1% in July, and 18.8% in August 2024.\n- However, the rate then decreased to 17.6% in September 2024.\n\nThis indicates that while there were periods of increase, there was also a decrease in September 2024, breaking the upward trend.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is China experiencing demographic shifts that could increase the number of youth entering the labor market as of 2023?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nChina is indeed experiencing demographic shifts and other factors that contribute to an increase in the number of youth entering the labor market as of 2023. Here are some key points:\n\n- The number of new graduates entering the labor market is rising, with nearly 12 million university graduates expected in 2024, which is an increase from the previous year.\n- The expansion of access to higher education in China has led to a large number of college graduates searching for jobs, exacerbating the labor market challenges.\n- Despite the government's efforts to address youth unemployment, the influx of new graduates continues to put pressure on the job market.\n\nThese factors indicate that China is facing an increase in the number of youth entering the labor market, which is a significant demographic shift.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have changes in calculation methods in the past significantly affected reported youth unemployment rates in China?\nANSWER: Yes, changes in the calculation methods have significantly affected the reported youth unemployment rates in China.\n\n- China paused reporting the youth unemployment rate for several months to reassess and revise its calculation methods. The new methodology excludes university students, which has resulted in a lower reported youth unemployment rate compared to the previous figures.\n- Before the change, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of more than 21% in June 2023. After the methodology change, the rate was reported at 18.8% in August 2024, and 17.6% in September 2024, which is still high but lower than the pre-methodology change peak.\n- The exclusion of university students from the new methodology has been highlighted as a key factor in the adjusted rates, indicating that the methodological changes have indeed impacted the reported figures.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Chinese government implemented major policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment before October 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, the Chinese government had implemented several major policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment before October 2023.\n\n- In July 2023, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, along with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance, introduced a policy to encourage employers to hire fresh college graduates and registered unemployed youth by offering a one-time allowance of 1,500 yuan ($207) for each young person hired until the end of December 2023.\n\n- The government also launched a 100-day campaign starting on June 6, 2023, to find 10 million jobs for college graduates and job seekers, and another employment campaign aimed at helping college graduates and registered unemployed youth find jobs in the five-month period until the end of December 2023.\n\n- Additionally, the government had been working on improving tax incentives for businesses to hire unpaid interns, expanding recruitment quotas for the civil service, and elevating the status of vocational schools, among other measures, prior to October 2023.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are global economic conditions negatively impacting China's economy as of October 2023?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, global economic conditions are indeed having a negative impact on China's economy. Here are some key points that support this conclusion:\n\n## External Demand\nGlobal economic conditions, such as high inflation and a cost-of-living crisis in key overseas markets like the US and Europe, have reduced demand for imported Chinese goods. This is evident from the decline in exports to major trading partners, including ASEAN countries, the EU, and the US.\n\n## Trade Performance\nChina's foreign trade has been affected, with exports experiencing a significant decline. For example, exports to the EU and the US fell by 11% and 13.8% year-on-year, respectively, in the first 11 months of 2023.\n\n## Global Economic Headwinds\nThe global economic slowdown has contributed to weaker external demand, which in turn has impacted China's export-driven economy. This is reflected in the slower growth in China's trade volume and the contraction in exports.\n\n## Impact on Consumer and Business Confidence\nGlobal economic uncertainties have also influenced domestic consumer and business confidence in China. Low household and business confidence, partly due to external economic pressures, have dampened economic activity and investment.\n\nIn summary, the evidence indicates that global economic conditions are negatively impacting China's economy as of October 2023.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have significant economic challenges persisted in China that could affect youth unemployment rates as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, significant economic challenges have persisted in China that could affect youth unemployment rates as of October 2023.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the ongoing economic issues that could impact employment, including:\n\n- **Slowing Economic Growth**: China's economic activity has fallen short of expectations, with exports collapsing, consumption, production, and investment slowing down, and inflation leveling out.\n- **Property Sector Woes**: The property sector, which is a significant component of China's economy, has been experiencing a downturn, with defaults by property developers and a surge in household debt. This sector's instability can have broad economic implications.\n- **Demographic Challenges**: China's labor force is shrinking, with the population in the 15–64 age range expected to decline about 1 percent a year by 2030. This demographic shift can affect employment opportunities.\n- **High Debt Levels**: China faces high levels of corporate and household debt, which can constrain economic growth and stability.\n- **Regulatory and Policy Challenges**: Regulatory actions have dampened business confidence, especially among technology companies and foreign-invested enterprises, which can impact job creation.\n- **Weak Consumer Demand**: Sluggish domestic demand has contributed to low inflation and weak business confidence, further affecting economic activity and potential employment opportunities.\n\nThese challenges collectively suggest that the economic environment in China as of October 2023 is not favorable for reducing youth unemployment rates.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of November 7, 2024, the youth unemployment rate for October 2024 should be released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China within the next few weeks, typically by the end of November or early December. Therefore, there is approximately **3-4 weeks** left until the outcome is known.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends continued without significant change, the youth unemployment rate would likely remain elevated due to ongoing economic challenges. Based on patterns observed up to October 2023, the rate could be expected to stay above 18.0%, potentially falling within the specified range of greater than 18.0% and less than or equal to 19.0%.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only a quarter of the time left until the data release, there would be less opportunity for significant economic shifts. This would increase confidence that the youth unemployment rate would remain within the recent range. I would forecast a **65% probability** that it falls between 18.0% and 19.0%.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were four times the current time left (approximately 12-16 weeks), there would be more room for economic developments, policy interventions, or unforeseen events affecting employment. This increased uncertainty would slightly reduce the probability. I would forecast a **55% probability** of the rate falling within the specified range.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Economic Trends:** Up to October 2023, China's youth unemployment rate had been elevated, reaching record highs before methodological changes adjusted the reported figures. The economy faced significant challenges, including a real estate downturn, reduced consumer and business confidence, and contractions in key sectors like technology and finance.\n\n- **Policy Measures:** The government implemented policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment, such as incentives for employers and employment campaigns. While these may have some impact, structural economic issues might limit their effectiveness in significantly lowering the unemployment rate in the short term.\n\n- **Calculation Method Changes:** Adjustments in how the unemployment rate is calculated—such as excluding students—have affected reported figures. Future methodological changes could again alter the rate, but absent specific information on such changes, it's reasonable to base the forecast on current methods.\n\n- **Projections:** Long-term projections indicated that the youth unemployment rate might trend around 18.5% in 2025, suggesting that rates around 18.0%-19.0% are plausible for October 2024.\n\n- **External Factors:** Global economic conditions, including slowdowns in key markets and geopolitical tensions, could negatively impact China's economy, potentially keeping youth unemployment rates elevated.\n\nConsidering these factors, there is a moderate probability that the youth unemployment rate for October 2024 will be greater than 18.0% and less than or equal to 19.0%.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 60%**",
