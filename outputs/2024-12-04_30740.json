    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the US national average retail price of regular gasoline be greater than $3.080 for the week of December 9, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-04\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports Weekly U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Price of greater than $3.080 for the week of December 9, 2024.  The resolution source can be accessed through [this link](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epmr_pte_nus_dpg&f=w). If the value is less than or equal to that amount, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf data from US EIA is not available, Metaculus may select a similar source of data or annul the question at their discretion. If EIA changes its reporting weeks, the week closest to the date mentioned in the Resolution Criteria will be used.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to [EIA](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gas_proc-methods.php), \"Every Monday, EIA collects information on retail prices for regular, midgrade, and premium grades of gasoline from a sample of retail gasoline outlets across the United States using Form EIA-878, Motor Gasoline Price Survey Schedule A. The weekly survey is designed to collect data on the cash price offered at the pump (including taxes) to consumers for each grade of gasoline. The data collected represent the price as of 8:00 a.m. local time on Monday, for the self-serve price except in areas having only full-serve, and the cash price except for outlets accepting only credit cards.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will be greater than $3.080 for the week of December 9, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Prices\nAs of November 25, 2024, the national average price for regular gasoline was $3.166 per gallon, which is already above the $3.080 threshold[4].\n\n## Recent Trends\nGas prices have been relatively stable, with a slight decrease from the previous week. The price dropped by -0.06% from the week before, indicating a minor fluctuation[4].\n\n## Historical and Forecasted Trends\nGasBuddy and other sources predict that gas prices will generally remain lower in 2024 compared to 2022 and 2023, but there can be monthly variations. For example, prices peaked in April 2024 at $3.61 per gallon and have since decreased to around $3.14 per gallon in October 2024[1][2].\n\n## Seasonal Factors\nGas prices typically follow seasonal patterns, with prices often increasing during the spring and summer months due to higher demand. However, since the question pertains to December, which is a winter month, prices are generally expected to be lower or stable during this period[3].\n\n## External Factors\nSeveral external factors can influence gas prices, including global conflicts, weather events, and decisions by OPEC+. However, as of the current data, there is no indication of a significant event that would cause a sharp increase in the immediate future[1][3].\n\nGiven these points, it is likely that the national average retail price of regular gasoline will remain above $3.080 for the week of December 9, 2024, based on the current trends and prices.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe answer to whether the US national average retail price of regular gasoline will be greater than $3.080 for the week of December 9, 2024, is likely \"yes\" based on the current data and trends. However, gas prices can be volatile and subject to various influences, so this prediction is made with the understanding that unexpected events could alter the outcome.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an expected increase in gasoline demand during the week of December 9, 2024, compared to the previous weeks?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about gasoline demand for the week of December 9, 2024. The sources discuss natural gas demand and prices, as well as broader energy market trends, but do not address gasoline demand specifically for that week.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OPEC+ announced any changes to oil production levels in the month of December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, OPEC+ has announced changes to oil production levels for the month of December 2024. Specifically, they have decided to delay a planned increase in oil output that was originally scheduled for December. Instead, the increase will now start from January 2025 at the earliest. This decision was made due to weak demand and economic concerns[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are US refineries operating at full capacity without any planned shutdowns for maintenance during December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about planned shutdowns for maintenance at US refineries during December 2024. The sources provide data on refinery capacity, utilization rates, and the number of active refineries, but they do not include details on scheduled maintenance or shutdowns for the specific month of December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the national average retail price of regular gasoline increased in the week leading up to December 4, 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe national average retail price of regular gasoline has not increased in the week leading up to December 4, 2024. According to the AAA Fuel Prices data, the current average price as of December 4, 2024, is $3.037, which is slightly lower than the average price of $3.047 from the previous day and $3.067 from a week ago[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant global conflict or geopolitical event since November 25, 2024, that could impact oil prices?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about significant global conflicts or geopolitical events that have occurred since November 25, 2024, that could impact oil prices. The sources primarily discuss anticipated events, ongoing tensions, and general geopolitical trends up to November 2024, but they do not provide real-time or post-November 25, 2024, updates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent regulatory changes in the US that could influence retail gasoline prices in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of recent regulatory changes specifically implemented or planned for December 2024 that would influence retail gasoline prices. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources discuss various factors affecting gasoline prices, such as global oil market conditions, seasonal demand, refinery operations, and existing regulations, but they do not mention new or recent regulatory changes for December 2024[1][2][5].\n- There are discussions about past and ongoing policies, such as the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) and environmental regulations, but these are not new changes for December 2024[1].\n- The focus is more on seasonal and market-driven factors rather than new regulatory changes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent changes to US fuel taxes that could affect gasoline prices in December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent changes to US fuel taxes that could affect gasoline prices in December 2024.\n\n1. **Illinois Motor Fuel Tax Rate Changes**: Effective July 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024, the Motor Fuel Use Tax rates in Illinois have been updated. For gasoline, the combined rate is 66.6¢ per gallon (47.0¢ for Part A and 19.6¢ for Part B)[1][2].\n\n2. **Annual Adjustment**: The Illinois Motor Fuel Tax Law includes an annual increase based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the 12 months ending in March of each year. For July 1, 2024, this increase is 3.49%[2].\n\n3. **Federal Tax Rates**: While federal motor fuel tax rates have not changed recently, they remain at 18.4¢ per gallon for gasoline and 24.4¢ per gallon for diesel as of the current information[3][5].\n\nThese changes, particularly the updated state tax rates and the annual CPI adjustment, can impact gasoline prices in December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major weather events forecasted for December 2024 that could disrupt oil refining or distribution?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the relevant forecasts for December 2024 that could potentially disrupt oil refining or distribution:\n\n## Snowfall and Cold Temperatures\n- Forecasts indicate a La Niña event, which is expected to bring colder-than-average conditions to the north-central Plains and northern United States. This could lead to increased snowfall in areas such as the northwestern United States, the upper Midwest, and parts of the Northeast[1][2].\n- While snow and cold temperatures can disrupt transportation and infrastructure, they are not specifically mentioned as targeting major oil refining or distribution areas.\n\n## Precipitation and Storms\n- There is a prediction of wetter-than-average conditions in the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes region, which could lead to flooding or other precipitation-related issues. However, these areas are not typically highlighted as major oil refining or distribution hubs[2].\n\n## General Weather Patterns\n- The forecasts do not specifically mention any severe weather events in December 2024 that would directly target major oil refining or distribution areas. The primary focus is on temperature and precipitation patterns rather than specific disruptive events like hurricanes or severe storms that could impact oil infrastructure.\n\nGiven the information available, there are no specific major weather events forecasted for December 2024 that are directly indicated to disrupt oil refining or distribution.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the supply of crude oil in the US and globally stable with no reported shortages as of December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the stability and presence of shortages in crude oil supply as of December 2024 can be assessed as follows:\n\n- Globally, the EIA and IEA reports indicate that while there are reductions in global oil inventories, there is no clear indication of immediate shortages. Instead, there are expectations of inventory decreases due to various factors such as OPEC+ production cuts and global demand dynamics[1][3][5].\n- The EIA forecasts suggest that global oil inventories are falling, but this is part of the expected market dynamics rather than an indication of a shortage. Global oil production is expected to meet or slightly exceed demand in 2024 and 2025, with some fluctuations due to factors like OPEC+ policies and non-OPEC+ supply growth[1][3][5].\n- In the US, crude oil production is expected to continue at significant levels, with forecasts indicating an average of around 13.2-13.3 million barrels per day in 2024, which is up from the previous year. There is no mention of shortages in US crude oil supply[1][3][4].\n\nGiven this information, it appears that there are no reported shortages in crude oil supply as of December 2024, both in the US and globally.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the national average retail price of regular gasoline as of November 25, 2024, greater than $3.080 per gallon?\nANSWER: To determine if the national average retail price of regular gasoline as of November 25, 2024, is greater than $3.080 per gallon, we can refer to the following sources:\n\n1. **AAA Fuel Prices**: This source provides current and historical gas prices but does not specify the exact date of November 25, 2024. However, it gives recent averages that can be used as a reference[1].\n\n2. **United States Gas Price History**: This source lists the average regular gasoline prices for various regions and the national average. As of November 25, 2024, the national average regular gasoline price is listed as $3.4710[2].\n\n3. **U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Data**: The EIA data also provides historical prices, but the specific date of November 25, 2024, is not explicitly mentioned in the tables. However, the FRED data from the St. Louis Fed, which is based on EIA data, shows a price of $2.958 for November 2024, but this is a monthly average and not specifically for November 25[5].\n\nGiven the information from the **United States Gas Price History**, the national average regular gasoline price as of November 25, 2024, is $3.4710, which is greater than $3.080 per gallon.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until resolution:** 5 days (from December 4, 2024, to December 9, 2024).\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:** Yes, the national average retail price of regular gasoline would remain greater than $3.080.\n\n(c) **Forecast with a quarter of the time left (approximately 1 day):** Probability would remain high, around 90%.\n\n(d) **Forecast with four times the time left (20 days):** Probability slightly decreases but remains strong, around 85%.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 25, 2024, the national average retail price for regular gasoline was $3.166 per gallon, already exceeding the $3.080 threshold. Recent trends indicate a slight decrease in prices, but the overall level remains above the specified amount. December being a winter month typically sees stable or slightly lower gasoline prices due to reduced demand compared to summer months.\n\nKey factors supporting the likelihood of the price remaining above $3.080 include:\n\n- **OPEC+ Decision:** With OPEC+ delaying the increase in oil output until January 2025, the supply side remains relatively constrained, supporting higher prices.\n  \n- **Stable Crude Oil Supply:** Both US and global crude oil supplies appear stable with no reported shortages, reducing the risk of significant price drops.\n  \n- **Regulatory Factors:** Recent changes in state fuel taxes, such as those in Illinois, can contribute to maintaining or slightly increasing gasoline prices.\n  \n- **Absence of Major Disruptions:** There are no significant geopolitical conflicts or severe weather events forecasted that could disrupt oil refining or distribution in the immediate timeframe.\n\nWhile there is a slight downward trend in prices and potential minor fluctuations, the short time frame of 5 days limits the impact of these factors. Therefore, the probability that the national average retail price of regular gasoline will be greater than $3.080 for the week of December 9, 2024, remains high.\n\n**Probability:** 90%",
