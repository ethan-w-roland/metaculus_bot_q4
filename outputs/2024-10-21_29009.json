{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Doug Pederson cease to be the Jacksonville Jaguars head coach before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before January 1, 2025, Doug Pederson is no longer head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) such as the official Jaguars website [coaches page](https://www.jaguars.com/team/coaches-roster/). Otherwise this question resolves as **No.**\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAfter an early losing streak to begin the 2024-25 NFL season, some have [speculated](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/will-doug-pederson-get-fired-jaguars-coach-hot-seat/8e9d16305862870ef416857f) that Pederson might be fired by Jaguars owner Shad Khan, although the question might be timing. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Doug Pederson ceasing to be the Jacksonville Jaguars' head coach before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Current Performance and Expectations\n- The Jaguars started the 2024 season poorly, going 0-3, which led to significant pressure on Pederson and the team. However, they recently secured a crucial 32-16 victory over the New England Patriots, which provided some relief but also highlighted the need for consistent performance.\n\n## Team and Owner Expectations\n- The Jaguars were touted by owner Shad Khan as the best team in franchise history before the season, with high expectations for immediate success. This increases the pressure on Pederson to deliver wins, especially given the challenging schedule ahead.\n\n## Coaching Record and Stability\n- Pederson has a history of turning teams around, as seen in his first season with the Jaguars where they finished 9-8 and won their division after a poor start. However, the current season's performance has been inconsistent, and the margin for error is very thin.\n\n## Immediate Schedule and Challenges\n- The Jaguars face a tough upcoming schedule, including games against the Green Bay Packers, Philadelphia Eagles, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions. The need to duplicate their recent victory and maintain a high level of performance is critical to Pederson's job security.\n\n## Owner and Organizational Patience\n- While Pederson has achieved some success with the Jaguars, the owner's high expectations and the team's current performance could influence decisions regarding his tenure. However, there is no clear indication yet that the organization is ready to make a change.\n\nGiven these points, it is not immediately clear whether Doug Pederson will cease to be the head coach before January 1, 2025. The decision would depend on the team's performance over the next few weeks and how the organization responds to any further setbacks or successes. The pressure is high, but Pederson's past achievements and the recent win suggest he still has some leeway, though it is precarious.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Doug Pederson achieved a winning record in his most recent season with the Jacksonville Jaguars?\nANSWER: NO\n\nAs of the current season in 2024, Doug Pederson's Jacksonville Jaguars have a record of 2-5, which is not a winning record.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Doug Pederson have a contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars that extends beyond January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit information about the specific duration of Doug Pederson's contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars beyond January 1, 2025.

Here are some key points:\n\n- NFL insider Jordan Schultz has reported that the Jaguars' locker room is \"gone\" regarding Pederson, and there is internal support eroding.\n- There are discussions about Pederson potentially being the first NFL coach fired in the 2024 season due to the team's dismal performance.\n- Pete Prisco of CBS Sports believes that Pederson could be fired if the Jaguars lose to the New England Patriots in Week 7.\n- The owner, Shad Khan, is described as being very angry with the team's performance, which suggests his patience with Pederson may be wearing thin.\n\nThese reports and analyses from various media outlets indicate significant speculation about Pederson's future as the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the Jacksonville Jaguars' upcoming opponents in the 2024 NFL season considered strong contenders?\nANSWER: To determine if the Jacksonville Jaguars' upcoming opponents in the 2024 NFL season are considered strong contenders, we need to look at the records and standings of their opponents from the previous season.\n\nHere are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The Jaguars will play teams from the AFC East, NFC North, and other specific teams from different divisions. This includes several teams that had strong performances in the 2023 season.\n- Their opponents include three 2023 division champions: Houston Texans, Buffalo Bills, and Detroit Lions. Additionally, they will face other 2023 playoff teams such as the Green Bay Packers, Cleveland Browns, Miami Dolphins, and Philadelphia Eagles.\n- The schedule includes teams with notable records from the 2023 season, such as the Detroit Lions (12-5), Miami Dolphins (11-6), Buffalo Bills (11-6), and Philadelphia Eagles (11-6).\n\nGiven that many of their opponents were division champions or playoff teams in the 2023 season, it is reasonable to conclude that the Jacksonville Jaguars' upcoming opponents in the 2024 NFL season are indeed considered strong contenders.\n\nYES", "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- Approximately 72 days remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- If nothing changes, Doug Pederson would **remain** the head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars by January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- With about 18 days remaining, the probability of Doug Pederson ceasing to be the head coach would be approximately **25%**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- If there were 288 days remaining, the probability would increase to around **70%**.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe current date is October 21, 2024, with approximately 72 days until January 1, 2025. Doug Pederson's position as head coach is under significant scrutiny due to the Jaguars' poor start to the season (2-5 record) and high expectations set by owner Shad Khan. Despite a recent victory against the Patriots, the team's inconsistency and challenging upcoming schedule exacerbate the pressure on Pederson.\n\n**Current Performance and Organizational Pressure:**\n- The Jaguars' 2-5 record places Pederson in a precarious position, especially given the high expectations for this season.\n- Owner Shad Khan has publicly emphasized that this is the best team in franchise history, increasing the stakes for immediate success.\n- Media speculation and internal reports suggest diminishing support for Pederson within the organization, heightening the likelihood of a coaching change if performance does not improve.\n\n**Time Sensitivity:**\n- With 72 days remaining, there is moderate time to observe performance improvements. However, the NFL season's midpoint suggests that significant changes could occur if the team fails to turn its fortunes around.\n- If only 18 days were left, the window for making a decision would be narrow, reducing the probability of a change unless there were an immediate and severe downturn.\n- Conversely, with 288 days, there would be ample opportunity for sustained performance issues to lead to a coaching change, thus increasing the probability.\n\n**Base Rates and Historical Context:**\n- Historically, NFL teams with a similar start to the season often reconsider their coaching staff, especially under high-pressure ownership.\n- Doug Pederson's prior success in turning teams around provides him some leverage, but the current performance may override his past achievements.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\nConsidering the current mediocre performance, high expectations, media speculation, and the relatively limited time remaining in the season, there is a substantial risk that Doug Pederson could be relieved of his duties before January 1, 2025. However, his prior success and the potential for the team to rally some late-season wins provide a counterbalance to this risk.\n\n**Probability: 55%**", "probability": 55}
