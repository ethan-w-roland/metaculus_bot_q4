    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill China's youth unemployment rate be less than or equal to 17.0 for October 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-07\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve based on the youth unemployment rate for October 2024, as reported by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/youth-unemployment-rate), using data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\r\nThe question will resolve based on the reported youth unemployment rate, rounded to the nearest 0.1 percentage point.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe youth unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force aged 16-24 without work but available for and seeking employment, based on the calculation method used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China as of August 2024.\r\n\r\nIf the National Bureau of Statistics of China revises its calculation method or age range for the youth unemployment rate before September 2024, the question will be resolved using the most up-to-date definition and methodology.\r\n\r\nIn the event that Trading Economics does not report the youth unemployment rate for August 2024 before October 7, 2024, or if the data is not available from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the question will resolve as \"Annulled\". The data can be found [directly from the NBS here](https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=A01) by selecting \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate\" under \"Indicators\" on the left side and observing the data in the row labeled \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate of the Population Aged from 16 to 24 Excluding Students(%)\".\n\nBACKGROUND:\nChina's youth unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people aged 16 to 24 who are not in school and are unemployed, has been a growing concern for the country's policymakers and economists. In July 2024, the rate [soared to 17.1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/chinas-youth-unemployment-soars-above-17percent-in-july.html), the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December 2023.\r\n\r\nThe new calculation method, introduced in late 2023, excludes those who are still in school, as more people in China are pursuing higher education amid a more competitive job market. Under the previous calculation method, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023.\r\n\r\nThe rising youth unemployment rate has been attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes in the labor market. As the issue continues to draw attention, this question aims to predict the youth unemployment rate for August 2024, providing insight into the short-term trajectory of this critical economic indicator.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether China's youth unemployment rate will be less than or equal to 17.0% for October 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends\n- The youth unemployment rate in China has been volatile, with a recent high of 18.8% in August 2024 and a slight decrease to 17.6% in September 2024.\n\n## Economic Context\n- China is experiencing an economic slowdown, which has significantly impacted the job market, particularly for young graduates. Key sectors such as real estate, finance, and IT, which traditionally employ many recent graduates, have seen significant declines.\n- The overall urban unemployment rate has also risen, indicating broader economic challenges.\n\n## Policy and Hiring Practices\n- Stringent hiring practices and the costs associated with terminating employees in China have made companies hesitant to hire new graduates. This has contributed to the high youth unemployment rate.\n\n## Projections and Expectations\n- According to Trading Economics, the youth unemployment rate is expected to be around 20.0% by the end of the current quarter, and in the long-term, it is projected to trend around 18.5% in 2025 and 18.0% in 2026.\n\nGiven these points, while there has been a slight improvement in the youth unemployment rate from August to September, the overall economic conditions and hiring practices suggest that a significant drop below 17.0% in October 2024 might be challenging. However, the exact figure for October 2024 is not yet available, and these projections are based on current trends and economic indicators.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The answer to whether China's youth unemployment rate will be less than or equal to 17.0% for October 2024 is not immediately clear based on the available data.\n- The current trends and economic context suggest it might be difficult to achieve such a reduction, but without the actual data for October, it is speculative to make a definitive prediction.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were there major negative events in China during October 2024 that could increase youth unemployment?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about major negative events in China during October 2024 that could increase youth unemployment. The sources discuss various economic and policy challenges facing China, but they do not provide details on specific events in October 2024 that would directly impact youth unemployment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the National Bureau of Statistics of China released the youth unemployment rate data for October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of the National Bureau of Statistics of China releasing the youth unemployment rate data for October 2024. The latest data mentioned in the sources is for September 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Trading Economics reported China's youth unemployment rate for October 2024 as less than or equal to 17.0%?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not include the specific data for China's youth unemployment rate for October 2024. The most recent data available in the sources is for September 2024, where the youth unemployment rate was 17.60%. There is no information given for October 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China's youth unemployment rate been decreasing in the months leading up to October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the youth unemployment rate in China has shown a mixed trend but does indicate a decrease in the immediate months leading up to October 2024.\n\n- In August 2024, the youth unemployment rate was 18.8%.\n- In September 2024, it decreased to 17.6%.\n\nTherefore, there was a decrease from August to September, which are the months leading up to October 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did China's GDP growth rate improve in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter?\nANSWER: No, China's GDP growth rate did not improve in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter.\n\n- The GDP grew by 4.7% in the second quarter, but only by 4.6% in the third quarter on a year-on-year basis.\n- Additionally, the quarter-on-quarter growth was 0.7% in Q2 and 0.9% in Q3, but this does not indicate an improvement in the year-on-year growth rate, which is the relevant comparison here.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Was China's youth unemployment rate for September 2024 less than or equal to 17.0%?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, China's youth unemployment rate for September 2024 was 17.6%, which is greater than 17.0%.\n\n- The source from Trading Economics states that the youth unemployment rate in China decreased to 17.60 percent in September 2024.\n- The South China Morning Post also reports that the September jobless rate for the 16-24 age group dipped to 17.6 percent.\n\nTherefore, the youth unemployment rate for September 2024 was not less than or equal to 17.0%.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been changes in the methodology used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China to calculate the youth unemployment rate before October 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been changes in the methodology used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China to calculate the youth unemployment rate before October 2024.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) suspended the release of youth unemployment data for six months to reevaluate and improve its calculation methods. The new methodology, implemented in January 2024, excludes university students from the youth unemployment rate calculations.\n\nThis change was made to address issues with the previous methodology and to provide a more accurate representation of the unemployment rate among young people who are not in school.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major industries in China increased hiring of young workers in recent months leading up to October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that major industries in China have not significantly increased the hiring of young workers in recent months leading up to October 2024.\n\n- The youth unemployment rate in China has remained high, with figures rising to 18.8% in August 2024, indicating ongoing challenges for young job seekers.\n- Industries that typically employ young workers, such as real estate, finance, and information technology, have experienced significant declines, making it harder for recent graduates to secure well-paying positions.\n- While there has been some increase in job openings in service-related sectors like transportation, logistics, and tourism, the overall trend suggests that the job market for young workers remains challenging due to economic slowdown, regulatory burdens, and cultural pressures.\n\nTherefore, the evidence does not support a significant increase in hiring of young workers in major industries in recent months.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Were significant economic policies implemented by the Chinese government between September and October 2024 to reduce youth unemployment?\nANSWER: The sources provided indicate that the Chinese government implemented several economic policies between September and October 2024, but they do not specifically focus on reducing youth unemployment.\n\n- The policies announced include monetary measures such as cutting interest rates, reducing mortgage rates, and lowering reserve requirements for banks to facilitate cheaper borrowing and support the property sector.\n- Fiscal measures include allocating 200 billion yuan ($28 billion) for local government investment projects and plans for issuing bonds to finance local government debt and enhance the social safety net.\n- There were also announcements about supporting recent graduates struggling to find jobs, such as rare cash handouts to disadvantaged citizens and subsidies for recent graduates, but these are not detailed as the primary focus of the stimulus packages.\n\nWhile these measures aim to boost the overall economy and may indirectly benefit youth employment, they are not specifically targeted at reducing youth unemployment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have global economic conditions improved significantly in late 2024 in a way that could positively affect China's youth employment?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the improvement in global economic conditions in late 2024 is mixed and does not clearly indicate a significant positive impact on China's youth employment.\n\n- The OECD report suggests that the global economy is turning the corner with declining inflation and robust trade growth, but it also highlights significant risks, including geopolitical tensions and the impact of tight monetary policy.\n- The World Bank report indicates that global growth is stabilizing but at a level that is weak by recent historical standards. While growth in some regions is expected to improve, it is still below pre-COVID-19 levels, and developing economies, including China, face various challenges such as subdued consumer demand and ongoing corrections in the real estate sector.\n- The IMF report notes stable but underwhelming global growth, with various risks and challenges, including geopolitical tensions and disruptions in specific sectors. It does mention upgrades to the forecast for emerging Asia, driven by investments in artificial intelligence and electronics, but this does not specifically address youth employment in China.\n\nGiven these points, while there are some positive signs in global economic trends, such as declining inflation and stabilizing growth, the overall outlook does not clearly indicate a significant improvement that would specifically and positively affect China's youth employment.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a)** **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nApproximately **one week**. The National Bureau of Statistics of China typically releases unemployment data around the middle of the following month. Since today's date is November 7, 2024, the data for October 2024 is expected to be released around **November 15, 2024**.\n\n---\n\n**(b)** **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed from the last reported figure, the youth unemployment rate would remain at **17.6%** (the rate for September 2024). This is **above 17.0%**, so the question would resolve as **\"No\"**.\n\n---\n\n**(c)** **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only **a couple of days** left until the data release, there would be limited opportunity for significant economic changes. Given the decreasing trend but considering potential seasonal adjustments and economic fluctuations, I would estimate a **moderate probability** that the rate could fall to **17.0% or slightly below**, but uncertainty remains high.\n\n---\n\n**(d)** **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were **approximately four weeks** left until the outcome is known, there would be more time for economic policies to take effect and for industries to adjust hiring practices. Given this extended period, I would be **more optimistic** about the rate decreasing below **17.0%**, but external factors and economic challenges could still influence the outcome.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe youth unemployment rate in China has shown a **declining trend** in recent months:\n\n- **August 2024:** 18.8%\n- **September 2024:** 17.6% (a decrease of 1.2 percentage points)\n\nIf this **decreasing trend** continues, it's plausible that the rate for **October 2024** could further decline by **0.6 percentage points** to reach **17.0%**.\n\nSeveral factors support this possibility:\n\n1. **Recent Decreases:** The substantial drop from August to September suggests efforts to reduce unemployment are having an impact.\n2. **Government Policies:** While significant new policies specifically targeting youth unemployment were **unclear**, ongoing economic stimulus measures may indirectly contribute to job creation.\n3. **Seasonal Hiring:** October may benefit from seasonal hiring in preparation for year-end activities, which could temporarily boost employment among youth.\n\nHowever, there are also factors introducing uncertainty:\n\n1. **Economic Slowdown:** China's GDP growth rate did not improve in Q3 2024 compared to Q2 2024, indicating persistent economic challenges.\n2. **Industry Hesitation:** Major industries have not significantly increased hiring of young workers, limiting opportunities for reducing youth unemployment.\n3. **Global Conditions:** Unclear improvements in global economic conditions may dampen external demand, affecting China's economy.\n\nConsidering these factors, there's a **reasonable probability** that the youth unemployment rate for October 2024 will be **less than or equal to 17.0%**, but it's not certain. The decreasing trend is a positive sign, but economic headwinds could limit further reductions.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
