    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Ghana declare a winner in its presidential election before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Electoral Commission of Ghana](https://ec.gov.gh/election-results/) declares a winner of the 2024 presidential election of Ghana before January 1, 2025. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**. \n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Ghana’s December 2024 elections put the resilience of the country’s vaunted democracy to the test](https://afripoli.org/ghanas-december-2024-elections-put-the-resilience-of-the-countrys-vaunted-democracy-to-the-test) | [Ghana 2024 Elections: A Risk Assessment of the Online Information Space](https://www.iri.org/resources/ghana-2024-elections-a-risk-assessment-of-the-online-information-space/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Ghana will declare a winner in its presidential election before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Election Date and Process\nThe presidential and parliamentary elections in Ghana are scheduled for December 7, 2024. The electoral system follows a two-round system, where a candidate must secure at least 50 percent plus one vote to win in the first round. If no candidate achieves this majority, a runoff election will be held between the top two candidates[3][4].\n\n## Historical Context and Electoral Timelines\nIn previous elections, Ghana has generally managed to declare winners within a reasonable timeframe. For instance, the 2020 presidential election results were announced shortly after the election, despite some disputes and legal challenges[3].\n\n## Potential for Runoff\nGiven the competitive nature of the election, with the main contest expected between the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the National Democratic Congress (NDC), there is a possibility of a runoff if no candidate secures a majority in the first round. The runoff is scheduled for December 28, 2024, if necessary[3][4].\n\n## Institutional Integrity and Efficiency\nGhana's Electoral Commission has a reputation for professionalism, independence, and integrity. This, combined with the country's history of relatively smooth electoral processes and the involvement of civil society and international observers, suggests that the commission is likely to manage the election and any subsequent runoff efficiently[2][3].\n\n## Conclusion\nConsidering the scheduled dates and the efficiency of Ghana's electoral processes, it is likely that the winner of the presidential election will be declared before January 1, 2025. Even if a runoff is required, it is set for December 28, 2024, which would still allow for the declaration of a winner before the end of the year. However, any unforeseen delays or disputes could potentially extend the timeline, but based on current information, a declaration before January 1, 2025, appears probable.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the 2024 Ghana presidential election take place on December 7, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe 2024 Ghanaian general election, which includes the presidential election, is scheduled to take place on December 7, 2024, as indicated in multiple sources[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the runoff election scheduled to be held on December 28, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe runoff election dates mentioned in the sources are December 14, 2024, for Texas[1], and December 3, 2024, for Georgia[2][3], but neither source indicates a runoff election scheduled for December 28, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Electoral Commission of Ghana officially declared the presidential election results as of December 5, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nAs of December 5, 2024, the presidential election in Ghana has not yet taken place, as it is scheduled for December 7, 2024. Therefore, the Electoral Commission of Ghana has not declared any presidential election results[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Electoral Commission of Ghana announced the official date for declaring the winner of the 2024 presidential election?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specify an exact date for declaring the winner of the 2024 presidential election in Ghana. While they mention the election date as December 7, 2024, and the schedule for media briefings until the presidential results are declared, they do not give a specific date for the declaration of the winner[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have international observers confirmed the integrity and efficiency of the 2024 Ghana presidential election process?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not include any confirmation from international observers about the integrity and efficiency of the 2024 Ghana presidential election process. While they detail the deployment and mandate of the Commonwealth Observer Group and other preparations for the election, they do not contain the observers' final assessments or conclusions regarding the integrity and efficiency of the election process. The observers are scheduled to be in Ghana from November 28 to December 14, and their findings would be reported after the election[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Electoral Commission of Ghana operating without significant disruptions or delays as of December 5, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of significant disruptions or delays in the operations of the Electoral Commission of Ghana as of December 5, 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss the preparations and confidence in the upcoming elections, with no mention of disruptions or delays[1][2][3].\n- The Electoral Commission's website and other reports suggest that the necessary steps, such as voter registration, ballot paper printing, and security measures, are being taken without any noted issues[1][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did any candidate secure more than 50% of the votes in the first round of the 2024 Ghana presidential election?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nAs of the provided sources, there are predictions and projections about the outcome of the 2024 Ghana presidential election, but there is no actual result or confirmation of the election's outcome. For example, local research firm Global InfoAnalytics predicts a first-round victory for John Mahama with 52.2% of the vote, but these are just predictions and not the actual results of the election[1][4].\n\nTo determine if any candidate secured more than 50% of the votes in the first round, the actual election results would need to be available, which they are not in the provided sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is a runoff election required for the 2024 Ghana presidential election?\nANSWER: A runoff election is not necessarily required but is a possibility for the 2024 Ghana presidential election. Here are the details:\n\n- The presidential election in Ghana uses a two-round system. A candidate must obtain more than 50% of the valid votes cast to win in the first round[2][3][4].\n- If no candidate secures more than 50% of the votes in the initial round, a runoff election between the two candidates with the highest number of votes must be held within 21 days of the first election[2][3][4].\n\nTherefore, a runoff election is required only if no candidate achieves a majority in the first round.\n\n**YES**, a runoff election is required if no candidate secures more than 50% of the votes in the first round.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there no credible reports of electoral fraud affecting the outcome of the 2024 Ghana presidential election?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nWhile the sources provided discuss various issues and risks associated with the 2024 Ghana presidential election, such as allegations of electoral tampering, voter registry errors, and the potential for disputes over election results, they do not provide a definitive conclusion on whether electoral fraud has affected the outcome of the 2024 election.\n\n- The opposition party, the National Democratic Congress (NDC), has alleged electoral tampering and called for an independent audit, but the outcome of these allegations and any potential impact on the election results are not yet determined[1].\n- The election process and results are expected to be contested, but this does not confirm whether fraud has occurred or affected the outcome[2][3].\n- There is no final assessment or conclusion from the sources on the actual occurrence or impact of electoral fraud on the 2024 presidential election outcome.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major disputes or legal challenges regarding the 2024 Ghana presidential election results?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, while the 2024 Ghana presidential election has not yet taken place (it is scheduled for December 7, 2024), there are significant indications of potential disputes and legal challenges that could arise regarding the election results.\n\n- Former President John Dramani Mahama has stated that he will not accept the results if the process is marred by violence and irregularities, which suggests a potential for dispute if such conditions are met[1].\n- The National Democratic Congress (NDC) has raised concerns about the electoral process, including the integrity of the voters’ register and potential bias on the part of the Electoral Commission (EC) and the judiciary. They have also announced an intention to boycott the courts if the presidential elections go against them, citing suspected partisan bias[3].\n- There are heightened tensions and mutual antagonism between the NDC and the New Patriotic Party (NPP), with each party believing that the other could only win through electoral malpractice. This has created an environment where disputes and legal challenges are highly likely[3][4].\n\nGiven these pre-election concerns and tensions, it is clear that the groundwork for potential major disputes or legal challenges regarding the 2024 Ghana presidential election results has been laid.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\nAs of December 5, 2024, there are **23 days** left until the latest possible date for declaring the election winner. The presidential election is scheduled for December 7, 2024, with a potential runoff on December 28, 2024. Therefore, the outcome will be known by December 28, 2024, well before January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\nIf current conditions remain stable:\n- The Electoral Commission of Ghana is expected to declare the election results promptly after the December 7, 2024, election.\n- Given Ghana's history of efficient and transparent electoral processes, it is highly likely that a winner will be declared before January 1, 2025.\n  \n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\nIf only a quarter of the time (approximately 6 days) were left:\n- The likelihood of the Electoral Commission declaring a winner within this shortened timeframe remains high due to Ghana's efficient electoral processes.\n- Even with a swift runoff, the timeframe is sufficient to declare results promptly.\n  \n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\nIf there were four times the time left (approximately 92 days):\n- This extended period would provide ample time for any unforeseen delays or disputes to be resolved.\n- However, given that the latest possible outcome is already within 23 days, extending the timeframe does not significantly alter the high probability of a timely declaration.\n  \n**Final Rationale:**\nGhana has a strong track record of conducting elections efficiently and declaring results promptly. The scheduled dates for the election and potential runoff are both well within the timeframe needed to resolve any issues before January 1, 2025. While there are always uncertainties in electoral processes, the institutional integrity and historical precedence in Ghana support a high probability that a winner will be declared within the stipulated period.\n\n**Probability: 95%**",
