The sources discuss upcoming missions and tests, such as the Starship Flight Test 7 targeted for January 11, 2025, and other planned launches and missions in 2025, but they do not mention any new major mission announcements scheduled before the start of 2025.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as there is no explicit information about planned announcements before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has SpaceX scheduled any launches between November 29, 2024, and January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, SpaceX has scheduled several launches between November 29, 2024, and January 1, 2025.\n\n- A Falcon 9 Block 5 launch for the Starlink Group 6-65 mission is scheduled for November 29, 2024[2][3].\n- There are multiple missions planned for November and December 2024, including the Astranis Block 2 Mission, WorldView Legion 5 & 6, Transporter 12, and others, although the exact dates within these months are not yet finalized[1][2].\n- The CRS SpX-32 mission is targeted for NET December 2024[2].\n\nThese indicate that there are indeed scheduled launches within the specified timeframe.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has SpaceX posted on its Updates page within the last six months?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is clear that SpaceX has been actively updating its launch schedules and mission details recently.\n\n- The SpaceX Stats page mentions upcoming launches, including one scheduled for November 30, 2024, which indicates recent updates[1].\n- The Space.com articles discuss recent and upcoming missions, such as the Crew-9 mission and Starship Flight 5, which suggest ongoing updates within the last six months[2][3].\n- The SpaceX launches page on the official SpaceX website also shows recent launch updates, including missions in November 2024, which confirms that updates have been posted within the last six months[5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is SpaceX actively working on the Starship development program as of November 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nAs of November 2024, SpaceX is actively engaged in the development of the Starship program. This is evident from several sources:\n\n- SpaceX has scheduled and conducted multiple test flights of the Starship, with the sixth test flight occurring on November 19, 2024[2][4].\n- The company is planning further test flights, including the upcoming seventh flight, and is working on accelerating the launch cadence for Starship[2][4][5].\n- SpaceX is also making incremental changes and improvements to the Starship and Super Heavy booster, such as testing new thermal protection materials, adjusting the launch time for daylight splashdown, and enhancing the booster's propulsion system[1][2].\n\nThese activities indicate ongoing and active development of the Starship program.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has SpaceX reported any delays or setbacks in its current projects since September 2024?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nSince September 2024, SpaceX has reported several delays and setbacks in its current projects. Here are some key points:\n\n- The fifth flight test of the Starship spacecraft, originally scheduled for mid-September, has been delayed to late November due to regulatory issues and additional environmental analysis requested by the FAA[1][3][4].\n\n- SpaceX experienced technical failures during the third quarter of 2024, including a Falcon 9 second stage anomaly, a Falcon 9 first stage landing failure, and an issue with the disposal burn of a Falcon 9 second stage after a mission to the International Space Station[2].\n\n- The company has also faced delays in its Falcon 9 launch schedule due to a deorbit issue during a mission to the ISS, which led to the grounding of Falcon 9 rockets until the root cause of the issue could be identified and resolved[3].\n\n- Regulatory challenges, particularly with the FAA, have been a significant hurdle, with SpaceX expressing frustration over the time-consuming and complex regulatory process[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has SpaceX received any new regulatory approvals from the FAA after September 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are indications of regulatory activities and approvals related to SpaceX after September 2024, although they may not be explicitly labeled as \"new regulatory approvals.\"\n\n1. **Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) for Starbase**: In November 2024, the FAA released a draft EA for Starship operations at Starbase, which includes approval for increasing the number of annual Starship launches and landings. This is a significant regulatory step, even though it is a draft and not a final approval[1].\n\n2. **Written Re-evaluation (WR) for Boca Chica Launch Site**: In October 2024, the FAA issued a WR that evaluated updates to various aspects of the Starship/Super Heavy operations, including the use of the deluge system, sonic boom coverage, and other operational changes. This WR concluded that no supplemental environmental analysis was needed, supporting the modification of SpaceX’s vehicle operator license[5].\n\nThese actions suggest that the FAA has been engaged in ongoing regulatory processes with SpaceX after September 2024, which could be considered as part of the process for receiving new or modified regulatory approvals.\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**  \n33 days (from November 29, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \n**No.** If current trends continue, SpaceX is expected to make at least one new post on its Updates page before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 8 days remaining, the probability that SpaceX would fail to make any new posts drops to **1%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith around 132 days remaining, the probability that SpaceX would fail to make any new posts diminishes further to **0.1%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**  \nSpaceX has a consistent history of regularly updating its website, especially during active phases of its projects. As of November 29, 2024, there are multiple scheduled launches and ongoing projects, such as the Starship development program and Starlink missions, which typically prompt new updates on the company's website. The recent organizational changes and regulatory activities further increase the likelihood of announcements or updates. Additionally, the background information indicates that there have been no significant technical issues affecting the Updates page's accessibility. Given the tight timeframe of just over a month, combined with the high activity level anticipated in the coming weeks, it is highly improbable that SpaceX would fail to make any new posts before the resolution date.\n\n**Probability:** 1%",
