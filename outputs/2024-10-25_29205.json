{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Russian government officially ban YouTube before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2025, the Russian government or its official agencies (e.g., Roskomnadzor, explained in the Fine Print) announce a complete ban on access to YouTube within Russia or implement technical measures that effectively block the platform nationwide. The resolution source will be the agencies themselves and/or reporting by other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe question will resolve as **No** if YouTube remains accessible in Russia, even with occasional slowdowns or regional outages, and no official ban is announced or implemented by the Russian government before January 1, 2025.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- The ban must be officially announced or implemented by the Russian government or its agencies. Statements by individual lawmakers or unofficial sources will not be considered for resolution.\n- Temporary or partial restrictions on YouTube, such as the blocking of specific channels or videos, will not count as a ban unless they effectively prevent access to the entire platform in Russia.\n- The announcement of the intention to ban YouTube is enough to resolve this question as Yes even if no specific implementation date is mentioned.\n\nWith Roskomnadzor, the state of blocking will be checked by entering the query `youtube.com` in the text field on Roskomnadzor's official [blocklist site](https://blocklist.rkn.gov.ru/) and submitting the form. (Please note that the blocklist might not be accessible outside of Russia and a few neighbouring countries without the use of a VPN.)\n\nIf the message returned is: \"\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043a \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435\" (access to the page is limited), this would mean that the site is in the blocklist and this question resolves as **Yes**.\n\nIf the message returned is: \"\u041f\u043e \u0412\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043c\u0443 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0443 \u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e\" (nothing has been found for your query), this would mean that the site is not included in the blocklist and this question resolves as No, as long as there are no other credible sources reporting an announcement or implementation of a ban.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAs Moscow has cracked down on independent Russian-language media since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, YouTube has remained a key platform for opposition figures and dissenting voices. However, recent reports of mass outages and slowdowns of the video-sharing platform in Russia have raised concerns about its future in the country.\n\nRussian lawmakers have [blamed Google](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/youtube-slowdown-russia-darkens-freedom-speech-outlook-2024-08-08/), which owns YouTube, for failing to upgrade its equipment in Russia since the invasion, leading to the slowdown that started in mid-July 2024. They claim that the degradation of service is a necessary step to persuade YouTube to reinstate blocked Russian channels. However, Google and technology experts dispute this explanation.\n\nA recent [Russian-language article](https://news.ru/russia/kogda-youtube-zarabotaet-normalno-v-rossii-chto-dlya-etogo-nuzhno/) discussed how this ban could still be in the works (translated by Google Translate):\n\n>According to the chairman of the Digital Economy Development Fund, German Klimenko, YouTube will be blocked in Russia in three to five months.\n\n>\"I think that testing is underway. YouTube's fate is probably predetermined, and it is similar to Instagram's fate (operations are prohibited in the Russian Federation). I would assume that YouTube will hang around for three to five months, and then be blocked,\" he said in a conversation with [aif.ru](https://aif.ru/society/web/-sudba-youtube-reshena-german-klimenko-o-durove-youtube-i-ii-v-seti).\n\nAdditionally:\n\n>Deputy Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Boris Chernyshov told NEWS.ru that large-scale work is currently underway to increase the capacity of Russian video hosting sites: Rutube, VK video and others, which should replace the American video hosting.\n\n>\"This can be seen from the strong advertising campaign of domestic services. And due to the decline in the quality of the YouTube service, which is currently working intermittently, many bloggers, presenters, and authors have begun to transfer their content to Russian platforms and duplicate all new releases there by default,\" Chernyshov said.\n\nHowever, Chernyshov subsequently [said](https://lenta.ru/news/2024/09/21/deputat-ob-yasnil-zayavlenie-o-polnoy-blokirovke-youtube-v-rossii/) he was misquoted.\n\nAs tensions between Russia and YouTube continue to escalate, this question aims to assess whether the Russian government will take the drastic step of officially banning the platform before January 1, 2025.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the Russian government officially banning YouTube before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Actions and Threats\n- The Russian government has been taking steps to restrict YouTube's functionality within Russia. Since July 2024, YouTube has been slowed down, and it only works on mobile devices, with indications that it may be completely blocked soon.\n- There have been ongoing tensions between the Russian government and YouTube, particularly over content related to the invasion of Ukraine. YouTube has banned Russian state-linked media channels globally, which has exacerbated the situation.\n\n## Official Statements\n- Despite the threats and actions to slow down YouTube, Russian Minister of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, Maksut Shadayev, stated in May 2024 that the government does not plan to ban YouTube. He emphasized the need for a competitive alternative before considering such a ban.\n\n## Historical Context\n- Russia has a history of blocking or restricting access to social media and online platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, which were banned in 2022. However, YouTube has remained accessible, albeit with increasing restrictions.\n\n## Base Rates and Trends\n- The Russian government has been tightening its control over the internet and media, particularly since the invasion of Ukraine. This trend suggests a continued effort to regulate and restrict access to information that contradicts the official narrative.\n\nGiven these points, while there are strong indications that the Russian government is moving towards stricter control over YouTube, the official statement from Minister Shadayev suggests that a complete ban might not be imminent unless a competitive alternative is available. However, the situation is fluid, and the government's actions can change rapidly.\n\n### Conclusion\n- The answer to whether the Russian government will officially ban YouTube before January 1, 2025, is not immediately clear. While there are significant restrictions and threats, official statements indicate a reluctance to ban YouTube without a suitable alternative. This ambiguity means that the outcome is uncertain and subject to change based on evolving circumstances.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is YouTube currently included in Roskomnadzor's official internet blocklist?\nANSWER: YouTube is not currently included in Roskomnadzor's official internet blocklist, although access to it is significantly restricted. The Russian authorities have deliberately reduced YouTube's loading speed to make it difficult for users to stream content efficiently, but the platform has not been completely blocked.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Russian authorities actively promoting domestic video platforms as alternatives to YouTube?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nRussian authorities are actively promoting domestic video platforms as alternatives to YouTube. This is evident from the promotion of platforms such as VK Video and RuTube, which are part of the Kremlin's efforts to reduce Russia's reliance on international platforms and strengthen its control over the information landscape within the country.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Russian government previously banned other major Western social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThe Russian government has previously taken actions to ban or restrict major Western social media platforms. In March 2022, a Russian court banned Facebook and Instagram, labeling their parent company Meta as \u201cextremist\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, Russia has implemented various restrictions and bans on other Western social media platforms. For example, in 2021, Russia restricted Twitter and ordered the blocking of Facebook for its \"discrimination toward Russian media\".\n\nThese actions are part of a broader pattern of censorship and restrictions on Western social media platforms in Russia.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant public opposition in Russia to the potential banning of YouTube?\nANSWER: Yes, there is significant public opposition in Russia to the potential banning or throttling of YouTube.\n\n- Reports indicate that Russians have threatened to take to the streets in protest over the recent YouTube slowdowns, which began in mid-July. Local authorities have even prevented some from organizing demonstrations, highlighting the public's discontent with the service disruptions.\n- Independent media outlets and Telegram channels have noted a readiness among Russians to protest the issue, with some officials also expressing dissent.\n- The opposition and independent media in Russia rely heavily on YouTube as a platform for expressing dissenting viewpoints and reaching audiences within Russia. The potential loss of this platform is seen as a significant blow to free expression and information dissemination.\n\nThese sources collectively indicate a strong public opposition to any measures that would restrict or ban YouTube in Russia.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have prominent Russian politicians or media figures recently advocated for banning YouTube?\nANSWER: While there are significant efforts by Russian authorities to throttle and restrict YouTube, the sources do not indicate that prominent Russian politicians or media figures have recently advocated for a complete ban on YouTube.\n\nInstead, the actions described involve slowing down YouTube's loading speeds and encouraging users to switch to domestic alternatives like VK Video and RuTube. Russian lawmakers, such as Alexander Khinshtein, have announced measures to reduce YouTube's performance, but these are framed as responses to YouTube's alleged violations of Russian law rather than calls for a total ban.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do Russian state media or government agencies currently use YouTube to disseminate information?\nANSWER: No, Russian state media or government agencies are no longer able to use YouTube to disseminate information in the same way they previously did. Here are the key points:\n\n- In March 2022, YouTube blocked Russian state-sponsored news channels globally, including those tied to RT and Sputnik.\n- YouTube has terminated over 230 channels affiliated with Kremlin-controlled outlets, and has blocked thousands of channels and millions of videos associated with Russian state media.\n- Recent actions by Meta and YouTube have further prohibited Russian state media outlets, including RT, from using their platforms due to foreign interference activities.\n\nTherefore, Russian state media and government agencies are no longer permitted to disseminate information through these platforms.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have high-ranking Russian officials recently indicated an intention to ban YouTube?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it appears that while Russian authorities have taken significant steps to throttle and disrupt YouTube's functionality in Russia, they have not explicitly indicated an intention to ban YouTube outright.\n\n- Russian authorities claim they have no plans to ban YouTube, instead attributing the platform's issues to \"aging infrastructure\" and technical problems, although they are deliberately slowing down YouTube playback speeds.\n- The actions taken, such as throttling YouTube speeds and threatening internet providers, are part of a broader effort to control and shape the Russian internet landscape, but a formal ban has not been announced.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has YouTube's functionality been significantly restricted or slowed down in Russia since mid-2024?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nSince mid-2024, YouTube's functionality in Russia has been significantly restricted and slowed down. Here are the key points:\n\n- Russian authorities have been throttling YouTube playback nationwide, reducing data transfer speeds to as low as 128 kilobits per second, making it difficult to stream videos except at very low resolutions[4|.\n- The slowdown, which began around early August, has made YouTube almost inaccessible without the use of a VPN.\n- The throttling is part of a broader effort by Russian authorities to isolate the internet and encourage users to migrate to Russian alternatives like RuTube and VKontakte.\n- Despite claims of technical issues, evidence suggests that Roskomnadzor, the Russian media regulator, is responsible for the slowdowns and restrictions.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the Russian government currently have the technical capability to effectively block YouTube nationwide?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that the Russian government has been developing and utilizing various technical capabilities to control and restrict access to YouTube, but whether they can effectively block it nationwide is still a matter of debate.\n\n- The Russian government has been using tools to throttle YouTube traffic, which involves deliberately slowing down the service to make it less usable. This has been achieved through measures such as reducing video playback speeds and using equipment to monitor and control internet traffic.\n- Russia's main media regulator, Roskomnadzor, has the capability to throttle traffic and has done so in the past with other platforms like Twitter. However, previous attempts at large-scale throttling have resulted in widespread disruptions to other internet services.\n- The technical infrastructure, including the Sovereign Internet system, has been developed to give the government more control over internet traffic. However, blocking YouTube entirely could have significant collateral effects on internet speeds across the country.\n\nGiven these points, while the Russian government has the technical capability to significantly disrupt YouTube's functionality, it is unclear if they can completely block it nationwide without causing broader internet disruptions. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Russian government recently passed laws or regulations that could make it easier to ban YouTube?\nANSWER: Yes, the Russian government has taken several steps and utilized existing legislation to make it easier to restrict or potentially ban YouTube.\n\n1. **Legislation from 2019**: The Russian regulator Roskomnadzor was granted the capability to throttle internet services through legislation amended in 2019. This has been used to slow down YouTube and other platforms that do not comply with Russian regulations.\n\n2. **Recent Measures**: Russian authorities have deliberately slowed down YouTube's loading speeds in response to Google's refusal to comply with Russian tech regulations. This action is part of a broader strategy to manage and control online content.\n\n3. **Law Banning Methods to Bypass Blockages**: In October 2023, a law was issued banning the promotion of methods to bypass blockages and the blocking of resources describing these methods. This law came into effect on May 1, 2024, further restricting users' ability to access blocked content, including YouTube if it were to be blocked in the future.\n\nThese measures and laws collectively indicate that the Russian government has created a legal and regulatory framework that could facilitate a complete ban on YouTube if they choose to do so.", "comment": "**(a) Time left until outcome:**\n\nThere are approximately **68 days** remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n**(b) Outcome if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends and conditions persist without significant changes, it is unlikely that the Russian government will officially ban YouTube before January 1, 2025. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast with a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about **17 days** remaining until the deadline, the probability of an official ban being announced would be lower due to the limited time frame. I would estimate the probability at around **5%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast with four times the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **272 days** remaining until the deadline (extending it to around July 2025), the longer time frame would increase the likelihood of an official ban. In that case, I would estimate the probability at around **30%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSeveral factors influence the probability of the Russian government officially banning YouTube before January 1, 2025:\n\n1. **Current Actions and Capabilities:**\n   - The Russian government has significantly throttled YouTube's functionality since mid-2024, slowing down playback speeds and making access difficult without a VPN.\n   - Russia has the technical capability and legal framework to block websites nationwide, as evidenced by previous bans on platforms like Facebook and Instagram.\n\n2. **Official Statements:**\n   - High-ranking officials have given mixed signals. While some have hinted at the possibility of YouTube being blocked within months, others, like the Minister of Digital Development, Maksut Shadayev, have stated there are no current plans to ban YouTube.\n   - Recent statements by officials suggest a strategic approach, focusing on promoting domestic alternatives before considering a full ban.\n\n3. **Promotion of Domestic Alternatives:**\n   - There is a concerted effort to develop and promote Russian platforms like RuTube and VK Video to replace YouTube.\n   - Successful migration to domestic platforms could make a ban on YouTube more feasible in the future.\n\n4. **Public Opposition and Practical Considerations:**\n   - There is significant public opposition to banning YouTube, as it remains a vital source of information and entertainment for many Russians.\n   - Banning YouTube could lead to public unrest and dissatisfaction, which the government may wish to avoid, especially in a short time frame.\n\n5. **Precedents with Other Platforms:**\n   - The Russian government has previously banned Western social media platforms, indicating a willingness to take such actions.\n   - However, those bans were often accompanied by immediate and pressing political motivations.\n\n6. **Time Constraints:**\n   - With only 68 days remaining, the window for implementing and announcing an official ban is narrowing.\n   - Significant policy changes of this magnitude typically involve preparation and staging, which may not be feasible in the remaining time.\n\n7. **Lack of Recent Definitive Indicators:**\n   - Recent subquestions reveal that while there are actions against YouTube, there have been no definitive moves or legislation passed in the immediate past indicating an imminent ban.\n   - High-ranking officials have not recently advocated explicitly for a ban.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the above factors, while there is a non-negligible risk of an official ban due to ongoing tensions and previous actions against other platforms, the combination of public opposition, practical considerations, and limited time frame reduces the likelihood.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 15%**", "probability": 15}
