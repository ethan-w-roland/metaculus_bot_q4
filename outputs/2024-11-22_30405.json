    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Ukraine use ATACMS to strike deep within Russia before 1 January 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2025, Ukraine uses ATACMS to strike any location within the pre-2014 borders of Russia, excluding those Russian oblasts that are immediately adjacent to Ukrainian-held territory: Bryansk, Kursk, and Belgorod.\n\nIf no such reports are available before 7 January 2025, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- Credible sources must confirm that the missile(s) landed in the specified area.\n- Intercepted missiles will not resolve this question positively.  \n- Missiles that strike in the specified area, but do not detonate (e.g., due to malfunction) will nonetheless result in a **Yes** resolution.\n- In the event of ambiguity regarding whether a missile strike was intercepted or successful, Metaculus admins may use their discretion based on information available from credible sources.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nOn November 17, 2024, Joe Biden [authorised](https://apnews.com/article/biden-ukraine-long-range-weapons-russia-52d424158182de2044ecc8bfcf011f9c) Ukraine to utilise the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) for strikes deep within Russian territory. This marks a significant shift in US policy, as previous restrictions limited Ukraine's use of US missiles to occupied territories and attacks just across the border.\n\nThe authorization came as a response to [the deployment](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2796pdm1lo) of North Korean troops supporting Russian forces in their fight against Ukraine. On [November 19](https://www.ft.com/content/3f4654ec-4dbd-45d1-9d51-869993c717d0), Ukraine hit a weapons arsenal in Bryansk, 190km from the current frontlines.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Ukraine using ATACMS to strike deep within Russia before 1 January 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Authorization\nAs of November 17, 2024, the White House, under President Joe Biden, has reportedly lifted restrictions on Ukraine's use of U.S.-provided ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) to strike targets deep within Russian territory[2][3][4].\n\n## Capabilities and Constraints\nThe ATACMS missiles have a range of up to 190 miles (306 km), which would allow Ukrainian forces to target Russian territories beyond the immediate front lines. However, there are significant constraints, including limited U.S. stockpiles and production capabilities for these missiles. This limitation could affect the frequency and scale of such strikes[3].\n\n## Current Conflict Dynamics\nThe conflict between Ukraine and Russia remains intense, with recent large-scale Russian air attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure and other targets. This escalation suggests that both sides are engaged in significant military actions, increasing the likelihood of retaliatory measures[2][4].\n\n## Political and Strategic Considerations\nThe decision to allow Ukraine to use ATACMS against Russian targets is seen as a significant escalation and has been described as crossing a Russian \"red line.\" This could lead to further retaliation from Russia, both within Ukraine and potentially in other regions[3].\n\n## Time Frame\nGiven the recent authorization and the ongoing nature of the conflict, there is a plausible window for Ukraine to utilize these missiles before January 1, 2025. The urgency and severity of the situation, as well as Ukraine's stated goals to end the war in 2025, suggest that such actions could be taken in the near future[2][3][4].\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile there are no guarantees, the recent authorization, the ongoing intensity of the conflict, and the strategic considerations all suggest that Ukraine has both the capability and the motivation to use ATACMS to strike deep within Russia before January 1, 2025. However, the final decision would depend on various factors including military strategy, diplomatic developments, and the response from Russia.\n\n### Superforecaster Relevant Details\n- **Base Rates**: The historical context of the conflict and previous escalations suggest that both sides are willing to use significant military force.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The window for action is relatively short, given the January 1, 2025, deadline.\n- **Current State of the World**: The conflict is ongoing with significant recent escalations.\n- **Reference Classes**: Similar conflicts and escalations in the past can provide insights into the likelihood of further military actions.\n- **Constraints and Capabilities**: The limited supply of ATACMS and other military resources could influence the frequency and impact of such strikes.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Ukraine received ATACMS from the United States as of November 22, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 22, 2024, Ukraine has received ATACMS missiles from the United States. President Joe Biden has given permission for Ukraine to begin firing U.S.-made ATACMS missiles, and Ukraine has already used these missiles to target a weapons facility in Russia's Bryansk region[1][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any reported deployments of ATACMS by Ukrainian forces since the authorization on November 17, 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe provided source does not mention the deployment of ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) by Ukrainian forces, nor does it discuss any authorization for such deployments on November 17, 2024. Therefore, based on the given information, it is unclear whether Ukrainian forces have deployed ATACMS since the specified date.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Russia issued any formal warnings or taken measures to prevent Ukrainian ATACMS strikes deep within its territory?\nANSWER: Based on the provided source, Russia has indeed taken steps and issued warnings in response to the potential use of Ukrainian ATACMS strikes deep within its territory.\n\n- Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned that the attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro was a response to Ukraine's use of US and UK-supplied long-range weaponry towards targets inside Russia.\n- Putin also suggested that Russia could attack military facilities of those countries which allowed their weapons to be used for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Ukraine have sufficient stockpiles of ATACMS to conduct multiple deep strikes into Russia?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that Ukraine does not have sufficient stockpiles of ATACMS to conduct multiple deep strikes into Russia. For instance, it is mentioned that the United States has finite supplies of ATACMS, and Ukraine possesses less than fifty of these missiles[3].\n\nAdditionally, the article highlights that the U.S. cannot provide Ukraine the volume of materiel it would need to shift the balance of power on the ground, including the ATACMS missiles, due to limitations in U.S. stockpiles and defense production[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there ongoing military operations by Ukraine that could facilitate the use of ATACMS deep within Russia?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence to suggest that Ukraine has been engaging in military operations that could potentially facilitate the use of ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) deep within Russia.\n\n- In August 2024, Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive into Russia's Kursk Oblast, which indicates that Ukraine is capable of and willing to conduct military operations within Russian territory[1].\n\nThis suggests that Ukraine has the intent and some capability to operate militarily inside Russia, which could include the use of long-range missiles like ATACMS if they were available.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Ukraine publicly stated an intention to use ATACMS against targets within the pre-2014 borders of Russia?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit statement from Ukraine indicating a public intention to use ATACMS against targets within the pre-2014 borders of Russia. The sources do mention that Ukraine has used ATACMS to hit targets in Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, but they do not specify any public intention to use these missiles against targets within the pre-2014 borders of Russia[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been recent escalations in the Ukraine-Russia conflict that would increase the likelihood of using ATACMS for deep strikes?\nANSWER: YES\n\nRecent developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict have indeed increased the likelihood of further escalation, which could include the use of ATACMS (Army Tactical Missile System) for deep strikes. Here are some key points from the source:\n\n- North Korean forces have deployed to support Russia’s war effort, which has increased the risk of further escalation[1].\n- Ukraine has been conducting long-range strikes on Russian cities and military bases, and there has been a recent authorization for the use of U.S. missiles in support of Ukraine’s operations[1].\n- The involvement of outside forces and the ongoing desperate attacks by both sides to improve their bargaining positions have heightened the conflict’s intensity[1].\n\nThese factors suggest an escalating environment where deeper strikes, potentially including the use of ATACMS, could become more likely.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant changes in the political or military support from the United States to Ukraine regarding the use of ATACMS?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThere have been significant changes in the political and military support from the United States to Ukraine regarding the use of ATACMS missiles. Previously, the Biden administration had restricted Ukrainian forces from using ATACMS missiles against Russian targets. However, the administration has now given permission for Ukraine to begin firing these missiles into Russia, marking a reversal of their previous policy[1]. This change is attributed to several factors, including Ukraine's persistent pleas and Russia's deployment of North Korean ground troops, as well as the uncertainty surrounding how the incoming Trump administration will handle the war[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are diplomatic efforts between Ukraine and Russia aimed at de-escalating the conflict, potentially reducing the likelihood of deep ATACMS strikes?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether current diplomatic efforts between Ukraine and Russia are specifically aimed at de-escalating the conflict to the extent of reducing the likelihood of deep ATACMS strikes.\n\n- The Stimson Center report suggests that there are proposals for a phased de-escalation and a negotiated armistice or ceasefire, but it does not indicate that these efforts are currently underway or successful[1].\n- The UN Security Council discussion highlights the ongoing conflict and the need for negotiations, but it does not provide evidence of active diplomatic efforts between Ukraine and Russia aimed at de-escalation[3].\n- The other sources discuss various aspects of the conflict, including military actions and international responses, but do not provide clear evidence of diplomatic efforts specifically focused on de-escalation[2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the production rate of ATACMS sufficient to meet Ukraine’s potential demand for deep strikes before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: The production rate of ATACMS, while improved, is still not sufficient to fully meet Ukraine’s potential demand for deep strikes before January 1, 2025, based on the available information.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- The production rate has increased to \"dozens of missiles\" per month, which is an improvement from the previous rate of just a few missiles per month[1][2][4].\n- Despite this increase, the overall supply of ATACMS remains limited. The U.S. has a constrained stockpile, and the production capacity, although ramping up, is not yet at a level to meet high demand quickly[1][2][4].\n- The U.S. is also transitioning to the production of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), which will eventually replace ATACMS, but this transition is still in progress and does not immediately address the current demand[1][2].\n\nGiven these factors, it is unclear if the current production rate can fully satisfy Ukraine’s potential demand for deep strikes by January 1, 2025, especially considering the strategic and logistical constraints mentioned.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n40 days (from November 22, 2024, to January 1, 2025)\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nNo\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \n5%\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \n30%\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**Current Situation and Authorization:**  \nUkraine has received authorization and initial ATACMS missiles from the United States as of November 17, 2024. The use of ATACMS for strikes deep within Russia represents a significant escalation in the conflict. While Ukraine has demonstrated the capability by striking a weapons facility in Bryansk, the overall stockpile of ATACMS is limited (fewer than 50 missiles), which restricts the frequency and scale of potential strikes.\n\n**Conflict Dynamics:**  \nThe ongoing intense conflict, including recent Russian air attacks and the deployment of North Korean troops in support of Russia, creates a backdrop where both sides are actively engaging in military operations. This environment increases the likelihood of retaliatory and proactive measures from Ukraine, potentially including deeper strikes using ATACMS.\n\n**Constraints and Limitations:**  \nDespite the authorization, the limited stockpile of ATACMS missiles poses a significant constraint. Producing enough missiles to sustain multiple deep strikes within the 40-day window is challenging. Additionally, the potential for Russian retaliation could deter Ukraine from initiating such strikes unless the strategic benefits are deemed substantial.\n\n**Political and Strategic Considerations:**  \nThe decision to use ATACMS for deep strikes is influenced by both military strategy and diplomatic considerations. Ukraine's primary goal to end the war by 2025 provides motivation, but the risks associated with escalation, including international diplomatic repercussions and increased support for Russia, may temper the likelihood of deploying ATACMS deep within Russia.\n\n**Base Rates and Calibration:**  \nHistorically, the use of advanced missile systems in active conflict zones is significant but not routine, especially when stockpiles are limited. Given the short time frame of 40 days, the probability of Ukraine deciding to use ATACMS for deep strikes is moderate but constrained by logistical and strategic factors.\n\n**Time Frame Analysis:**  \nWith approximately six weeks left until the resolution date, the window for decision-making is narrow. If the time frame were reduced to 10 days, the probability of such strikes would be minimal (around 5%) due to the time required for planning and deployment. Conversely, extending the time frame to 160 days increases the probability to about 30% as it allows for potential stockpile replenishment, strategic reevaluations, and evolving conflict dynamics.\n\n**Final Consideration:**  \nBalancing the authorization and capability against the constraints and strategic risks leads to a moderate probability assessment. While Ukraine possesses the means and some motivation to use ATACMS for deep strikes, the limited missile stockpile and potential for significant escalation temper the likelihood within the given time frame.\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
