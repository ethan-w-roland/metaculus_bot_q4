    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill China's youth unemployment rate be greater than 19.0 for November 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-13\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve based on the youth unemployment rate for November 2024, as reported by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/youth-unemployment-rate), using data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe youth unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force aged 16-24 without work but available for and seeking employment, based on the calculation method used by the National Bureau of Statistics of China as of August 2024.\n\nIf the National Bureau of Statistics of China revises its calculation method or age range for the youth unemployment rate before September 2024, the question will be resolved using the most up-to-date definition and methodology.\n\nIn the event that Trading Economics does not report the youth unemployment rate for August 2024 before October 7, 2024, or if the data is not available from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS), the question will resolve as \"Annulled\". The data can be found [directly from the NBS here](https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=A01) by selecting \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate\" under \"Indicators\" on the left side and observing the data in the row labeled \"The Urban Surveyed Unemployment Rate of the Population Aged from 16 to 24 Excluding Students(%)\".\n\nBACKGROUND:\nChina's youth unemployment rate, which measures the percentage of people aged 16 to 24 who are not in school and are unemployed, has been a growing concern for the country's policymakers and economists. In July 2024, the rate [soared to 17.1%](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/chinas-youth-unemployment-soars-above-17percent-in-july.html), the highest level since the new system of record-keeping began in December 2023.\n\nThe new calculation method, introduced in late 2023, excludes those who are still in school, as more people in China are pursuing higher education amid a more competitive job market. Under the previous calculation method, the youth unemployment rate had reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023.\n\nThe rising youth unemployment rate has been attributed to various factors, including the ongoing economic challenges, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and structural changes in the labor market. As the issue continues to draw attention, this question aims to predict the youth unemployment rate for August 2024, providing insight into the short-term trajectory of this critical economic indicator.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of China's youth unemployment rate exceeding 19.0% in November 2024, here are some key points and trends that can inform this prediction:\n\n## Current Trends\n- The youth unemployment rate in China has been on an upward trend. In August 2024, it surged to 18.8%, up from 17.1% in July and 13.2% in June[3][4][5].\n- This increase is partly due to the large number of college graduates entering the job market, with nearly 12 million students graduating in June 2024, which heightens competition in an already challenging job market[2][5].\n\n## Economic Context\n- China's economy is facing significant challenges, including a slowdown in key sectors such as real estate, finance, and IT. This has led to reduced hiring by companies due to concerns over costs and legal issues associated with laying off employees[3][4].\n- The overall urban unemployment rate has remained relatively stable around 5%, but the youth unemployment rate is more sensitive to changes in the job market and has been rising[3][4].\n\n## Government Actions\n- The Chinese government has introduced various initiatives to support employment, such as subsidies for companies hiring college graduates, creating internship positions, and recognizing new professions in the digital economy and smart manufacturing. However, the impact of these measures may take time to materialize[2][4].\n\n## Structural Issues\n- There is a mismatch between the skills of graduates and the requirements of the job market. Many graduates lack the professional skills needed in various industries, leading to structural unemployment[2][4].\n- Young people are also shunning blue-collar jobs, which are often in high demand but seen as less desirable, contributing to the unemployment issue[1].\n\n## Base Rates and Recent Data\n- The recent data shows a consistent increase in youth unemployment rates, with August 2024 seeing the highest rate since the new record-keeping system began. Given this trend, it is plausible that the rate could continue to rise or at least remain high[3][4][5].\n\nGiven these points, while it is impossible to predict with certainty, the current trends and economic context suggest that the youth unemployment rate could potentially remain high or even exceed 19.0% in November 2024. However, this is speculative based on current data and trends, and actual figures could vary based on unforeseen economic changes or the effectiveness of government interventions.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Chinese government changed the calculation method for the youth unemployment rate after August 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the Chinese government has changed the calculation method for the youth unemployment rate after August 2024. The sources mention that the government had previously changed the methodology in December 2023 to exclude university students from the calculations, but there is no mention of any further changes after August 2024[2][3][5].\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been an increase in the number of college graduates entering the Chinese job market in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe sources indicate that there has been a significant increase in the number of college graduates entering the Chinese job market in 2024. For example, it is mentioned that China's record class of 2024 college graduates consists of 11.8 million students, which is a large number entering the job market at the same time[2][3]. Additionally, the National Bureau of Statistics noted that nearly 12 million students graduated from Chinese universities in June 2024, contributing to the heightened competition in the job market[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are structural issues in China's labor market, such as skill mismatches among young workers, persisting into 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe sources provided clearly indicate that structural issues in China's labor market, including skill mismatches among young workers, are persisting into 2024.\n\n- The article from China Briefing mentions that \"skills mismatches persist, hindering effective employment\" and highlights the challenge of nearly 12 million new graduates in 2024 exacerbating job scarcity due to these mismatches[1].\n- The Harvard International Review article notes that the higher quantity and lower quality of Chinaâ€™s higher education institutions contribute to high unemployment rates because many graduates lack the skills desired by employers[5].\n- Bloomberg's article also touches on the broader structural issues, including the need to resolve these to boost employment, which implies ongoing challenges such as skill mismatches[2].\n\nThese sources collectively confirm that skill mismatches and other structural issues continue to affect the labor market in China in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China's youth unemployment rate been increasing consistently since 2022?\nANSWER: No, China's youth unemployment rate has not been increasing consistently since 2022. Here are the key points:\n\n- The youth unemployment rate in China did increase steadily until it reached a record high of 21.3% in June 2023, but this was before the data publication was temporarily suspended[3][5].\n- The data publication was halted from June 2023 to January 2024, during which time the methodology for calculating the youth unemployment rate was revised to exclude university students[2][4][5].\n- When the data publication resumed in January 2024, the youth unemployment rate was reported at 14.9% for December 2023, and it then fluctuated, increasing to 18.8% in August 2024 before dropping to 17.6% in September 2024[2][4][5].\n\nThus, while there have been periods of increase, the rate has not been consistently increasing since 2022 due to the temporary halt in data publication and the subsequent revisions in methodology.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the COVID-19 pandemic continue to affect China's economy significantly in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to have a significant impact on China's economy in 2024, although the direct measures of the \"zero-COVID\" policy were ended in late 2022.\n\n- The economic slowdown and structural challenges persist, with China's GDP growth projected to be 4.8 percent in 2024, which is below the annual growth target of 5 percent[1][5].\n- The aftermath of the \"zero-COVID\" policy, including the economic damage from lockdowns, disrupted supply chains, and weakened consumer spending, continues to affect the economy[3][4].\n- Issues such as deflation, a struggling real estate sector, high youth unemployment, and declining domestic and external demand are ongoing, reflecting the long-term impact of the pandemic and associated policies[2][3][5].\n\nThese factors indicate that the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are still being felt in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has China's economy experienced a significant downturn leading up to November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nSeveral sources indicate that China's economy has experienced a significant downturn leading up to November 2024.\n\n- China's recent economic data has shown a grim outlook, with slower-than-expected growth in retail sales, industrial output, and urban investments. The urban unemployment rate has also risen, and home prices have declined at their fastest rate in nearly a decade[1].\n- Foreign direct investment in China has slumped, with a significant drop in the third quarter, and there is a risk of the first annual net outflow in foreign direct investment since at least 1990[2].\n- The real estate market is in a protracted downturn, consumers have held back spending, local government finances are deteriorating, and the private sector's 'animal spirits' remain weak. These factors have contributed to a slow and painful economic adjustment[3].\n- There are also indications that China's economy risks heading into recession, with producer prices entering deflation and GDP growth falling behind the government's target of about 5%[4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have government interventions failed to make a significant impact on reducing youth unemployment by November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the impact of government interventions on reducing youth unemployment by November 2024 is mixed and varies by region and country.\n\n### Global Perspective\n- The ILO report indicates that globally, the youth unemployment rate has improved, reaching a 15-year low of 13% in 2023, and is expected to fall further to 12.8% in 2024 and 2025. This suggests some positive impact from global efforts[1].\n\n### South Africa\n- Despite some positive trends in overall employment, the youth unemployment rate in South Africa remains high. The expanded youth unemployment rate is at 55.2%, which has not significantly improved from pre-COVID levels. This indicates that government interventions in South Africa have not yet made a significant impact on reducing youth unemployment[2][5].\n\n### United States\n- In the U.S., the youth unemployment rate was 9.8% in July 2024, which is higher than the rate in July 2023. While there are seasonal fluctuations, this does not indicate a significant reduction in youth unemployment through government interventions by November 2024[4].\n\nGiven these varied outcomes, it is clear that while there are some positive global trends, government interventions have not uniformly succeeded in significantly reducing youth unemployment across all regions, particularly in countries like South Africa.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the slowdown in key sectors like real estate and finance continued into late 2024?\nANSWER: The slowdown in key sectors like real estate and finance has indeed continued into late 2024, as indicated by several sources:\n\n## Real Estate Sector\n- Despite mortgage rates trending downward, the housing market remains challenging due to high mortgage rates, steep home prices, and low inventory levels. Existing-home sales in September 2024 were down by 3.5 percent from the previous year, and the Pending Home Sales Index fell sharply in July[2][4].\n- Inventory continues to be tight, with levels still 33% lower than pre-pandemic averages, although current inventory levels are at their smallest deficit since fall 2020[1][2].\n\n## Finance Sector\n- Mortgage rates, although lower than their peak, remain relatively high, affecting affordability and homebuying demand. The average 30-year mortgage rate was around 6.88% in late October 2024, which is still much higher than most homeownersâ€™ locked-in rates[2][4].\n- The refinance market is not expected to see a significant surge, with rates needing to drop below 6.5% to make refinancing attractive for a significant number of borrowers[3].\n\nOverall, these factors indicate that the slowdown in the real estate and finance sectors has persisted into late 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did global economic conditions worsen in 2024, negatively impacting China's employment rates?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, here are the key points relevant to the question:\n\n## Global Economic Conditions\n- Global economic growth is projected to be stable but at a lower level than in previous years. The IMF forecasts a 3.2% growth in 2024 and 2025, while the World Bank projects a 2.6% growth in 2024 and 2.7% in 2025-26[1][3][5].\n- Despite stabilization, the global economy faces several challenges, including geopolitical instability, high debt levels, and ongoing inflation, although at a moderating pace[1][3][4].\n\n## China's Economic Conditions\n- The World Economic Forum's report mentions that the outlook for China continues to be weak, making it an outlier among Asian economies. It does not specifically mention employment rates but indicates that China's economic performance is not as strong as other regions in Asia[4].\n\n## Employment Rates\n- None of the sources provided directly address the impact on China's employment rates in 2024. While there are mentions of growing concerns over unemployment in various regions and the global economy, there is no specific data or analysis on China's employment rates[1][2][4].\n\nGiven the information available, it is unclear whether global economic conditions worsened in 2024 and specifically negatively impacted China's employment rates.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the Chinese government implement effective policies to reduce youth unemployment before November 2024?\nANSWER: The information available suggests that the Chinese government has implemented several policies aimed at reducing youth unemployment, but it is unclear whether these policies have been effective as of November 2024.\n\nHere are some of the policies mentioned:\n\n- A policy introduced in July 2023 to encourage employers to hire fresh college graduates and registered unemployed youth by offering a one-time allowance of 1,500 yuan ($207) for each young person hired[2].\n- A 100-day campaign launched in June 2023 to find jobs for college graduates and job seekers, along with other employment campaigns and customized job services[2].\n- A 24-point plan issued by the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to promote high-quality and full employment, which includes measures such as pushing universities to align their programs with job market needs, requiring companies to invest in staff training, and prioritizing projects with strong job creation potential[3].\n- Policies to help students gain more professional training, integrate careers education into university programs, and provide vocational training in high schools[3].\n\nWhile these policies indicate a significant effort by the Chinese government to address youth unemployment, there is no clear evidence as of November 2024 that these measures have been successful in reducing youth unemployment rates substantially. The youth unemployment rate has continued to be a concern, with rates remaining high despite these efforts[4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as to whether these policies have been effective in reducing youth unemployment by November 2024.",
    "comment": "(a) Approximately 1 month left until the outcome is known, as the November 2024 youth unemployment rate is expected to be released in mid-December 2024.\n\n(b) If nothing changed, the youth unemployment rate for November 2024 would likely be below 19.0%.\n\n(c) If there was only a quarter of the time left (about one week), I would forecast a low probability that the rate exceeds 19.0%, given recent trends.\n\n(d) If there was four times the time left (about four months), I would forecast a higher probability that the rate exceeds 19.0%, due to increased uncertainty over a longer period.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 13, 2024, the most recent data available indicates that China's youth unemployment rate was **17.6% in September 2024**, down from **18.8% in August 2024**. This decrease suggests a potential stabilization or slight improvement in youth employment following a period of rising unemployment rates earlier in the year.\n\n**Current Trends:**\n\n- The youth unemployment rate peaked at 18.8% in August 2024 but has since decreased.\n- The large influx of nearly 12 million college graduates in mid-2024 initially strained the job market, contributing to higher unemployment rates.\n- Government initiatives aimed at reducing youth unemployment may be beginning to have a positive effect.\n\n**Economic Context:**\n\n- While China's economy has faced challenges in 2024, including a slowdown in key sectors like real estate and finance, recent data does not indicate a significant downturn severe enough to drastically increase unemployment rates in the immediate future.\n- The overall urban unemployment rate remains stable around 5%, suggesting some resilience in the broader labor market.\n\n**Government Actions:**\n\n- The Chinese government has implemented policies such as subsidies for companies hiring young workers and efforts to address skill mismatches.\n- While it's unclear how effective these policies have been to date, the recent decrease in youth unemployment may indicate some positive impact.\n\n**Considerations:**\n\n- With only one month until the data is released, there is limited time for significant changes to occur that would drive the unemployment rate above 19.0%.\n- Seasonal employment trends may also play a role, but November is not typically a period of drastic labor market shifts.\n- Potential risks include unforeseen economic shocks or policy changes that could negatively impact employment.\n\n**Time Frame Adjustments:**\n\n- **With less time left (one week):** The probability of significant change is lower, reinforcing the expectation that the rate will remain below 19.0%.\n- **With more time left (four months):** Increased uncertainty over a longer period could lead to economic developments that might push the unemployment rate above 19.0%.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the recent decrease in the youth unemployment rate and the limited time left until the November 2024 data is released, it is more likely that the rate will remain below 19.0%. However, acknowledging the inherent uncertainties and potential for unexpected events, there remains a moderate chance that the rate could exceed the threshold.\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
