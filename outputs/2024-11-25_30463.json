    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the year-over-year increase in rent in Los Angeles, CA in November 2024 be greater than or equal to 2.0%, according to Zillow?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Zillow reports in its [Housing Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) resource page that its Observed Rent Index for Los Angeles, CA has risen by ≥2.0% for November 2024. If this does not occur, then this resolves as **No**. The figure can be accessed either through observing the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) chart or through the CSV file. To download the CSV, under RENTALS, make sure Data Type is set to \"ZORI (Smoothed): All Homes Plus Multifamily Time Series\" and Geography is set to \"Metro & U.S.\" The RegionName \"Los Angeles, CA\" in the CSV will be used, specifically by looking at the year-over-year increase from November 2023 to November 2024. (First divide current value by prior value, then subtract one, then multiply by 100%.)\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that the instructions on how to access the CSV are provided for convenience only; according to Zillow, \"We make frequent changes to the download paths for CSVs.\" In the event the location of the data has changed, the question resolves based on the new location. The question will resolve as soon as the data is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date and the data has been reported. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. In the event the chart and CSV report different figures, the CSV will take precedence.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Zillow, housing data is updated on the 12th of each month.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if the year-over-year increase in rent in Los Angeles, CA in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 2.0% according to Zillow, here are the relevant points:\n\n## Current Rent Prices\nAs of October 2024, the median rent price in Los Angeles, CA is $2,800. This is $106 less than the median rent price in October 2023, which was $2,906[2].\n\n## Year-Over-Year Change\nThe year-over-year change from October 2023 to October 2024 shows a decrease of $106, or approximately a 3.6% decrease. Given that the rent has been relatively stable or slightly decreasing in recent months, it is unlikely that the year-over-year increase would suddenly exceed 2.0% by November 2024[2].\n\n## Monthly Trends\nThe monthly rent changes have been minimal, with a $34 decrease from September to October 2024. This trend suggests that significant year-over-year increases are not expected in the near term[2].\n\nBased on this information, it is highly unlikely that the year-over-year increase in rent in Los Angeles, CA in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 2.0%. The current data indicates a decrease rather than an increase in rent prices over the past year.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the median rent price in Los Angeles, CA increased from October 2023 to October 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the median rent price in Los Angeles, CA has actually decreased from October 2023 to October 2024.\n\nFrom Zillow, the median rent in October 2023 was $2,995, while in October 2024 it was $2,850, indicating a decrease of $145[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there any discrepancy reported between the ZORI chart and the ZORI CSV data for Los Angeles, CA in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information regarding discrepancies between the ZORI chart and the ZORI CSV data for Los Angeles, CA in November 2024. The Zillow Research page explains the methodology and update schedule for ZORI data but does not mention any discrepancies for specific regions or dates[1].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Zillow currently tracking the Observed Rent Index (ZORI) for Los Angeles, CA?\nANSWER: Yes, Zillow is currently tracking the Observed Rent Index (ZORI) for various regions, including metropolitan areas. Since Los Angeles, CA is a major metropolitan area, ZORI is calculated at this level.\n\n- ZORI is calculated at the national, metropolitan, county, city, and zip levels for all regions where sufficient data is available[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have monthly rent prices in Los Angeles, CA decreased consistently over the past year?\nANSWER: No, monthly rent prices in Los Angeles, CA have not decreased consistently over the past year. According to the sources:\n\n- There was a 2.6% decrease in rent prices over the past year, but this trend was not consistent throughout the year. Specifically, the first half of 2024 saw a 1.6% increase in rent prices[1].\n- This indicates that while there was an overall decrease, there was also a period of increase, making the trend not consistently downward[1][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the demand for rental properties in Los Angeles, CA increased in the last six months?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the demand for rental properties in Los Angeles, CA, has remained strong but with some nuances in the last six months.\n\n- The sources indicate that the rental market in Los Angeles continues to be tight, with high occupancy rates and stable to slightly increasing rental prices. For example, the vacancy rate has risen slightly but remains low, around 4-5.1%[1][2][5].\n- Despite economic uncertainties and rising interest rates, the demand for rental housing has been sustained by a growing population, high home prices, and a diverse economy[2][5].\n- There has been no significant decline in demand; instead, the market has seen stabilization after a period of rapid growth, with rental prices remaining high but not increasing as rapidly as before[2][5].\n\nTherefore, while the demand has not necessarily increased dramatically in the last six months, it has certainly remained strong and stable.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current unemployment rate in Los Angeles, CA lower than it was in November 2023?\nANSWER: To determine if the current unemployment rate in Los Angeles, CA is lower than it was in November 2023, we need to compare the current rate with the rate from November 2023.\n\n### Current Unemployment Rate\nAs of September 2024, the unemployment rate in Los Angeles County was 6.0%[2][3][4].\n\n### Unemployment Rate in November 2023\nIn November 2023, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Los Angeles County was 5.3%[4].\n\n### Comparison\nSince the current unemployment rate (6.0% as of September 2024) is higher than the rate in November 2023 (5.3%), the current unemployment rate is not lower than it was in November 2023.\n\n## NO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the median rent price in Los Angeles, CA decrease by at least 3.6% from October 2023 to October 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if the median rent price in Los Angeles, CA decreased by at least 3.6% from October 2023 to October 2024, we can refer to the data provided by Zillow.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the median rent in October 2023 was $2,995, and in October 2024, it was $2,800. This represents a decrease of $195 ($2,995 - $2,800)[3].\n\nTo calculate the percentage decrease:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage decrease} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Decrease in rent}}{\\text{Original rent}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage decrease} = \\left( \\frac{195}{2995} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 6.51\\%\n\\]\n\nSince the decrease is approximately 6.51%, which is greater than 3.6%, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Zillow report a year-over-year increase in the Observed Rent Index for any major cities in November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Zillow reported a year-over-year increase in the Observed Rent Index for several major cities in November 2024. According to the reports, rents were up from a year ago in many of the 50 largest metro areas. For example, cities like Providence, Hartford, Cincinnati, and Louisville saw significant annual increases in rent[1][2][3].\n\nSpecifically, the reports mention that:\n- Providence saw a 7.7% annual increase[1].\n- Hartford saw a 7% annual increase[1].\n- Cincinnati saw a 6.8% annual increase[1].\n- Louisville saw a 6.6% annual increase[1].\n\nThese figures indicate that there were indeed year-over-year increases in the Observed Rent Index for these and other major cities.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major new housing developments or shortages in Los Angeles, CA in the past year?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been both major new housing developments and significant shortages in Los Angeles, CA in the past year.\n\n### Major New Housing Developments:\n- The Fourth and Central Project, a mixed-use residential project in downtown Los Angeles, has been streamlined by Governor Gavin Newsom. This project is expected to deliver more than 1,500 new homes, office space, and retail, and is anticipated to create up to 10,000 union jobs[1].\n- LA Metro has completed the La Veranda project in Boyle Heights, a mixed-use affordable housing development that includes 76 income-restricted affordable apartments and ground-floor retail space. This is part of Metro’s goal to expand its housing portfolio to 10,000 units by 2031[4].\n\n### Housing Shortages:\n- Residential permitting in Los Angeles has seen a significant decline. In the first half of 2024, there was an 18.9% drop in residential permits compared to the same period in 2023, and by the first three quarters of 2024, this decline had increased to 30.7%[2][3].\n- The reports highlight that despite some localized increases in housing construction, the overall trend shows a shortage of deed-restricted affordable housing, compounded by factors such as high interest rates and local housing policies like Measure ULA[2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any significant economic event in Los Angeles, CA between October 2023 and November 2024 that could affect rent prices?\nANSWER: Between October 2023 and November 2024, there have been several economic events and trends in Los Angeles, CA, that could potentially affect rent prices:\n\n## Employment Trends\n- Los Angeles County experienced an increase in nonfarm employment, with 45,900 new jobs added between October 2023 and October 2024, which is a 1.0% increase. This growth could influence housing demand and, by extension, rent prices[1].\n\n## Industry-Specific Job Changes\n- Certain sectors saw significant job gains, such as trade, transportation, and utilities (up 6,700 jobs), private education and health services, financial activities, and professional and business services. Conversely, sectors like information, construction, leisure and hospitality, manufacturing, and government saw job declines. These shifts in employment could impact the local economy and housing market[1].\n\n## Economic Events and Conferences\n- While events like the 2024 California Economic Summit, the Los Angeles Business Journal's various events (e.g., Top 100 Accountants, SoCal ORBIE Awards, and others), and the Future of Work Conference do not directly report on rent prices, they indicate ongoing economic activity and discussions about economic growth, workforce development, and industry trends. These activities can influence the broader economic climate, which in turn could affect rent prices[2][3][4].\n\n## Economic Outlook\n- The UCLA Anderson Forecast, which provides economic outlooks, would be another indicator of economic trends that could influence rent prices. However, the specific forecasts between October 2023 and November 2024 are not detailed in the provided sources, but such forecasts typically cover employment, housing, and other economic indicators that could impact rent prices[5].\n\nGiven these points, there have been significant economic activities and employment trends in Los Angeles between October 2023 and November 2024 that could potentially affect rent prices.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:** Less than 1 week. Given that today's date is November 25, 2024, and Zillow updates its housing data on the 12th of each month, the November 2024 data has likely already been released. The outcome should be accessible imminently, pending official reporting by Metaculus Admins.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If current trends and conditions remain consistent, the year-over-year increase in rent in Los Angeles, CA for November 2024, according to Zillow, would **not** be greater than or equal to 2.0%. The existing data shows a decrease in median rent prices over the past year, coupled with minimal monthly changes, suggesting continued stabilization or slight reductions in rent.\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With only a quarter of the time remaining, the forecast remains **unchanged**. Limited additional time does not present new factors that would significantly alter the current trend of decreasing or stable rent prices in Los Angeles.\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:** Extending the timeframe fourfold would still support a forecast of **No**. The underlying economic indicators, such as higher unemployment rates and consistent decreases in median rent prices, are likely to persist, maintaining the probability that rent increases do not reach or exceed the 2.0% threshold.\n\n**Rationale:** The available data indicates a clear trend of decreasing median rent prices year-over-year in Los Angeles, CA, with a 3.6% decrease from October 2023 to October 2024. Monthly rent changes have been minimal or negative, and economic factors like increased unemployment rates further suggest downward or stable rent pressures. While some major cities have experienced rent increases, Los Angeles' local market conditions do not align with this trend. Additionally, housing developments have not sufficed to counteract the existing shortages and economic challenges. Therefore, the likelihood that Zillow reports a year-over-year rent increase of ≥2.0% for November 2024 in Los Angeles is exceptionally low.\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
