    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the year-over-year increase in prices of homes in Hartford, CT in November 2024 be greater than or equal to 7.0%, according to Zillow?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Zillow reports in its [Housing Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) resource page that its Zillow Home Value Index, Raw for Hartford, CT, has risen by ≥7.0% for November 2024. If this does not occur, then this resolves as **No**. The figure can be accessed either through observing the Zillow Zillow Home Value Index, Raw (ZHVI) chart or through the CSV file. To download the CSV, under HOME VALUES, make sure Data Type is set to \"ZHVI All Homes (SFR, Condo/Co-op) Time Series, Raw, Mid-Tier ($)\" and Geography is set to \"Metro & U.S.\" The RegionName \"Hartford, CT\" in the CSV will be used, specifically by looking at the year-over-year increase from November 2023 to November 2024. (First divide current value by prior value, then subtract one, then multiply by 100%.)\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that the instructions on how to access the CSV are provided for convenience only; according to Zillow, \"We make frequent changes to the download paths for CSVs.\" In the event the location of the data has changed, the question resolves based on the new location. The question will resolve as soon as the data is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date and the data has been reported. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. In the event the chart and CSV report different figures, the CSV will take precedence.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Zillow, housing data is updated on the 12th of each month.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information provided from Zillow and related sources, it is highly unlikely that the year-over-year increase in home prices in Hartford, CT in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 7.0%.\n\nHere are the key points:\n- Zillow's latest forecasts indicate a much more modest growth in home values. As of October 2024, Zillow anticipates home values to climb by 2% in 2024 and 1% in the 12 months ending June 2025, which is significantly lower than a 7% increase[3].\n- Previous forecasts were also revised downward, with Zillow predicting a 0.1% decrease in home prices between October 2023 and October 2024 at one point[4].\n- For Hartford, CT specifically, there is mention of a very low increase forecast, with one source indicating that Hartford, CT home values are expected to increase by only 0.1% based on certain data[2].\n\nGiven these forecasts, a year-over-year increase of 7.0% or greater is not supported by the current data and projections from Zillow.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Zillow published the Zillow Home Value Index for Hartford, CT for November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) for Hartford, CT being published for November 2024. The most recent data mentioned in the sources is up to June 30, 2024, for Hartford[2].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Zillow's October 2024 forecast predict a year-over-year home price increase of at least 7.0% for Hartford, CT?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nZillow's October 2024 forecast did not predict a year-over-year home price increase of at least 7.0% for Hartford, CT. According to the forecasts, Hartford, CT is expected to see a home price increase of +2.4% over the next 12 months[4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the median home price in Hartford, CT increased by at least 7.0% year-over-year as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the median home price in Hartford, CT has indeed increased significantly year-over-year as of October 2024, which is the most recent data available.\n\n- According to the Rocket Homes report, the median home sold price in Hartford was $289,900 in October 2024, up 16% from the previous year[1].\n- The Redfin report also indicates that Hartford home prices were up 17.4% compared to last year, with a median price of $300K in October 2024[3].\n\nSince both sources show an increase of more than 16%, it is clear that the median home price in Hartford, CT has increased by at least 7.0% year-over-year.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of increased investor activity in the Hartford, CT housing market in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there is evidence of increased investor activity in the Hartford, CT housing market in 2024.\n\n- Hartford is described as a market with stability and potential for real estate investors, driven by its growing population, thriving job market, and diverse economy. This makes it an attractive location for both long-term and short-term rental properties[2].\n- The city's revitalization and growing demand for housing, coupled with its relatively accessible home prices and increasing home values, are factors that draw investors[1][5].\n- Despite challenges such as high interest rates and tighter lending standards, multifamily housing in Hartford remains a popular investment vehicle, with ongoing development projects and a strong demand for multifamily properties[3].\n\nThese points indicate that Hartford is seeing increased interest and activity from real estate investors in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the housing supply in Hartford, CT decreased by more than 10% since November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the information about the housing supply in Hartford, CT from November 2023 to October 2024 is not directly available. However, here are some key points that can help infer the trend:\n\n- The number of homes for sale in Hartford, CT in October 2024 was 213, which is a 1.9% increase compared to September 2024[1].\n- The inventory changes by bedroom type in Hartford, CT from September to October 2024 show a mix of increases and decreases, but no overall decrease of more than 10% in the total inventory[1].\n\nSince the sources do not provide a direct comparison from November 2023 to October 2024, and only offer month-to-month or year-over-year comparisons that do not align with the specific time frame of November 2023 to October 2024, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Zillow revised their home price forecasts for Hartford, CT upward since October 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if Zillow has revised their home price forecasts for Hartford, CT upward since October 2024, we need to compare the forecasts provided in the sources.\n\nAs of the latest forecasts:\n- In the source from November 2024, Zillow expects Hartford, CT to see a 2.4% increase in home prices over the next 12 months from July 2024 to July 2025[5].\n\nEarlier forecasts:\n- There is no specific mention of Hartford, CT in the earlier forecasts provided in the sources before October 2024. However, the general national forecasts were revised multiple times, but these do not specifically address Hartford, CT[3][4].\n\nGiven the information, the only specific forecast for Hartford, CT is the 2.4% increase mentioned in the November 2024 source. There is no earlier specific forecast for Hartford, CT to compare it to, so we cannot definitively say if this is an upward revision.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did any major employers in Hartford, CT announce expansions or new jobs between November 2023 and November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there were announcements of expansions and new jobs by major employers in Hartford, CT, and the surrounding areas between November 2023 and November 2024.\n\n- Connecticut Children’s is undergoing a $326 million campus expansion in Hartford, which is part of a broader effort to stimulate economic and social growth in the area[2].\n- Four life sciences companies, including MannKind Corporation, Millstone Medical, ReST Therapeutics, and Revalia Bio, announced expansions in Connecticut. While not all are specifically in Hartford, these expansions indicate significant economic activity in the state, including in nearby areas. For example, MannKind Corporation added jobs in Danbury, and ReST Therapeutics is setting up its U.S. headquarters in New Haven[3].\n- Additionally, various other businesses and employers in Connecticut have announced new locations, expansions, and hiring initiatives during this period, such as the opening of new stores, restaurants, and facilities across different parts of the state[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have mortgage interest rates fallen by more than 1% in Hartford, CT since November 2023?\nANSWER: To determine if mortgage interest rates have fallen by more than 1% in Hartford, CT since November 2023, we need to compare the current rates with those from November 2023.\n\n### Current Rates (November 2024)\n- For commercial mortgages in Hartford, the rates are as follows: Multifamily loans at 5.51%, Commercial Real Estate Loans at 6.92%, etc.[1].\n- However, these rates are for commercial mortgages and not directly comparable to residential mortgage rates.\n\n### Residential Mortgage Rates\n- As of November 2024, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in Connecticut is around 6.88%[3].\n- In November 2023, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was around 7.44%[2].\n\n### Comparison\n- The difference between the November 2023 rate (7.44%) and the November 2024 rate (6.88%) is approximately 0.56%, which is less than 1%.\n\nTherefore, based on the residential mortgage rates, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the demand for homes in Hartford, CT increased significantly since November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several indicators that suggest an increase in demand for homes in Hartford, CT since November 2023:\n\n1. **Price Increases**: Homes in Hartford have sold for significantly more than they did a year ago. For example, the median home sold price in October 2024 was $289,900, up 16% from the previous year[2], and another source indicates a 17.4% increase in home prices compared to last year[3].\n\n2. **Sales Above Asking Price**: A significant percentage of homes are selling above the asking price. In October 2024, 70.3% of homes sold above asking price[2], which is a strong indicator of high demand.\n\n3. **Days on Market**: Homes are selling quickly, with an average of 41 days on the market, although this is slightly longer than the previous year's 26 days[3]. However, the competitive nature of the market is still evident.\n\n4. **Inventory and Sales**: While the number of homes for sale has seen a slight increase, the demand is still outpacing the supply. For instance, the number of homes sold in October 2024 was down by 11.9% month-over-month, but this does not necessarily indicate a decrease in demand, as prices and sales above asking price suggest continued strong interest[2].\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that the demand for homes in Hartford, CT has remained strong and possibly increased since November 2023.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant economic developments in Hartford, CT between November 2023 and November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several significant economic developments in Hartford, CT between November 2023 and November 2024:\n\n## Real Estate and Development\n- Shelbourne, a major developer, has continued to expand its holdings in downtown Hartford, acquiring interests in properties such as the Millennium hotel, the former Fuller Brush factory (being converted into apartments), and additional retail, residential, and office properties on Main, Trumbull, and Pratt Streets. This includes a significant focus on Pratt Street, a pedestrian-only district, where the company owns nearly a dozen addresses[1].\n\n## Funding and Grants\n- The city and state have directed millions of dollars in federal American Rescue Plan Act funding to support interior and exterior renovations for commercial landlords and small businesses, with many grant recipients located on or near Pratt Street[1].\n\n## Economic Growth and Job Market\n- Despite a slower economic growth in the first quarter of 2024, with Connecticut's real GDP growing 0.7% and ranking 35th nationally, the state's personal income increased by 6.1% during the same period. The finance and insurance industry led growth in Connecticut, while manufacturing experienced a contraction[5].\n\n## Infrastructure and Redevelopment\n- Hartford officials are working on various infrastructure projects, including the installation of a pipe to transform underused buildings and parking lots into a vibrant mixed-use neighborhood south of Bushnell Park. Additionally, there are plans for the demolition of a building behind Dunkin’ Park to prepare the site for redevelopment[2].\n\n## Business Trends\n- Companies are continuing to migrate from the suburbs to downtown Hartford, despite elevated office vacancy rates. New businesses and amenities, such as a coffee shop and deli at the Colt Gateway complex and the addition of pickleball courts at 280 Trumbull St., are also contributing to the area's development[2].\n\nThese developments indicate active economic activity and investment in Hartford during the specified period.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 2 weeks.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If current trends and forecasts remain unchanged, the year-over-year increase in home prices in Hartford, CT, as reported by Zillow, would likely be **less than 7.0%**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With only about 3-4 days left, there is minimal opportunity for significant changes. The probability remains largely consistent with the current assessment, maintaining a **low likelihood** of a ≥7.0% increase.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** Extending the time frame to approximately 8 weeks would introduce more uncertainty due to potential economic shifts and market dynamics. However, given the strong existing forecasts indicating modest growth, the probability of a ≥7.0% increase remains **unlikely**, though slightly more uncertainty is present.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe primary determinant for this probability is Zillow's forecast, which anticipates modest growth in home values (around 2%) for Hartford, CT. While independent sources like Rocket Homes and Redfin report significant year-over-year increases exceeding 7%, these figures are not based on Zillow's ZHVI, which is the resolution criteria for this question. The conflicting data introduces some uncertainty, but the weight of Zillow's projections suggests that a ≥7.0% increase is unlikely. Additionally, the resolution relies specifically on Zillow's reporting, which currently does not indicate such a substantial increase. Therefore, despite some positive indicators from other sources, Zillow's stance leads to a lower probability estimate.\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
