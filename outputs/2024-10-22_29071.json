{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the USDA-posted recall of Pork Dynasty Inc.'s Ready-to-Eat Fried Pork Skin Products issued September 27, 2024 be closed before December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of Pork Dynasty Inc.'s Ready-to-Eat Fried Pork Skin Products is changed from Active to Closed when [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/pork-dynasty-inc--recalls-ready-eat-fried-pork-skin-products-due-misbranding-and) is accessed by Metaculus after December 31, 2024. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the USDA: \"JPork Dynasty Inc., a Houston, Texas establishment, is recalling approximately 469 pounds of ready-to-eat fried pork skin products due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. The product contains soy, a known allergen, which is not declared on the product label.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the USDA-posted recall of Pork Dynasty Inc.'s Ready-to-Eat Fried Pork Skin Products will be closed before December 31, 2024, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Recall Details\n- The recall was announced on September 27, 2024, due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen (soy) in the products.\n- The recall involves approximately 469 pounds of ready-to-eat fried pork skin products distributed to retail and restaurant locations in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\n## Recall Process\n- The recall was initiated after FSIS personnel discovered the issue during routine in-plant verification activities.\n- The FSIS conducts recall effectiveness checks to ensure that the recalling firm notifies its customers and takes steps to make certain the product is no longer available to consumers.\n\n## Current Status\n- As of the latest reports, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to the consumption of these products.\n- Consumers are advised not to consume the recalled products and to either dispose of them or return them to the place of purchase.\n\n## Closure of Recall\n- The closure of a recall typically depends on the effectiveness of the recall efforts, which include ensuring all affected products are removed from the market and that consumers are adequately informed.\n- The FSIS will continue to monitor the situation and conduct recall effectiveness checks, but there is no specific timeline provided for when the recall will be officially closed.\n\nGiven the information available, it is not possible to definitively predict whether the recall will be closed before December 31, 2024, as this depends on various factors such as the efficiency of the recall process, consumer compliance, and ongoing FSIS monitoring. Therefore, the answer to whether the recall will be closed by December 31, 2024, is not immediately clear.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any reports of adverse reactions related to Pork Dynasty Inc.'s recalled products as of today?\nANSWER: NO\n\nAs of the latest information available, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to the consumption of the recalled products from Pork Dynasty Inc..\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average time for the USDA to close a Class I recall less than three months?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specify the average time it takes for the USDA to close a Class I recall. They detail the procedures, classifications, and steps involved in the recall process, but they do not provide specific timelines for the completion of recalls.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there no ongoing investigations into additional issues with Pork Dynasty Inc.'s products?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of ongoing investigations into additional issues with Pork Dynasty Inc.'s products beyond the recall announced due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen (soy).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the FSIS closed similar-sized recalls (approximately 469 pounds) within three months in the past?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether the FSIS has specifically closed recalls of similar sizes (approximately 469 pounds) within a three-month period in the past.\n\nThe sources detail various recalls, including the one by Pork Dynasty for 469 pounds of ready-to-eat fried pork skin products, but they do not provide a comprehensive historical context of recall sizes and their closure timelines.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any recent updates indicating delays in closing the recall of Pork Dynasty Inc.'s products?\nANSWER: There are no recent updates indicating delays in closing the recall of Pork Dynasty Inc.'s products. The sources provided detail the recall and its reasons, but they do not mention any delays in the recall process. The latest update mentioned is from October 3, 2024, which clarified that the products were also shipped to Oklahoma, but it does not indicate any delays.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous USDA recalls due to undeclared soy allergens been closed within three months?\nANSWER: The information provided does not specify the exact timeline for the closure of USDA recalls due to undeclared soy allergens. While several recalls involving undeclared soy are mentioned, such as the recall of Gordon Choice Homestyle Chili Topping and Tim Heung Yuen Black Melon Seed, the sources do not provide details on how long it took to close these specific recalls.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is **UNCLEAR** whether previous USDA recalls due to undeclared soy allergens have been closed within three months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a standard timeframe in which the FSIS aims to close recalls after initiating them?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no standard timeframe specified by the FSIS for closing recalls after initiating them.\n\n- The sources indicate that FSIS monitors and oversees voluntary recalls, conducts effectiveness checks, and tracks various aspects of the recall process, but they do not mention specific timeframes for closing recalls.\n- FSIS determines when to close a recall based on criteria such as no additional illnesses associated with the recalled product, no signs that the recalled product remains in commerce, and sufficient efforts by firms, but this does not imply a fixed timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the recalled product distributed only within Texas and Oklahoma?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe recalled products from both AdvancePierre Foods and BrucePac were not distributed only within Texas and Oklahoma.\n\n- The recall by AdvancePierre Foods involved distribution to food service establishments in multiple states, including Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Virginia.\n- The recall by BrucePac involved distribution nationwide to restaurants, institutions, and other establishments across the country, including various grocery chains and schools.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Pork Dynasty Inc. have a history of compliance with USDA recall procedures?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no comprehensive history of Pork Dynasty Inc.'s compliance with USDA recall procedures beyond the specific incident described. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources detail a recent recall of Pork Dynasty Inc.'s ready-to-eat fried pork skin products due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, which was identified during routine FSIS verification activities.\n- There is no mention of previous recalls or a broader history of compliance with USDA recall procedures.\n\nTherefore, the information available is insufficient to determine whether Pork Dynasty Inc. has a consistent history of compliance with USDA recall procedures.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Pork Dynasty Inc. cooperating fully with the FSIS in the recall process?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it appears that Pork Dynasty Inc. is cooperating with the FSIS in the recall process. Here are some key points that indicate cooperation:\n\n- The recall was initiated after the FSIS discovered the issue during routine in-plant verification activities, and Pork Dynasty Inc. is listed as the company conducting the recall.\n- The company has provided contact information for consumers to inquire about the recall, and the owner, Wilson Gaw, is available for further comments.\n- The FSIS has outlined steps that consumers should take, such as not consuming the products, disposing of them, or returning them to the point of purchase, which suggests that the company is following FSIS guidelines.\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that Pork Dynasty Inc. is cooperating fully with the FSIS in the recall process.\n\nYES", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately 71 days left until December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf the recall process proceeds as expected with no significant delays or complications, it is likely that the recall would be closed before December 31, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about 18 days left until the deadline, I would estimate a lower probability that the recall would be closed before December 31, 2024, due to the shorter timeframe for the necessary procedures to be completed.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately 284 days until the deadline, I would have a higher confidence that the recall would be closed before December 31, 2024, as there would be ample time to complete all necessary steps.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe recall of Pork Dynasty Inc.'s Ready-to-Eat Fried Pork Skin Products was initiated on September 27, 2024, due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen (soy). The recall involves a relatively small quantity of product (approximately 469 pounds) distributed to retail and restaurant locations in Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nKey factors influencing the probability:\n\n- **Company Cooperation:** Pork Dynasty Inc. is reportedly cooperating fully with the FSIS in the recall process, which facilitates timely resolution.\n- **No Adverse Reactions Reported:** There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions, reducing the urgency but also indicating effective communication with consumers.\n- **No Ongoing Investigations:** There are no indications of additional issues or investigations that might delay the recall closure.\n- **Typical Recall Timelines:** While specific average closure times for USDA recalls are not provided, recalls of similar scale and nature are often closed within a few months.\n\nGiven these factors, it is reasonable to expect that the recall could be closed before December 31, 2024. However, due to uncertainties such as lack of explicit data on closure timelines and potential unforeseen delays (e.g., logistical challenges, compliance issues), there is still some risk that the recall might remain active past the deadline.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 75%**", "probability": 75}
