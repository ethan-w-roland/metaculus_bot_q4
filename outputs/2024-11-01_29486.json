    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill it rain more than 100mm in Bras칤lia, Brazil in December 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves based on the amount of measured and recorded cumulative rainfall (in millimeters) at the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET) weather station [83377] BRASILIA - DF for the month of December 2024.\n\nDETAILED INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n1. Go to the INMET weather station map [here](https://mapas.inmet.gov.br/).\n2. Click the 游댌search icon on the left side of the screen.\n3. Paste this into the search box: [83377] BRASILIA - DF\n4. Click on the blue dot to access the weather station.\n\nTo access the precipitation data, click on \"Tabela\". The question will resolve based on the total *Chuva (mm)* for the month of December 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf the resolution source is unavailable or data have not been released for every day of December, resolution will wait until January 7, 2025 for the data to be available, at which point if they still are not available, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nThis question resolves based on the values shown when accessed by Metaculus after the data for December 31 are first released. Further revisions to the data will not be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBras칤lia, the capital city of Brazil, has [just had rain](https://brazilian.report/liveblog/politics-insider/2024/10/07/brasilia-longest-drought-ever/) after a record-breaking drought, characterized by 167 consecutive days of no rain. September 2024 was the [hottest September on record](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/noticias/brasil-tem-o-setembro-mais-quente-em-63-anos) for the area, and INMET expects 2024 to be one of the top 5 hottest years, which has also caused a surge in wildfires.\n\nDecember is typically the [wettest month](https://avionero.com/New-York-Brasilia.NYC-BSB/weather/december) for Bras칤lia, with rain averaging about 253 mm and an average of 21 rainy days in the month. See also [Weatherspark](https://weatherspark.com/y/30238/Average-Weather-in-Bras%C3%ADlia-Federal-District-Brazil-Year-Round), which found an average of about 215 mm and about 75% of days having at least 1 mm of rain.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine the likelihood of rainfall exceeding 100mm in Bras칤lia, Brazil in December 2024, here are some key points from the available data:\n\n## Rainfall in December\n- December is one of the wettest months in Bras칤lia. The average monthly rainfall in December is approximately 261mm, according to weather2travel.\n- The average sliding 31-day rainfall during December remains constant at about 8.4 inches (around 213mm), rarely exceeding 12.8 inches (around 325mm).\n\n## Frequency of Rainy Days\n- There are usually 26 days with some rain in Bras칤lia during December.\n\n## Historical Data\n- The wettest months in Bras칤lia are typically December and January, with monthly rainfall often exceeding 200mm.\n\nGiven these points, it is highly likely that the rainfall in Bras칤lia in December 2024 will exceed 100mm. The average monthly rainfall is significantly higher than 100mm, and the historical data consistently shows December as one of the wettest months.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer to whether it will rain more than 100mm in Bras칤lia, Brazil in December 2024 is **yes**.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Bras칤lia experienced a prolonged drought leading up to November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nBras칤lia, the capital of Brazil, has experienced a record-breaking drought leading up to November 2024. The city endured 167 consecutive days without rain, surpassing the previous record set in 1963. This drought finally ended with rainfall on October 7, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the average December rainfall in Bras칤lia over the past 10 years greater than 100mm?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the average December rainfall in Bras칤lia can be determined from the following data:\n\n- From the source on Brasilia's weather in December, it is mentioned that the average rainfall in December is 253 mm.\n\nSince 253 mm is significantly greater than 100 mm, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have meteorological forecasts predicted above-average rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific prediction for above-average rainfall in Bras칤lia for December 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss general climate outlooks for the U.S. and global ENSO conditions, but they do not provide detailed forecasts for specific cities like Bras칤lia.\n- The source related to Bras칤lia's climate does not include specific forecasts for December 2024, only general climate patterns.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the INMET weather station [83377] BRASILIA - DF currently operational and recording data accurately?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the INMET weather station [83377] BRASILIA - DF is not operational or that it is not recording data accurately. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- The station is listed in the INMET database and is included in graphical climate data presentations, which suggests it is active.\n- There is no mention of any current service interruptions or issues with the station's operation in the sources provided.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been years in the last decade when December rainfall in Bras칤lia was less than 100mm?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data breaking down the rainfall in Bras칤lia for each year of the last decade. However, the sources do provide general averages and some historical data.\n\n- The average rainfall in December for Bras칤lia is typically around 240-253 mm, which is well above 100 mm.\n- There is a mention of the driest year in 2019, but this is for the annual rainfall (963 mm), not specifically for December.\n\nGiven the lack of specific yearly data for December rainfall in the last decade, we cannot definitively say whether there were years with less than 100 mm of rainfall in December.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is December historically the wettest month in Bras칤lia, Brazil?\nANSWER: Yes, December is historically one of the wettest months in Bras칤lia, Brazil. Here are the sources that confirm this:\n\n- According to the data from Weatherspark, December in Bras칤lia has a high rainfall amount, with the month experiencing its maximum daily chance of a wet day and significant rainfall accumulation.\n- Sunheron indicates that December is the month when the rainfall amount reaches its maximum, with 252 mm (9.92 in) of rainfall and the highest number of rainy days.\n- Climatestotravel also states that December is the wettest month, with 240 mm (9.4 in) of rainfall and 19 rainy days on average.\n- World Weather Online mentions that December and January are typically the wettest months, with monthly rainfall often exceeding 200 millimeters (7.9 inches).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are short-term weather forecasts predicting significant rainfall for Bras칤lia in early December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the long-term weather averages and climate data provided, it is unclear whether short-term weather forecasts are predicting significant rainfall for Bras칤lia in early December 2024. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- Bras칤lia typically experiences a significant amount of rainfall in December, with average monthly rainfall ranging from 261 mm to 253 mm.\n- December is one of the wettest months, with around 26-27 days of rainfall expected.\n\nHowever, these sources provide long-term averages and do not offer real-time or short-term weather forecasts. To determine if there will be significant rainfall in early December 2024 specifically, you would need to consult a current, short-term weather forecast.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is an El Ni침o or La Ni침a event occurring in 2024 that could affect rainfall in Bras칤lia?\nANSWER: As of the current information, neither an El Ni침o nor a La Ni침a event is currently occurring, but there is a forecast suggesting that a La Ni침a event might develop later in 2024.\n\n- The tropical Pacific Ocean is currently in a neutral state of the El Ni침o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as of mid-August and September 2024.\n- Forecasters predict a possible transition to La Ni침a, with approximately a 55-60% chance of La Ni침a developing in the September-November period.\n\nTherefore, while there is no ongoing El Ni침o or La Ni침a event at present, there is a significant chance that a La Ni침a event could develop and potentially affect rainfall patterns, including in Bras칤lia, by the end of the year.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as to whether it is currently occurring, but likely to develop)\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are climate models indicating a decrease in rainfall for Bras칤lia in December 2024 due to climate change?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information that directly addresses the prediction of rainfall in Bras칤lia for December 2024 using climate models.\n\n- The CLIMBra dataset described in the first source provides historical and future climate projections for Brazil, but it does not specify predictions for a particular month like December 2024.\n- The second source discusses deforestation-induced changes in rainfall patterns, but it does not provide specific projections for Bras칤lia in December 2024.\n- The third source provides general weather patterns for Bras칤lia in December, based on historical data, but does not include future climate model predictions.\n- The fourth and fifth sources discuss broader climate change impacts and extreme weather events in Brazil, but do not offer specific rainfall predictions for Bras칤lia in December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent environmental factors, such as wildfires, impacted rainfall patterns in Bras칤lia?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nRecent environmental factors, including the widespread wildfires, have contributed to and are intertwined with the disruption of rainfall patterns in Brazil, which includes the region around Bras칤lia.\n\n- The severe drought affecting Brazil, described as the worst in at least 70 years, has been exacerbated by low rainfall since the end of the previous year. This drought is linked to broader climate change and El Ni침o phenomena, which impact rainfall patterns.\n- Deforestation and the resulting wildfires have thrown the ecosystem off balance, leading to a reduction in rainfall. This is particularly noted in the Amazon region, which is crucial for regulating Brazil's rainfall.\n- The combination of high temperatures, low humidity, and strong winds, all of which are exacerbated by climate change and human activities, has created conditions that are highly favorable for wildfires and detrimental to normal rainfall patterns.\n\nThese factors collectively indicate that recent environmental conditions, including wildfires, have indeed impacted rainfall patterns in the region around Bras칤lia.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 2 months. The data for December 2024 will be available by early January 2025.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If historical patterns hold and nothing unexpected occurs, December would receive significantly more than 100mm of rainfall. The average December rainfall in Bras칤lia is between 240mm and 260mm.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With less time left (about two weeks before January), and assuming typical weather patterns, the probability of exceeding 100mm would likely be slightly higher, perhaps around 90%, due to reduced time for anomalies to affect the outcome.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** With more time (about 8 months), uncertainty increases due to the potential for unforeseen climatic events. The probability might decrease slightly, perhaps to around 80%.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Averages:** December is historically the wettest month in Bras칤lia, with average rainfall consistently exceeding 200mm. The base rate for December rainfall surpassing 100mm is very high.\n\n- **Recent Drought Ending:** The record-breaking drought of 167 consecutive days without rain ended on October 7, 2024. This indicates a shift from the dry season to the wet season, which typically begins in October or November.\n\n- **Seasonal Patterns:** The transition from the dry to the wet season suggests that rainfall will increase in the coming months. December, being the peak of the wet season, is expected to receive substantial rainfall.\n\n- **Climate Factors:** While 2024 has been unusually hot, leading to drought and wildfires, there are no specific forecasts indicating that December 2024 will be significantly drier than average.\n\n- **El Ni침o/La Ni침a Influence:** There is a possibility of a La Ni침a event developing. La Ni침a can affect rainfall patterns, but its impact on central Brazil, including Bras칤lia, can vary. There is no clear indication that it will drastically reduce December rainfall.\n\n- **Recent Trends vs. Base Rates:** Although recent months have seen extreme weather conditions, the strong historical average for December rainfall suggests that exceeding 100mm is still likely.\n\n- **Uncertainties:** Climate change introduces uncertainties, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. This slightly lowers confidence compared to historical norms.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
