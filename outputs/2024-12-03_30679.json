    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the average daily temperature for December 2024 recorded by the Barrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station (on the Arctic coast of Alaska) exceed the 1945-2023 average for December by ≥6 degrees F?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-03\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the average daily temperature for December 2024 recorded by the Barrow/Port Rogers National Weather Service weather station in Alaska exceeds the 1945-2023 average for December by ≥6 degrees Fahrenheit. Specifically, it will be the figure for December 2024 under \"Average Daily Temperature (high+low)/2 [F]\" listed at [this webpage](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/monthlysum.php?station=PABR&network=AK_ASOS) by Iowa Environmental Mesonet.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that Iowa Environmental Mesonet is the only data provider that will be used for resolution. The specific link to the webpage within the resolution source's website is provided for convenience, but if the resolution data is at a different page at the resolution source, then that page will be used for resolution.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the [Arctic Council](https://arctic-council.org/explore/topics/climate/), \"The temperatures in the Arctic continue to rise at three times the global annual average, driving many of the changes underway in the Arctic. Most prominently, snow and ice are melting at an increasing rate. This impacts both local ecosystems and the global climate system. It contributes to rising sea levels, and is likely to provoke extreme temperature events beyond the Arctic. The effects of a shifting Arctic climate are felt across the high latitudes and beyond – with global environmental, economic, and social implications.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the average daily temperature for December 2024 at the Barrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station (Barrow Airport, AK) exceeding the 1945-2023 average by ≥6 degrees F, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Historical Temperature Trends\n- The Barrow Airport weather station has a long period of record starting from 1901, providing a robust dataset for historical temperature analysis[4].\n- Arctic regions are experiencing more rapid climate change than lower latitudes, with significant increases in temperatures over recent decades[2].\n\n## Average Temperatures\n- The average December temperatures at Barrow, Alaska, are typically very cold. For example, the average high temperature in December is around -12°C (10°F), and the average low temperature is around -22°C (-8°F)[4].\n\n## Climate Change Impact\n- The Arctic is warming at a rate that is approximately twice as fast as the global average. This trend suggests that temperatures in the Arctic, including Barrow, are likely to continue rising[2].\n\n## Variability and Anomalies\n- While long-term trends indicate warming, there can be significant year-to-year variability in Arctic temperatures. However, the overall trend is towards warmer conditions, especially in winter months[2].\n\n## Specific Temperature Increases\n- To exceed the 1945-2023 average by ≥6 degrees F, the average daily temperature for December 2024 would need to be significantly higher than usual. Given the rapid warming in the Arctic, such an increase is not entirely implausible, but it would still be an unusually large anomaly.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The base rate for such large temperature anomalies in the Arctic is relatively low, but the region's rapid warming increases the likelihood of extreme temperature events.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Arctic is experiencing rapid warming, an increase of ≥6 degrees F above the historical average for December is still a significant deviation. The answer to whether this will happen is not immediately clear and would depend on specific weather patterns and climate conditions in December 2024. Therefore, it cannot be clearly answered as yes or no without additional forecasting data.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent climate models predicted a significant rise in December temperatures for Barrow Airport?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information regarding recent climate models' predictions for December temperatures in Barrow, Alaska. The sources provide historical climate data and average weather conditions but do not discuss future climate model predictions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any extreme weather events affecting Barrow, Alaska, in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about extreme weather events affecting Barrow, Alaska, in December 2024. The sources discuss general climate trends, past events, and winter outlooks, but they do not provide details about specific weather events in December 2024 for Barrow, Alaska.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a long-term trend of increasing December temperatures at Barrow Airport, Alaska?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence of a long-term trend of increasing December temperatures at Barrow Airport, Alaska.\n\n- The sources provide detailed climate averages and historical data for December temperatures in Barrow, but they do not specifically analyze or mention any long-term trends of increasing temperatures for this month[1][2][4].\n- The data presented are mostly averages and historical records, which do not indicate a clear upward trend in December temperatures over the years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Barrow Airport experienced any temperature anomalies in November 2024?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not contain specific information about temperature anomalies at Barrow Island Airport for November 2024. The sources discuss climate data for Western Australia in 2023, climate reports for the United States in April 2024, the geography and climate of Ireland, and long-range weather forecasts for the winter of 2024-2025, but none of these sources provide data or forecasts specific to Barrow Island Airport in November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the December 2024 forecast for Barrow Airport showing a warming pattern?\nANSWER: No, the December 2024 forecast for Barrow, Alaska, does not indicate a warming pattern. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- The forecast shows extremely cold temperatures, with daytime maximum temperatures expected to be around -21°C and nighttime minimum temperatures around -27°C[1][2].\n- There is no indication of above-average temperatures for the region; instead, the forecasts highlight very cold and snowy conditions, which is consistent with the typical winter weather in Barrow[1][2].\n- The overall winter outlook, influenced by a potential La Niña event, does not suggest warmer-than-normal temperatures for northern Alaska, including Barrow[4][5].\n\nTherefore, the forecast does not show a warming pattern for Barrow in December 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have global greenhouse gas emissions increased in 2024 compared to previous years?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nGlobal greenhouse gas emissions have increased in 2024 compared to previous years. According to the 2024 Global Carbon Budget, fossil CO₂ emissions are projected to rise by 0.8% in 2024, reaching a record 37.4 billion tonnes of CO₂, which is higher than the previous record set in 2023. Total CO₂ emissions, including both fossil and land-use emissions, are also expected to reach a new record at 41.6 billion tonnes, up 2% from 2023 levels[1][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the sea ice extent around Barrow, Alaska, significantly reduced in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the information about the specific sea ice extent around Barrow, Alaska, in 2024 is not directly addressed. However, the sources do provide broader context about Arctic sea ice extent in 2024.\n\n- The Arctic sea ice extent as a whole reached its seventh lowest minimum in the satellite record in 2024, with a minimum extent of 4.28 million square kilometers on September 11, 2024[1][3][2].\n- The sources discuss the general decline in Arctic sea ice, including significant losses in various regions such as the Beaufort Sea, eastern Hudson Bay, and the Siberian coast[1][2][3].\n\nWhile these sources indicate a significant reduction in Arctic sea ice extent overall, they do not provide specific data or analysis focused solely on the area around Barrow, Alaska. Therefore, the answer to whether the sea ice extent around Barrow, Alaska, is significantly reduced in 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is an El Niño event occurring in 2024?\nANSWER: No, the El Niño event of 2023-2024 is forecasted to end in 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The 2023/24 El Niño event is showing signs of ending, with forecasters estimating an 85% chance that El Niño will end and the tropical Pacific will transition to neutral conditions by the April–June period[3].\n- By early March 2024, the El Niño event was already in full retreat, indicated by pockets of below average Sea Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies in the equatorial East Pacific[4].\n- The forecasts suggest a transition to either ENSO-neutral conditions or potentially to La Niña later in the year[2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Arctic amplification continuing to affect Barrow, Alaska, in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that Arctic amplification, which refers to the enhanced warming in the Arctic compared to the global average, is an ongoing process.\n\n- The sources indicate that the Arctic, including areas like Barrow (now known as Utqiagvik), is experiencing rapid and continued warming due to climate change. For example, the Arctic is warming faster than the global mean, and this trend is expected to continue through the 21st century[1][3][5].\n\n- Specific to Barrow, Alaska, the region has seen significant warming, especially during autumn months, and changes in snow cycles and sea ice conditions are well-documented[1][2].\n\n- The recent extreme temperatures and climate-related events in the Arctic, including those in northern Alaska, further support the ongoing impact of Arctic amplification in the region[3].\n\nTherefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Arctic amplification is indeed continuing to affect Barrow, Alaska, in 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Was the December temperature at Barrow Airport in 2023 above the 1945-2023 average?\nANSWER: To determine if the December temperature at Barrow Airport in 2023 was above the 1945-2023 average, we need to compare the 2023 temperatures with the long-term averages.\n\n### Average Temperatures\n- The long-term average temperature for December in Barrow is around -2°F, with an average high of 2°F and an average low of -4°F[1].\n\n### 2023 Temperatures\n- The daily temperatures for December 2023 are provided in several sources. Here are some examples:\n  - On December 1, 2023, the temperature ranged from 9°F to 14°F[1].\n  - Throughout the month, temperatures generally fluctuated between lows of around -13°F to highs of up to 14°F, but mostly stayed below 0°F[1][3].\n\n### Comparison\n- Given that the temperatures in December 2023 were often below 0°F and sometimes dropped as low as -13°F, it is clear that these temperatures were generally in line with or even lower than the long-term average temperatures for the month.\n\nBased on this analysis, the December temperature at Barrow Airport in 2023 was not above the 1945-2023 average; it was either at or below the average.\n\n**NO**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n28 days (the remainder of December 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf current conditions persisted without any significant deviations, the average daily temperature for December 2024 at the Barrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station would align closely with the historical 1945-2023 December average. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**, the average would **not** exceed the historical average by ≥6°F.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith only 7 days remaining in December, short-term weather patterns would predominantly influence the outcome. Given the lack of indications from subquestions such as no significant warming patterns in forecasts and unclear links between recent climate anomalies and the required temperature increase, the probability of exceeding the historical average by ≥6°F remains low. **Forecast: 5%**\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nAssuming 112 days (extending the timeframe beyond the typical December period), the influence of long-term climate trends and Arctic amplification would be more pronounced. However, since the question specifically pertains to December 2024, extending the timeframe doesn't directly impact the December average. Nevertheless, considering continued Arctic warming trends, there might be a slightly increased probability, but still constrained by the magnitude of the required temperature anomaly. **Forecast: 10%**\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe Barrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station in Alaska records historically cold December temperatures, averaging around 10°F high and -8°F low. An increase of ≥6°F above this average represents a significant anomaly. While Arctic amplification indicates a trend of rising temperatures, the required increase is substantial, especially given the current climate forecasts indicating typical winter conditions without a warming spike.\n\nSubquestions reveal that:\n- There are no specific climate model predictions suggesting such a large temperature increase for December 2024 in Barrow.\n- The December 2024 forecast does not indicate a warming pattern.\n- There is high uncertainty regarding extreme weather events and specific regional sea ice conditions that could influence temperatures drastically.\n\nGiven the base rates of such significant anomalies are low and immediate forecasts do not support a drastic temperature rise, the probability remains minimal despite ongoing Arctic warming trends.\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
