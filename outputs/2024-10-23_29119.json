Keep an eye on this key factor (beyond just losing)](https://www.nj.com/giants/2024/09/will-giants-fire-brian-daboll-joe-schoen-keep-an-eye-on-this-key-factor-beyond-just-losing.html)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Brian Daboll ceasing to be the New York Giants head coach before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Current Role and Decisions\nBrian Daboll has taken over the play-calling duties for the Giants' offense in the 2024 season, a significant change from the previous two seasons when Mike Kafka handled these duties. This move indicates Daboll's increased involvement and responsibility for the team's offensive performance.\n\n## Performance Pressure\nThe 2024 season is crucial for Daboll and his regime, especially after a disappointing 6-11 record in the 2023 season. The team's performance this season will likely determine Daboll's future as the head coach. Daboll himself has acknowledged the pressure, stating he is responsible for everything, including the offense, defense, and special teams.\n\n## Coaching History and Stability\nDaboll is the first Giants head coach since Tom Coughlin to enter a third season. His first season was highly successful, earning him the 2022 NFL Coach of the Year award, but the second season was a significant setback. This pattern suggests that the Giants might be willing to give him another chance to turn things around, but continued poor performance could lead to a reevaluation of his position.\n\n## Organizational Changes and Support\nDespite internal tensions and coaching staff changes, Daboll has made significant adjustments to the team's structure and approach. He has the support of his staff, including Mike Kafka, who has been promoted to assistant head coach and is now focusing on supporting Daboll rather than calling plays.\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\nHistorically, NFL head coaches who experience a sharp decline in performance after an initial successful season can face increased scrutiny and potential dismissal. However, the decision to fire a head coach also depends on various factors, including the team's overall health, the presence of a suitable replacement, and the general manager's and ownership's confidence in the coach.\n\nGiven these points, while there is significant pressure on Daboll to perform well in the 2024 season, it is not immediately clear whether he will cease to be the head coach before January 1, 2025. The outcome will depend on the team's performance over the remainder of the season and the organizational decisions that follow.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Brian Daboll currently the head coach of the New York Giants?\nANSWER: YES\n\nBrian Daboll is currently the head coach of the New York Giants, as indicated in multiple sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the New York Giants fired a head coach after two consecutive losing seasons in the past?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe New York Giants fired head coach Joe Judge after two consecutive losing seasons, as evidenced by his career record of 10-23 and the team's performance during his tenure.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Brian Daboll won the NFL Coach of the Year award in the past?\nANSWER: YES, Brian Daboll has won the NFL Coach of the Year award.

It highlights the high expectations and the potential for a coaching change if the team does not improve.\n\n- A YouTube video from Chat Sports features host Marshall Green discussing the need to fire Brian Daboll, citing repeated mistakes such as playing an injured kicker without a backup plan and questioning Daboll's ability to elevate the franchise.\n\n- Another YouTube video also from Chat Sports reiterates the growing speculation and rumors about Daboll and General Manager Joe Schoen being on the hot seat, with some calling for their dismissal.\n\n- A discussion on Big Blue Interactive further emphasizes the frustration among fans and the perception that Daboll may not have full control over decisions, particularly regarding the quarterback position, which adds to the pressure on him.\n\nThese sources collectively indicate a significant amount of media and fan pressure for the New York Giants to consider firing Brian Daboll.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\nApproximately 69 days remain until January 1, 2025, from today's date, October 23, 2024.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf nothing changed, Brian Daboll would continue as the head coach of the New York Giants through January 1, 2025.\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith about 17 days left until January 1, 2025, the probability of Brian Daboll ceasing to be head coach before that date would be lower, around **15%**.\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nIf there were approximately 276 days until January 1, 2025 (hypothetically starting from around April 2024), the probability would be higher, around **40%**, due to the additional time for events to influence the outcome.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of October 23, 2024, Brian Daboll remains the head coach of the New York Giants. The team currently holds a 2-5 record in the 2024 NFL season, indicating underperformance. Significant media and fan pressure exists for the Giants to consider a coaching change. Reports highlight internal strife, criticism of Daboll's decision-making, and doubts about his ability to improve the team's fortunes.\n\n**Factors Considered:**\n\n- **Media and Fan Pressure:** There is substantial public discourse suggesting dissatisfaction with Daboll's coaching. Multiple sources indicate calls for his dismissal due to the team's performance and questionable decisions.\n\n- **Organizational Precedent:** The Giants have a history of firing coaches after consecutive losing seasons, as seen with Joe Judge's dismissal following a 10-23 record over two seasons.\n\n- **Mid-Season Firings in the NFL:** While less common than offseason changes, mid-season firings do occur, especially when a team is significantly underperforming. Examples include Urban Meyer's firing by the Jaguars (December 16, 2021) and Matt Rhule's dismissal by the Panthers (October 10, 2022).\n\n- **Remaining Season Dynamics:** With about 10 games left in the regular season, the team's performance in the coming weeks is crucial. A continued losing streak could increase the likelihood of a coaching change before January 1, 2025.\n\n- **Management's Stance:** Despite the pressures, there is no clear public indication from the Giants' ownership or management expressing dissatisfaction with Daboll during the 2024 season. Organizational support can play a significant role in a coach's job security.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the above factors, there is a moderate chance that Brian Daboll will cease to be the head coach before January 1, 2025. The combination of poor team performance, media and fan pressure, and organizational precedents for firing coaches after losing seasons contribute to this assessment. However, the absence of explicit dissatisfaction from ownership and the potential for the team to improve mean that it's not a certainty.\n\n**Probability: 25%**", "probability": 25}
