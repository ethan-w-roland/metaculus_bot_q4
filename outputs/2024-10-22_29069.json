If there is still music by Diddy available at that page when accessed by Metaculus on or after January 2, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf there no longer is a Spotify profile page for Diddy at all, this question resolves as **No**. For purposes of this question, any stage name known to refer to Combs, such as \"Diddy\" or \"Puff Daddy\" will count. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nTime Magazine September 20, 2024: [Diddy\u2019s in Exile. Here\u2019s What Could Happen to His Music Now](https://time.com/7023138/sean-diddy-combs-music-back-catalog/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Spotify will remove rapper Diddy's songs from his Spotify page before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Actions Against Diddy\nAs of September 2024, Diddy became the first artist to have his music removed from Spotify's editorial playlists and algorithmic recommendations due to recent allegations and charges against him. However, this does not necessarily mean his music will be completely removed from the platform.\n\n## Precedent with R. Kelly\nA similar situation occurred with R. Kelly, where his music was removed from Spotify\u2019s editorial playlists and algorithmic recommendations in 2018, but his music remained available on the platform. After his conviction in 2021, his official channels and music videos were deleted from YouTube, but user-generated content and his music on other platforms like Spotify and TikTok were not removed.\n\n## Spotify's Policies\nSpotify's policy on removing music is typically based on specific criteria such as \"hateful content and conduct.\" While Diddy's music has been de-promoted, there is no clear indication that his entire catalog will be removed from the platform. The decision to remove an artist's music entirely is usually made after a thorough review and often follows legal convictions or severe public backlash.\n\n## No Clear Indication of Complete Removal\nAs of the current information, there is no definitive statement from Spotify indicating that Diddy's songs will be completely removed from his Spotify page. The actions so far have been focused on de-promoting his music rather than a full removal.\n\nGiven these points, it is not clear whether Spotify will remove Diddy's songs from his Spotify page before January 1, 2025. The decision would depend on various factors, including any further developments in the allegations against Diddy, Spotify's internal policies, and public reaction. Therefore, the answer to this question cannot be definitively stated as yes or no based on the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Diddy himself requested the removal of his music from Spotify?\nANSWER: No, there is no indication that Diddy himself has requested the removal of his music from Spotify. In fact, the sources indicate that his music is still available on several major streaming services, including Spotify, despite the ongoing legal troubles and public scrutiny.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Diddy's record label requested the removal of his music from Spotify?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provided do not contain any information indicating that Diddy's record label has requested the removal of his music from Spotify. The discussions in the sources are about various other topics, including Neil Young's request to remove his music from Spotify, public opinions on removing artists' music, and issues related to music streaming and royalties, but they do not mention any action by Diddy or his label regarding the removal of his music from Spotify.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Spotify updated its policies in a way that would make it more likely to remove Diddy's music?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no indication that Spotify has updated its policies to make it more likely to remove Diddy's music. The Daily Beast article mentions that Spotify does not seem to be planning to remove Diddy's music in light of recent events, but it does not discuss any policy changes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Diddy been convicted of any crimes since September 2024?\nANSWER: NO\n\nAs of the current date, October 22, 2024, there is no indication in the provided sources that Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has been convicted of any crimes. He is currently awaiting trial, which is scheduled to commence on May 5 of the next year, and has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Spotify publicly stated that it is considering removing Diddy's music from his Spotify page?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication that Spotify has publicly stated it is considering removing Diddy's music from his Spotify page.\n\n- The Daily Beast article mentions that Spotify was contacted about the possibility of removing Diddy's music, but it does not state that Spotify is considering or planning to do so.\n- The other sources do not provide any information on Spotify's official stance regarding the removal of Diddy's music.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any new severe allegations against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs emerged since September 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nSince September 2024, numerous new severe allegations have emerged against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. These include multiple federal civil lawsuits alleging sexual assault, rape, and other forms of sexual misconduct spanning from 2000 to 2022. The allegations involve incidents at gatherings hosted by Combs in various locations such as New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, and some of these lawsuits also implicate other unnamed celebrities as accomplices in the alleged assaults.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Spotify ever completely removed an artist's music from its platform due to allegations or charges against the artist?\nANSWER: No, Spotify has not completely removed an artist's music from its platform due to allegations or charges against the artist. However, Spotify has taken steps to reduce the visibility and promotion of such artists.\n\nFor example, in the case of R. Kelly and XXXTentacion, Spotify removed their music from its playlists and algorithmic recommendations due to allegations of sexual abuse and domestic violence, but their music remained available on the platform.\n\nIn cases of alleged fraudulent streaming activity, some artists have had their music removed, but this is typically due to actions taken by distributors in response to notifications from Spotify, rather than Spotify itself completely removing the music as a direct result of allegations against the artist.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major music streaming platforms removed Diddy's music from their services?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that while some platforms have taken action regarding Diddy's music, not all major music streaming platforms have removed his music entirely.\n\n- Peloton has paused the use of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' music and removed the Bad Boy Entertainment Artist Series from its platform.\n- Radio stations, including those under Audacy and iHeartRadio, have stopped playing Diddy's music.\n- However, there is no indication that major music streaming services like Spotify, Amazon Music, or Soundcloud have completely removed Diddy's music. In fact, some sources suggest that his streaming numbers on these platforms have seen an increase or mixed results.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant public pressure or campaigns demanding that Spotify remove Diddy's music?\nANSWER: There is significant public and corporate pressure, though it may not be universally coordinated as a single campaign, demanding that Spotify and other music platforms take action regarding Diddy's music following recent allegations.\n\n- Corporate partners such as Revolt, Hulu, and Peloton have severed ties with Diddy following the allegations, indicating a level of public and corporate backlash.\n- While music platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, TIDAL, and YouTube have not removed Diddy's music, there is ongoing discussion and scrutiny about whether they should take such action. This includes comments from industry figures and public opinion that his music legacy is likely to be affected by the allegations.\n\nHowever, it is not clear if there is a unified, large-scale public campaign specifically demanding Spotify to remove Diddy's music, but there is certainly significant public and industry pressure. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any legal obligations that would compel Spotify to remove Diddy's music from his Spotify page?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are no legal obligations that would compel Spotify to remove Diddy's music from his Spotify page at this time.\n\n- Spotify has a policy against \"hateful content and conduct,\" but this policy typically results in the music not being actively promoted on editorial playlists and algorithmic recommendations, rather than being completely removed from the platform. This is evident from the example of R. Kelly, whose music is still available on Spotify but not actively promoted.\n- Despite the serious allegations and charges against Diddy, music platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and YouTube have not removed his music from their platforms. Instead, they have remained silent on the matter.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nAs of today, October 22, 2024, there are approximately 71 days left until January 1, 2025, when the question resolves.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and January 1, 2025, Diddy's songs would remain available on his Spotify page, and the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about 18 days left until the resolution date, I would estimate a very low probability that Spotify would remove Diddy's songs in that short time frame, perhaps around **10%**.\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nIf there were roughly 284 days left (extending the deadline to around August 2025), the probability of Spotify removing Diddy's songs might increase, depending on future developments, potentially estimating around **25%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSeveral factors influence the likelihood of Spotify removing Diddy's songs from his Spotify page before January 1, 2025:\n\n1. **Spotify's Historical Actions:**\n   - **Precedent with Other Artists:** In similar cases involving serious allegations, such as with R. Kelly and XXXTentacion, Spotify has opted to remove the artists' music from editorial playlists and algorithmic recommendations but did not remove their music entirely from the platform.\n   - **Policy on Content Removal:** Spotify's policy generally requires legal convictions or content that violates specific guidelines (e.g., hate speech) to justify complete removal. As of now, Diddy has not been convicted of any crimes.\n\n2. **Current Status of Diddy's Music on Spotify:**\n   - **De-Promotion but Not Removal:** Diddy's music has been de-promoted on Spotify, meaning it has been removed from playlists and algorithmic recommendations. However, his songs remain accessible on his Spotify page.\n   - **No Official Statements from Spotify:** There has been no public indication or official statement from Spotify suggesting plans to remove Diddy's music entirely.\n\n3. **Legal Proceedings:**\n   - **Awaiting Trial:** Diddy is currently awaiting trial, scheduled to commence on May 5, 2025. He has pleaded not guilty to the allegations against him.\n   - **No Convictions to Date:** Without a legal conviction, Spotify is less likely to take the drastic step of removing his music outright.\n\n4. **Public and Corporate Pressure:**\n   - **Actions by Other Companies:** Some companies, like Peloton and certain radio stations, have paused the use of Diddy's music or stopped playing it altogether.\n   - **Public Backlash:** There is growing public scrutiny and discussion about the allegations, but no widespread, coordinated campaign specifically demanding Spotify remove his music.\n\n5. **Time Frame Constraints:**\n   - **Limited Time Before Resolution Date:** With just over two months remaining until January 1, 2025, significant developments would need to occur rapidly to influence Spotify's decision.\n   - **Possible Future Developments:** While new severe allegations have emerged, unless there are substantial changes\u2014such as a conviction or overwhelming public pressure\u2014it is unlikely Spotify will change its current stance within this time frame.\n\n6. **Uncertainty and Potential for Change:**\n   - **Unpredictable Events:** Unexpected developments could occur, such as new evidence, shifts in public opinion, or changes in Spotify's policies, which might increase the likelihood of removal.\n   - **Legal Obligations:** Currently, there are no legal obligations compelling Spotify to remove Diddy's music. However, new legal circumstances could alter this.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the above factors, while it is not impossible that Spotify will remove Diddy's songs from his Spotify page before January 1, 2025, it appears unlikely given current information and historical precedent. The combination of limited time, lack of a legal conviction, and Spotify's past actions in similar situations suggest a low probability.\n\n**Probability: 15%**", "probability": 15}
