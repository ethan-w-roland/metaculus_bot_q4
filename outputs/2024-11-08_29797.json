    "comment": "**(a) Time left until outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately 53 days left until January 1, 2025. This is about 1 month and 23 days.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changes, IBM's starting price for Pay-as-you-go quantum computing services remains at $96 USD per minute. According to the resolution criteria, since the price is less than or equal to $96 USD per minute, the question would resolve as **No**.\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only about 13 days left (a quarter of 53 days), the probability of IBM raising its Pay-as-you-go quantum computing prices before January 1, 2025 would be lower due to the limited time for announcement and implementation. I would estimate the probability at around **5%**.\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith approximately 212 days left (4 times 53 days), there is significantly more time for IBM to potentially announce and implement a price increase. Given the extended time frame, I would estimate the probability at around **30%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nIBM's Pay-as-you-go quantum computing service currently starts at $96 USD per minute. As of today, November 8, 2024, there have been no announcements or indications that IBM plans to raise this price before January 1, 2025.\n\n**Factors Considered:**\n\n1. **Lack of Announced Price Changes:**\n   - There are no specific announcements from IBM regarding price increases for their Pay-as-you-go quantum computing services effective before January 1, 2025.\n   - Price changes for major services are typically announced in advance to provide customers with notice.\n\n2. **IBM's Price Harmonization:**\n   - IBM has announced a global price harmonization effective January 1, 2025, which includes increases for various services.\n   - However, quantum computing services are not explicitly mentioned in this harmonization plan.\n\n3. **Increased Demand and Operational Costs:**\n   - IBM is expanding its quantum computing infrastructure, including new data centers and advanced quantum systems.\n   - Increased operational costs and growing demand could justify a price increase.\n\n4. **Economic Factors:**\n   - Inflation and uncertain economic conditions have prompted IBM to adjust prices for other services.\n   - It's possible these factors could influence pricing for quantum computing services.\n\n5. **Time Remaining:**\n   - With only 53 days left until January 1, 2025, the window for announcing and implementing a price increase is narrowing.\n   - Significant price changes usually come with customer communication and a lead time.\n\n6. **Industry Trends:**\n   - There is no clear industry trend of quantum computing service providers raising prices recently.\n   - Competitors have not announced similar price increases, reducing the pressure on IBM to adjust prices competitively.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile there are factors that could lead IBM to raise its Pay-as-you-go quantum computing prices (such as increased demand and operational costs), the lack of any announced price changes and the limited time frame make it less likely. Therefore, considering all available information, I estimate a **10%** probability that IBM will raise its Pay-as-you-go quantum computing prices before January 1, 2025.\n\n**Probability: 10%**",
