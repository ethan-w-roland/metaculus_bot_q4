    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Bashar al-Assad be President of Syria on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Bashar al-Assad is President of Syria on December 31, 2024. \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAP: [What to know about sudden rebel gains in Syria’s 13-year war and why it matters](https://apnews.com/article/syria-hts-assad-aleppo-fighting-2be43ee530b7932b123a0f26b158ac22)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Bashar al-Assad remaining the President of Syria until December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Political and Military Situation\n- Despite recent challenges, including the loss of control in Aleppo to rebel forces, Assad's grip on power is still supported by key allies such as Russia and Iran. Russia, in particular, has strong incentives to maintain Assad in power due to its military bases in Syria, including the naval base at Tartus and the air force base at Hmeimim[4][5].\n\n## Military and Allied Support\n- Assad can count on support from Shiite militants and continued assistance from Russia, which has been a crucial factor in his ability to maintain power during the civil war[4][5].\n\n## Internal and External Pressures\n- The Syrian civil war has seen a recent resurgence, with rebel groups like Ha’yat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) gaining control of Aleppo and advancing towards other cities. However, analysts suggest that while Assad is under pressure, his immediate removal from power is not imminent unless the insurgency spreads to critical areas like Daraa in southern Syria[4][5].\n\n## Historical Context and Elections\n- Assad has maintained his position through a series of elections and referendums, which, although widely criticized as sham processes, have consistently reaffirmed his leadership. The Syrian constitution, as amended, allows him to remain in power until 2028[2][3].\n\n## Market Predictions\n- Predictive markets, such as those on Manifold Markets, indicate a high probability (around 92%) of Assad remaining in power until the end of 2024[1].\n\nGiven these points, while there are significant challenges to Assad's rule, the current evidence suggests that he is likely to remain in power until the end of 2024, supported by his allies and the existing power structure.\n\n### Answer Clarity\nThe answer to whether Bashar al-Assad will be President of Syria on December 31, 2024, is not definitively clear but leans towards a positive likelihood based on the current situation and historical trends. However, the fluid nature of the Syrian conflict means that unforeseen events could alter this outcome.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Bashar al-Assad currently the President of Syria?\nANSWER: YES\n\nBashar al-Assad has been the President of Syria since 2000 and continues to hold the position. This is confirmed by multiple sources, including Britannica, Wikipedia, and other recent references[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have rebel groups, including Ha’yat Tahrir al-Sham, maintained or expanded their control in Aleppo as of December 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe provided source does not specify the current status of rebel groups, including Ha’yat Tahrir al-Sham, in Aleppo as of December 2024. It discusses the broader context of Syria's conflict but does not provide the specific information needed to answer the question about control in Aleppo.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Bashar al-Assad have the support of Iran as of December 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of December 2024, Bashar al-Assad has the support of Iran. Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, met with Assad in Damascus to express Tehran's continued support for the Syrian government in the fight against rebels and terrorism[1][2]. Iran has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Assad and the Syrian government, both politically and militarily.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do predictive markets still indicate a high probability of Bashar al-Assad remaining in power until the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, predictive markets still indicate a high probability of Bashar al-Assad remaining in power until the end of 2024.\n\n- A market on Manifold Markets shows a 75% chance that Bashar al-Assad will be in power in Syria until the end of 2024[1].\n- A market on Polymarket indicates a high likelihood that Assad will remain the President of Syria through December 31, 2024[3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any successful attempts to remove Bashar al-Assad from power since December 2023?\nANSWER: No, there have been no successful attempts to remove Bashar al-Assad from power since December 2023. Despite significant rebel advances, including the capture of Aleppo and other areas, the Syrian government, backed by Russian and Iranian support, has managed to maintain control and even launch counterattacks to repel rebel advances near key cities like Hama[1][3][5].\n\nAs of the latest reports, Assad's regime is still in power, and while the rebels have made significant gains, they have not succeeded in removing him from power.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Bashar al-Assad have the support of Russia as of December 2024?\nANSWER: As of December 2024, Bashar al-Assad still has the support of Russia, although the extent and effectiveness of this support have been significantly impacted by Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\n- Russia continues to conduct airstrikes in support of Assad's forces and has maintained its military presence in Syria, including the use of its air base in Hmeimim and naval base in Tartus[1][3][4].\n- Despite being preoccupied with the war in Ukraine, Russia has not abandoned Assad and continues to provide some level of military support, including air raids and other operations[1][3][4].\n- However, Russia's ability to increase its support significantly is limited due to its commitments in Ukraine[1][2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Shiite militias continued to support Bashar al-Assad through December 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nShiite militias, particularly those backed by Iran, have continued to support Bashar al-Assad in Syria through December 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- Iranian-backed Iraqi militias, including Kataib Hezbollah, Badr Organization, and Harakat Hezbollah al Nujaba, have reportedly deployed to northern Syria to help defend the Assad regime against Syrian opposition forces[1][3][5].\n- These militias have been involved in defensive operations and have engaged with opposition forces in various regions of Syria[1][2][3].\n- Despite some limitations and challenges, such as Hezbollah's current inability to commit large-scale forces due to recent losses in Lebanon, Iranian-backed militias continue to provide support to the Assad regime[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any significant insurgency movement towards critical areas like Daraa in Syria by December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there has been significant insurgency movement towards critical areas like Daraa in Syria by December 2024.\n\nBeginning on November 29, 2024, southern Syrian opposition groups launched assaults on Daraa Governorate and As-Suwayda Governorate, targeting government military installations, checkpoints, and security apparatus positions. This offensive was part of a coordinated effort with the Northwestern Syria offensive, aiming to implement a pincer movement towards Damascus[1][2].\n\nThe insurgency in Daraa involved various activities, including attacks on the State Security Center in Inkhil, rocket attacks on the Air Force Intelligence facility in Suwayda, and the killing of Syrian Armed Forces personnel and other combatants in the region. Additionally, public demonstrations in support of the rebel forces were reported in several cities within Daraa Governorate[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Russian military bases in Syria, such as Tartus and Hmeimim, still operational as of December 2024?\nANSWER: As of December 2024, the status of Russian military bases in Syria is as follows:\n\n- The Russian naval base at Tartus is under significant pressure and has seen the evacuation of its naval assets. Satellite images and reports indicate that Russian naval vessels, including frigates, a submarine, and auxiliaries, have departed Tartus due to the worsening situation in Syria[1][2].\n  \n- The Hmeimim Air Base, however, is still operational. There are no reports indicating that Hmeimim has been abandoned or is non-operational. In fact, Syrian government forces backed by Russian air strikes have been actively engaging rebel forces in the area, suggesting continued Russian air support from this base[4][5].\n\nTherefore, while Tartus is facing significant challenges and has seen the evacuation of its naval assets, Hmeimim Air Base remains operational.\n\n**YES**, but with the caveat that Tartus is under threat and its naval assets have been evacuated.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Syrian elections reaffirmed Bashar al-Assad’s leadership without significant opposition as of December 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe sources indicate that Syrian elections have consistently reaffirmed Bashar al-Assad’s leadership without significant opposition. Here are the key points:\n\n- In the 2021 presidential election, Assad secured another term with more than 95% of the vote, despite low voter turnout[2].\n- The 2024 parliamentary elections, held on July 15, were characterized by the dominance of the Ba'ath Party and its allies, with the electoral system heavily favoring them. The Ba'ath Party and its allies secured the majority of the seats, and the process was widely criticized for its lack of credibility and opposition participation[2][3][4].\n- The elections were limited to areas under regime control, and Syrians living abroad, including many opposition members, were unable to participate without significant barriers[2][3].\n- The opposition's campaigns against the legitimacy of the elections did not gain significant traction[3].\n\nThese points collectively indicate that the Syrian elections have reaffirmed Assad’s leadership without substantial opposition.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n26 days (from December 5, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf the current situation remains unchanged, Bashar al-Assad would continue to be the President of Syria on December 31, 2024.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith approximately 6-7 days remaining, the forecast would likely remain similar to the current assessment, maintaining a high probability (around 75-80%) that Assad remains in power.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nWith an extended timeframe of about 104 days, increased uncertainties and potential shifts in the conflict dynamics could introduce more variability. The probability might slightly decrease to around 70-75% due to the extended period allowing for unforeseen developments.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nBashar al-Assad's position as President of Syria remains relatively secure in the short term due to several key factors:\n\n1. **Allied Support:** Assad continues to receive crucial backing from Russia and Iran. Despite Russia's strained resources due to its involvement in Ukraine, Russia maintains operational support through the Hmeimim Air Base. Iran's support, including Shiite militias, remains steadfast, bolstering Assad's military capabilities.\n\n2. **Military Presence:** Although the Russian naval base at Tartus has seen some evacuation, the operational status of the Hmeimim Air Base ensures ongoing Russian military support. Additionally, Iranian-backed militias are actively engaged in defensive operations against rebel advances.\n\n3. **Rebel Advances:** While rebel groups, including HTS, have made significant gains in areas like Aleppo and are pushing towards critical regions like Daraa, these advances have not yet reached a threshold that would compel Assad's immediate removal. The Syrian government's counteroffensives have so far contained these insurgent movements.\n\n4. **Electoral Legitimacy:** Despite international criticism regarding the legitimacy of Syrian elections, Assad's regime has consistently secured victories through controlled electoral processes, reinforcing his claim to the presidency.\n\n5. **Predictive Markets:** Current predictions from markets like Manifold Markets suggest a high probability (around 75%) of Assad remaining in power until the end of 2024. Given the short timeframe, these market assessments align with the prevailing stability of his regime.\n\n6. **Short Timeframe:** With only 26 days remaining, there is limited opportunity for significant changes to alter the current balance of power. The entrenched support systems and ongoing military engagements suggest that Assad can maintain his position in the near term.\n\nConsidering these factors, while there are challenges to Assad's rule, particularly from rebel advances, the existing support structure and limited time until the resolution date bolster the likelihood of him remaining in power.\n\n**Probability: 80%**",
