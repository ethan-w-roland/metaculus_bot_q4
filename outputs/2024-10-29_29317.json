    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nIn the 2024 US elections, will Democrats win both the White House and the House of Representatives?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Democratic Party wins control of the House of Representives and if the individual who wins the presidential election is the nominee of the Democratic Party in the 2024 US elections.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections. In case of any confusion or ambiguity about which party wins the House, the deciding factor will be which party has a majority of the votes required to elect the Speaker of the House.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe 2024 US elections will be held on November 5, 2024. See Wikipedia: [2024 United States elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_elections)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the Democrats winning both the White House and the House of Representatives in the 2024 US elections, here are some key points and background information that can help inform the prediction:\n\n## Current Political Landscape\n- As of October 2024, Republicans hold a 220-212 majority in the U.S. House with three vacancies. For Democrats to gain control of the House, they need to win a net of at least five districts.\n\n## Competitiveness of House Races\n- The 2024 House elections are expected to be highly competitive, with forecasts suggesting a tight margin between the two parties. Approximately 54 districts (13.1% of the total) are considered battleground races, with Democrats holding 29 and Republicans holding 25 of these districts.\n- Various forecasters and ratings, such as the Cook Political Report, Sabato's Crystal Ball, and others, provide ongoing updates on the competitiveness of individual districts. These ratings often categorize districts as Solid, Likely, Lean, or Toss-up, which can help gauge the likelihood of party control.\n\n## Historical Context\n- No party has lost control of the House after a single congressional term since 1954. This historical trend might influence the outcome, although current political dynamics and specific district-level factors will also play significant roles.\n\n## Approval Ratings and Congressional Productivity\n- The 118th Congress has been marked by low productivity and a 13% approval rating, which could impact voter sentiment. However, the direct impact of these factors on the election outcome is uncertain and depends on various other variables.\n\n## Leadership and Candidate Factors\n- The Democratic Party is led by Hakeem Jeffries, the first African American to lead either party in Congress, while the Republican Party is led by Mike Johnson following the removal of Kevin McCarthy. Leadership changes and candidate profiles can influence voter decisions but are just one of many factors.\n\nGiven these points, while there are indicators of a highly competitive election environment, it is not possible to definitively answer whether the Democrats will win both the White House and the House of Representatives based solely on the available information. The outcome will depend on a multitude of factors including campaign performance, voter turnout, economic conditions, and other external influences. Therefore, the answer to this question is not immediately clear and would require ongoing analysis and updates closer to the election date.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Democratic Party's presidential nominee leading in aggregate national polls as of October 2024?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not include information about the current aggregate national polls for the 2024 presidential election as of October 2024. They detail the process of how Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee but do not provide polling data or comparisons with other candidates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the incumbent president's approval rating been above 50% in recent months?\nANSWER: No, the incumbent president's approval rating has not been above 50% in recent months. According to the sources:\n\n- Joe Biden's average approval rating in his 13th quarter in office was 38.7%, which is the lowest for any president in recent history at that point in their term.\n- Recent polls show Biden's approval ratings ranging from 34% to 41%, all of which are below 50%.\n- There is no indication in the provided sources that Biden's approval rating has risen above 50% in recent months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are key swing states showing a lead for the Democratic presidential nominee?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the lead in the key swing states is not consistently in favor of the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris.\n\n- In some swing states, Harris is leading, such as Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin.\n- However, in other swing states, Donald Trump is leading, such as Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.\n\nGiven the close margins and the margin of error in the polls, the race in these swing states is essentially a dead heat, making it unclear if any single candidate has a definitive lead across all key swing states.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been significant scandals or controversies affecting the Republican Party or their presidential nominee?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThere have been significant scandals and controversies affecting the Republican Party and its presidential nominee, particularly in the context of the 2024 election.\n\n1. **Mark Robinson Scandal**: The Republican gubernatorial candidate in North Carolina, Mark Robinson, has been embroiled in a scandal involving inflammatory and vulgar comments he made on a pornography website's message board, including anti-Semitic, racist, and other derogatory remarks. This scandal has complicated Donald Trump's campaign in the state, as Trump had endorsed Robinson and featured him at rallies.\n\n2. **Trump's Association with Robinson**: Trump's close association with Robinson has led to criticism and attempts by the Kamala Harris campaign to tie Trump to Robinson's controversial statements, highlighting issues of morality and suitability for office.\n\n3. **Other Controversies**: Trump's campaign has also faced other controversies, such as spreading false claims about immigrants in Ohio and doubling down on conspiracy theories. Additionally, there have been remarks by other campaign figures that have sparked controversy, such as Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders' comments about Kamala Harris.\n\nThese scandals and controversies have significant implications for the Republican Party and Trump's presidential campaign, particularly in crucial swing states like North Carolina.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout among Democratic-leaning demographics projected to be high in the 2024 elections?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the projection for voter turnout among Democratic-leaning demographics in the 2024 elections is somewhat nuanced but can be summarized as follows:\n\n- The sources indicate that higher turnout environments tend to favor Democratic-leaning demographics, particularly younger and nonwhite voters, who are more likely to lean Democratic.\n- It is noted that in higher turnout scenarios, the marginal voter, who is more likely to be younger and nonwhite, leans Democratic by a significant margin.\n- However, the overall turnout rate is expected to be slightly lower in 2024 compared to 2020, which could impact the absolute numbers of Democratic-leaning voters turning out.\n\nGiven these points, while the turnout among Democratic-leaning demographics may not be as high in absolute numbers due to the expected slight decline in overall turnout, these groups are still projected to turn out and lean Democratic in higher turnout scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there major third-party candidates drawing support away from the Republican presidential nominee?\nANSWER: Yes, there are major third-party candidates who are drawing support away from the Republican presidential nominee in the 2024 United States presidential election.\n\n- Cornel West, running as an independent under the Justice for All Party, is supported by Republican operatives in an effort to siphon votes away from the Democratic nominee, but this strategy could also impact the Republican nominee by altering the voter landscape. West's campaign has received significant support from Republican-aligned groups and individuals, which could potentially draw some liberal or disaffected voters who might otherwise vote for the Republican candidate.\n\n- Other third-party candidates, such as Jill Stein of the Green Party and Randall Terry of the Constitution Party, are also mentioned as potentially drawing votes away from both major party candidates, including the Republican nominee. These candidates often attract voters who are dissatisfied with the major party platforms on specific issues, such as abortion, environmental matters, or foreign policy.\n\nThese dynamics suggest that third-party candidates are indeed playing a role in potentially drawing support away from the Republican nominee, among other effects on the election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives out-fundraising their Republican opponents on average?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer is yes, Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives are out-fundraising their Republican opponents on average in many of the competitive districts.\n\n- According to Politico, Democratic challengers in 17 of the 29 GOP-held districts outraised their incumbent Republican opponents, with an average of $1.2 million for Democrats compared to $965,000 for Republicans.\n- Axios reports that in the first quarter of 2024, the average fundraising haul for Democratic incumbents and challengers in highly competitive House districts was approximately $970,000, while Republican incumbents and candidates raised an average of just over $610,000.\n- CBS News also mentions that Democratic candidates in competitive districts raised an average of $1 million in the recent quarter, holding an average fundraising advantage of about $400,000 over their Republican opponents.\n\nThese sources consistently indicate that Democratic candidates are outperforming their Republican counterparts in fundraising in many key districts. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent special elections and primaries shown a trend favoring Democratic candidates?\nANSWER: YES\n\nRecent special elections and primaries have indeed shown a trend favoring Democratic candidates. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- In the Ohio 6th district special election, Democratic candidate Michael Kripchak overperformed by about 20 points in a district that Trump won by 29 points, indicating a significant swing towards Democrats.\n- Democrats have won several special elections in various states, including Michigan, Alabama, New Hampshire, New York, and Pennsylvania, often by focusing on issues like reproductive rights and contrasting themselves with Republican opponents.\n- Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Democrats have consistently outperformed their 2020 presidential baseline in special House elections, averaging a 4-point overperformance and sometimes as high as 18 points above their partisan baseline.\n- An analysis from FiveThirtyEight found that in 38 special elections held in 2023, Democrats outperformed the partisan lean of the areas by an average of 10%.\n\nThese trends suggest that Democratic candidates have been performing better than expected in recent special elections and primaries.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do current forecasts predict that Democrats are likely to win control of the House of Representatives in the 2024 elections?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the forecasts do not definitively predict that Democrats are likely to win control of the House of Representatives in the 2024 elections. Here are the key points:\n\n- The current partisan breakdown shows Republicans holding a 220-212 majority, and Democrats need to gain a net of five districts to win a majority.\n- Forecasts suggest the election is expected to be highly competitive, with less than a 5-seat difference between the two parties, indicating a tight race rather than a clear prediction of Democratic control.\n- Analysts have identified several competitive races, but the outcome is uncertain and depends on various factors.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the U.S. economy experiencing strong growth and low unemployment as of October 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nAs of October 2024, the U.S. economy is exhibiting strong growth and low unemployment based on the following points from the sources:\n\n- The U.S. economy has seen upward revisions to GDP growth, with the real GDP average annual growth rate revised up to 2.3% for 2024.\n- The second quarter of 2024 saw a 3% annualized GDP growth rate, and consumer spending and private inventory investment were significant contributors to this growth.\n- Job growth has been robust, with the economy adding 254,000 payroll jobs in September and total job gains of 1.8 million in the first nine months of 2024, which is in line with pre-pandemic averages.\n- The unemployment rate has ticked down to 4.1%, and layoffs remain low. Average hourly wage growth has also risen by 4% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nThese indicators collectively suggest that the U.S. economy is experiencing strong growth and low unemployment as of October 2024.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are **7 days** remaining until the 2024 U.S. elections on November 5, 2024.\n\n---\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends and conditions persist without any significant changes, the **Democratic Party is slightly favored to win both the White House and the House of Representatives**. Several factors contribute to this assessment:\n\n- **Presidential Race:** The race is tightly contested, but the Democrats have certain advantages, such as strong economic performance under the current administration, scandals affecting the Republican nominee and party, and higher projected voter turnout among Democratic-leaning demographics.\n  \n- **House of Representatives:** Democrats are out-fundraising Republicans in key districts, have overperformed in recent special elections, and are benefiting from favorable trends in voter sentiment.\n\n---\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only about **1-2 days left** until the election, with such limited time for any major shifts, I would forecast a **slightly higher probability** of the Democrats winning both—the probability might increase to around **60%**. The reduced time frame minimizes the chance of late-breaking events altering the current dynamics.\n\n---\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were **28 days** remaining until the election, the extended time frame increases the potential for unforeseen events (e.g., economic shifts, international incidents, major campaign developments). Given this added uncertainty, I would adjust the forecast to a **slightly lower probability**, around **50%**, reflecting a more cautious outlook due to the increased time for variables to impact the election outcomes.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs a superforecaster analyzing the probability of the Democrats winning both the White House and the House of Representatives in the upcoming election, several key factors inform my estimation:\n\n1. **Presidential Election Dynamics:**\n   - **Economic Conditions:** The U.S. economy is experiencing strong growth and low unemployment, which traditionally benefits the incumbent party. This positive economic backdrop may bolster support for the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris.\n   - **Scandals Affecting Republicans:** Significant controversies, such as the Mark Robinson scandal in North Carolina, have the potential to negatively impact the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, especially in swing states.\n   - **Voter Turnout Projections:** Higher turnout among Democratic-leaning demographics, particularly younger and nonwhite voters, is anticipated. This could provide the Democrats with a crucial advantage in a close race.\n   - **Third-Party Candidates:** The presence of third-party candidates appears to be siphoning some support away from the Republican nominee, which may marginally benefit the Democratic campaign.\n   - **Swing States:** The race in key swing states is very close, with neither candidate having a definitive lead. This underscores the competitiveness of the election but also highlights opportunities for Democratic gains.\n\n2. **House of Representatives Outlook:**\n   - **Fundraising Advantages:** Democratic candidates are out-fundraising their Republican opponents in many competitive districts, signaling strong campaign resources and potential voter outreach advantages.\n   - **Performance in Special Elections:** Democrats have overperformed in recent special elections and primaries, suggesting favorable momentum and voter enthusiasm.\n   - **Competitive Districts:** While historical trends favor the incumbent party retaining control of the House, the unusually high number of competitive districts and the tight margins reduce the predictability based on historical patterns alone.\n   - **Approval Ratings and Public Sentiment:** Low congressional approval ratings and dissatisfaction with legislative productivity could motivate voters to favor change, potentially benefiting Democratic candidates.\n\n3. **Correlated Outcomes:**\n   - The outcomes of the presidential race and the House elections are **positively correlated**. A strong performance by the Democratic presidential candidate could have down-ballot effects, helping Democratic candidates in House races.\n\n4. **Time Frame Considerations:**\n   - With only a week left until the election, significant shifts in voter sentiment are less likely, but not impossible. However, the current trends and data suggest a slight edge for the Democrats.\n   - Extending or reducing the time frame affects the level of uncertainty. Less time reduces the likelihood of major changes, increasing confidence in the current forecast, while more time allows for potential new developments that could sway the outcomes.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 55%**",
