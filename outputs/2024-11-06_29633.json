    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill OpenAI's o1 remain the top LLM in all categories of Chatbot Arena on November 30, 2024?\n\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-06\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis questions resolves as **Yes** if a single o1 model has the same or higher rank than all non-o1 models in all of the following 9 categories on [Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/), on November 30, 2024:\n\n- Overall\n- Overall w/ Style Control\n- Hard Prompts (Overall)\n- Hard Prompts (Overall) w/ Style Control\n- Instruction Following\n- Coding\n- Math\n- Multi-turn\n- Longer Query\n\nIf all o1 models have at least one category in which they are worse than a non-o1 model, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- For the purposes of this question, a model having no rank in a category means it is worse than all models that have a rank.\n- Other models also being ranked 1 do not affect resolution, as long as a single o1 model is also ranked 1.\n- An OpenAI model counts as an o1 model if it contains \"o1\" in its name on Chatbot Arena.\n- Any categories that are no longer available on Chatbot Arena will not affect resolution, as long as they are fewer than 4. If at least 4 of the aforementioned 9 categories are not available, this question will be **annulled**.\n- Any categories that are renamed but have the same methodology will be considered equivalent for purposes of this question. \n- As of October 4, 2024, the relevant ranks are presented in both the Overview tab and in the Arena tab, by selecting the relevant category and potentially applying the required filter.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/) (previously hosted on <https://lmsys.org/>) is a [benchmarking platform](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/) for large language models (LLMs). It uses an [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) similar to the one used in chess to rank LLMs by their capabilities. Rankings are based on user ratings of different LLM systems. Besides general rankings, Chatbot Arena has added various more narrow categories, such as Hard Prompts, Instruction Following, or Math.\n\nIn September 12, 2024, OpenAI [announced](https://openai.com/o1/) o1, a series of models [trained](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/) to use chain of thought to solve complex problems. According to OpenAI, o1 models perform significantly better in math and coding competitions, among other domains. As of October 4, 2024, o1-preview is ranked #1 in all Chatbot Arena categories.\n\nFor further context please see: \n\n- [Chatbot Arena: New models & Elo system update](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-12-07-leaderboard/)\n- [Does style matter? Disentangling style and substance in Chatbot Arena](https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-08-28-style-control/)\n- [Introducing Hard Prompts Category in Chatbot Arena](https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-05-17-category-hard/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of OpenAI's o1 model remaining the top LLM in all categories of Chatbot Arena on November 30, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Rankings and Stability\nAs of recent updates, the top models on Chatbot Arena are GPT-4o with 1316 ELO, Gemini with 1300 ELO, and Grok with 1294 ELO. The o1-preview model has shown promising performance, sitting at 1339 ELO, but this can change as more votes are cast.\n\n## ELO Score Dynamics\nELO scores on Chatbot Arena are relatively stable over time but can fluctuate based on ongoing user evaluations. The scores reflect human ratings, which can introduce biases, such as preferences for certain model behaviors or name recognition, although the platform attempts to mitigate these biases through mechanisms like Style Control.\n\n## Model Updates and Releases\nThe o1 model's performance can be influenced by updates and new releases from other competitors. For example, Google and other AI labs are continuously improving their models, and new models like Gemini 1.5 and potential future releases could challenge o1's position.\n\n## Categories and Comprehensive Performance\nFor o1 to remain the top LLM in all categories, it must perform exceptionally well across various tasks and categories on Chatbot Arena. This includes not just general conversation but also specialized tasks such as coding, fact-checking, and advanced reasoning.\n\n## Community and Market Predictions\nPredictions from the community and market participants indicate a mix of opinions. Some believe OpenAI's strong brand and continuous improvements will keep o1 at the top, while others speculate that competitors, especially Google and Meta, could surpass OpenAI by the end of 2024 due to their significant computing capabilities.\n\n## Resolution Criteria\nThe question of whether o1 will remain the top LLM in all categories would be resolved based on its ELO ratings across all relevant categories on Chatbot Arena as of November 30, 2024. If o1 maintains the highest or tied-for-highest ELO score in all categories, it would be considered the top LLM.\n\nGiven these points, while the o1 model has shown strong initial performance, the dynamic nature of model updates, user evaluations, and the competitive landscape in AI development make it uncertain whether o1 will retain its top position in all categories by November 30, 2024. Therefore, the answer to this question is not immediately clear and would depend on ongoing developments and evaluations.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do historical trends show that top-ranked models on Chatbot Arena retain their positions over several weeks?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether top-ranked models on Chatbot Arena consistently retain their positions over several weeks.\n\n- The sources provide snapshots of the leaderboard at specific times, such as the rankings between April 24 and May 22, 2023, and mentions of updates and changes in the rankings.\n- However, there is no comprehensive historical trend analysis provided in these sources that shows whether the top-ranked models maintain their positions over an extended period.\n- The dynamic nature of the leaderboard, with periodic updates and the addition of new models, suggests that rankings can change, but the sources do not offer a detailed longitudinal analysis to confirm this.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Chatbot Arena expected to maintain the same categories and ranking methodology through November 30, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit statement indicating that the categories and ranking methodology of Chatbot Arena will remain unchanged through November 30, 2024.

However, OpenAI's o1 \"Strawberry\" model still retains an edge in reasoning tasks.\n- The report also predicts that an open-source alternative to OpenAIâ€™s o1 will surpass it across a range of benchmarks, but it does not specify a timeline for this surpassing to occur.\n\nGiven this information, while competitors have made significant progress and there are predictions of future surpassing, it is unclear if these models will be fully released and surpass o1 before November 30, 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant advancements in AI research that could lead to new models outperforming o1 before November 30, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been significant advancements in AI research that could lead to new models outperforming previous ones before November 30, 2024.\n\n- Meta's Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team has made several breakthroughs, including the development of new AI models like Llama and Llama 2, which are free for research and commercial use. They have also advanced in areas such as object detection, unsupervised machine translation, and multimodal models like Ego-Exo4D, which combine egocentric and exocentric views.\n\n- The use of generative AI has seen substantial growth, with many organizations reporting significant benefits and increased adoption. New foundation models with open licenses, such as those from Meta, StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and others, have achieved performance parity with or even outperformed leading proprietary models through fine-tuning techniques and community-developed datasets.\n\n- The U.S. administration has also advanced various AI initiatives, including the development of frameworks for managing generative AI risks and securely developing generative AI systems. These efforts include investments in AI research, testbeds, and model evaluation tools, all of which contribute to the advancement and improvement of AI models.\n\nThese advancements indicate a continuous and significant improvement in AI research and capabilities.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been significant fluctuation in Chatbot Arena rankings for top models in recent months?\nANSWER: There have been some fluctuations and considerations in the Chatbot Arena rankings for top models in recent months, although the extent of these fluctuations can be nuanced.\n\n1. **User Preference and Model Updates**: The rankings can change based on user preferences and updates to the models. For example, the GPT-4 API was updated from version 0314 to 0613, and there was a noticeable difference in user preference between these versions.\n\n2. **Methodological Adjustments**: The Chatbot Arena has made methodological adjustments, such as adopting a bootstrap-like technique to stabilize ratings and incorporating new models quickly. These changes can affect the stability and ranking of models.\n\n3. **New Models and Voting Patterns**: The introduction of new models and changes in voting patterns can also influence the rankings. For instance, the addition of new models like Tulu-2-DPO-70B and Yi-34B-Chat, and shifts in user distribution or voting behaviors, can impact the rankings.\n\n4. **Consistency and Stability**: Despite these factors, the platform has implemented measures to ensure consistent and stable scores, such as using the Elo rating system and refining methods to filter out low-quality prompts.\n\nIn summary, while there are fluctuations due to various factors, the platform is continually refined to maintain stability and accuracy in the rankings.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there indications of user biases on Chatbot Arena that could affect o1's rankings negatively?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several indications of user biases on Chatbot Arena that could affect the rankings negatively:\n\n## User Preferences and Biases\n- Users may have different preferences for the style and substance of model responses. For example, some users might prefer longer, markdown-styled answers, while others may prefer more succinct responses. This variability can lead to inconsistent voting and affects the reliability of the rankings.\n\n## Limited and Self-Selecting User Base\n- The user base of Chatbot Arena is self-selecting, meaning users are already interested in testing models. This can result in a lack of diversity in the types of questions asked and the way models are evaluated, potentially not pushing models to their limits.\n\n## Lack of Transparency and Reproducibility\n- The evaluation process is not fully transparent, and the results are not reproducible. Users may rank the same pair of outputs differently on different days, and the subjective nature of the evaluations can introduce significant variability.\n\n## Dataset and Question Diversity\n- Most queries on the platform are in English, which makes it difficult to estimate the performance of non-English languages. Additionally, the queries are mostly one-round and simple, which may not fully capture the capabilities of the models.\n\n## Absolute vs. Relative Evaluation\n- The platform uses relative evaluation (comparing two models side-by-side) rather than absolute evaluation, which can make it harder to define what \"better\" means. This relative evaluation can lead to biases in how users perceive and vote for model responses.\n\nThese factors suggest that user biases and the subjective nature of the evaluations on Chatbot Arena could indeed affect the rankings negatively.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 24 days.\n\n(b) **If nothing changed, the outcome would be:** **Yes**.\n\n(c) **If there was only a quarter of the time left:** I would forecast a probability of **90%**.\n\n(d) **If there was 4x the time left:** I would forecast a probability of **70%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of **November 6, 2024**, there are **24 days** remaining until **November 30, 2024**, when the outcome will be determined.\n\nCurrently, OpenAI's **o1 model** is ranked **#1 in all nine categories** on Chatbot Arena. If the situation remains unchanged, the question would resolve as **Yes**.\n\n**Time Frame Considerations:**\n\n- **Short-Term Stability:** With only 24 days left, it is less likely for significant changes to occur that would dethrone o1 from the top positions in all categories. Changes in the rankings typically require time for new models to be introduced, evaluated, and accumulate enough user interactions to impact the Elo ratings significantly.\n\n- **Competitor Releases:** While competitors like Google, Meta, and Anthropic are continuously working on new models (e.g., **Gemini 1.5**, **Llama 3.1**, **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**), it is uncertain whether these models will be released and surpass o1 within the next 24 days. The release and adoption cycle usually takes longer.\n\n- **Historical Trends:** Top-ranked models on Chatbot Arena tend to maintain their positions over short periods unless a major breakthrough occurs. In the past, significant shifts in rankings have occurred over months rather than weeks.\n\n**User Biases and Evaluation Methods:**\n\n- **User Biases:** There are user biases on Chatbot Arena that can affect rankings due to preferences in style, familiarity with models, and other subjective factors. However, these biases are unlikely to cause drastic changes in a short period.\n\n- **Evaluation Stability:** Chatbot Arena uses the Elo rating system, which is relatively stable, and recent methodological improvements help maintain consistent rankings.\n\n**Alternate Time Scenarios:**\n\n- **Quarter of the Time Left (6 days):** With only 6 days remaining, the probability of o1 remaining at the top increases to around **90%**. There would be minimal time for any new developments or significant ranking changes.\n\n- **Four Times the Time Left (96 days):** Extending the time frame to 96 days introduces more uncertainty. Competitors are more likely to release new models, and there's ample time for rankings to fluctuate based on user evaluations. Therefore, the probability decreases to around **70%**.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nConsidering the current standings, the short time frame until the outcome is known, and the factors discussed above, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability that OpenAI's o1 model will remain the top LLM in all categories on Chatbot Arena by November 30, 2024. While there is always some uncertainty due to potential unforeseen developments, the likelihood of significant changes occurring within the next 24 days is relatively low.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
