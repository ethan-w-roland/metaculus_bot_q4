    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill South Dakota voters approve Initiated Measure 29, which would legalize recreational marijuana in the state?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-31\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Dakota Initiated Measure 29 is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reporting. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [South Dakota Initiated Measure 29, Marijuana Legalization Initiative (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/South_Dakota_Initiated_Measure_29,_Marijuana_Legalization_Initiative_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of South Dakota voters approving Initiated Measure 29, which aims to legalize recreational marijuana, here are some key points and historical context that could inform the prediction:\n\n## Historical Context\n- This is the third time South Dakota voters are considering the legalization of recreational marijuana. In 2020, Constitutional Amendment A, which legalized recreational marijuana, was approved by voters but was later struck down by the courts due to a single-subject rule violation.\n- In 2022, Initiated Measure 27, another attempt to legalize recreational marijuana, was rejected by voters with a 47.08%-52.92% vote.\n\n## Current Measure Details\n- Initiated Measure 29 would legalize the recreational use, possession, and distribution of marijuana for individuals 21 and older, with specific limits on possession and cultivation. It also includes restrictions on use in public places, schools, and other specified areas.\n\n## Public and Organizational Stances\n- There is significant opposition from groups such as the Catholic dioceses of South Dakota and the advocacy organization \"Protecting South Dakota Kids,\" which argue that marijuana legalization could lead to various public health and social issues.\n- The South Dakota Republican Party has also adopted a resolution to oppose the measure.\n\n## Previous Outcomes and Trends\n- The previous rejection of Initiated Measure 27 in 2022 suggests that there may be ongoing resistance to recreational marijuana legalization in South Dakota.\n- However, proponents argue that trends in other states that have legalized recreational marijuana show potential benefits such as reduced teen cannabis use, improved police resource allocation, and other societal benefits.\n\n## Base Rates\n- As of now, 24 states have legalized recreational marijuana, and 38 states have medical marijuana markets. This broader national context might influence voter attitudes, but local sentiments and previous voting patterns are crucial.\n\n## Time to Resolution\n- The vote on Initiated Measure 29 is scheduled for November 5, 2024, providing a clear timeline for resolution.\n\nGiven these points, while it is not possible to predict the outcome with certainty, the historical context of previous rejections and ongoing opposition suggests that the approval of Initiated Measure 29 is not guaranteed. However, the broader national trends and the arguments presented by both sides will likely influence the final decision. The superforecaster should consider these factors, including the base rates of previous votes, the current state of public opinion, and the potential impact of national trends on local voting behavior.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any prominent South Dakota political figures endorsed Initiated Measure 29?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any prominent South Dakota political figures endorsing Initiated Measure 29, the marijuana legalization initiative. The sources discuss the campaigns, arguments, and polling data, but they do not specify endorsements from prominent political figures.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant funding and active campaigning supporting Initiated Measure 29?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not offer specific information about the funding or the extent of campaigning for South Dakota Initiated Measure 29.\n\n- The sources discuss the details of the measure itself, such as what it would do if passed, but they do not provide information on the funding or campaigning efforts.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Initiated Measure 29 confirmed to be on the ballot for the November 5, 2024, South Dakota general election?\nANSWER: YES, Initiated Measure 29 is confirmed to be on the ballot for the November 5, 2024, South Dakota general election. This is indicated in multiple sources, including the Ballotpedia articles and the South Dakota Secretary of State's information.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are recent opinion polls indicating that a majority of South Dakota voters support legalizing recreational marijuana?\nANSWER: No, recent opinion polls do not indicate that a majority of South Dakota voters support legalizing recreational marijuana. According to the polls mentioned, a majority of voters are opposed to the initiative. For example, a poll conducted by South Dakota News Watch/Chiesman Center for Democracy from May 10-13, 2024, showed that 51.8% of registered voters opposed the recreational marijuana initiative, while 41.6% supported it.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has public opinion in South Dakota shifted significantly in favor of marijuana legalization since the 2022 vote?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, public opinion in South Dakota does not appear to have shifted significantly in favor of marijuana legalization since the 2022 vote.\n\n- In the 2022 election, the marijuana legalization measure (Initiated Measure 27) was defeated with 52.92% of voters opposing it.\n- Recent polls conducted in 2024 show that while there is some support, the majority of voters still oppose the latest attempt to legalize recreational marijuana. For example, a poll from October 2024 indicated that 51% of respondents opposed Initiated Measure 29, with 44% supporting it.\n\nThese figures suggest that the level of support has not significantly increased since the 2022 vote, and opposition remains a slim majority.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major organizations or influential groups in South Dakota actively opposing Initiated Measure 29?\nANSWER: Yes, major organizations and influential groups in South Dakota are actively opposing Initiated Measure 29, which aims to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.\n\n- The Catholic dioceses of South Dakota have released a joint statement opposing Measure 29, citing concerns about the potency of marijuana, its impact on mental health, and its potential to increase youth consumption and other social problems.\n- Protecting South Dakota Kids, an advocacy organization, is also opposing Measure 29, claiming that it would lead to various negative outcomes such as child abuse, teen suicide, and traffic fatalities.\n- The South Dakota Republican Party adopted a resolution in June 2024 urging its members to support the campaign to defeat Initiated Measure 29.\n\nThese groups are actively campaigning and advocating against the passage of Measure 29.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have neighboring states legalized recreational marijuana in a way that might influence South Dakota voters?\nANSWER: To determine if neighboring states have legalized recreational marijuana in a way that might influence South Dakota voters, we need to look at the current legal status of marijuana in the states bordering South Dakota.\n\nSouth Dakota is bordered by North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Minnesota.\n\n- **North Dakota**: As of the provided sources, there is no mention of North Dakota legalizing recreational marijuana.\n- **Nebraska**: There is no indication in the sources that Nebraska has legalized recreational marijuana.\n- **Wyoming**: The sources do not mention Wyoming having legalized recreational marijuana.\n- **Minnesota**: While the sources do not specifically address Minnesota's current status, as of the latest available information, Minnesota has not legalized recreational marijuana at the state level, although there may be ongoing discussions or legislative efforts.\n\nGiven the information from the sources, it appears that none of the neighboring states have legalized recreational marijuana, which could potentially influence South Dakota voters in this context.\n\n### Answer:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any recent legislation or legal decisions in South Dakota affecting marijuana policy?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been recent developments and legal decisions in South Dakota affecting marijuana policy.\n\n## Recent Legislation and Initiatives\n- South Dakota voters will be considering Initiated Measure 29 on November 5, 2024, which aims to legalize the recreational use, possession, and distribution of marijuana for individuals 21 and older. This is the third time such a measure will be put to voters after previous attempts in 2020 and 2022.\n\n## Previous Legal Decisions\n- In 2020, voters approved Constitutional Amendment A, which legalized recreational marijuana, but it was later overturned by the South Dakota Supreme Court in 2021 due to a ruling that it violated the state's single-subject rule.\n\n## Medical Marijuana\n- Despite the setback on recreational marijuana, the medical marijuana program established by Initiated Measure 26 in 2020 remains in effect. This program allows patients with qualifying medical conditions to use and possess medical cannabis, and the first licensed dispensary began selling medical cannabis in July 2022.\n\n## Legislative Actions\n- In 2021, Governor Kristi Noem attempted to delay the implementation of the medical marijuana law, but this attempt was defeated by advocates.\n\nThese developments indicate ongoing activity and changes in marijuana policy in South Dakota.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of demographic changes in South Dakota that could increase support for marijuana legalization?\nANSWER: There are some indications and discussions about demographic and attitudinal shifts that could potentially influence support for marijuana legalization in South Dakota, although the evidence is not conclusive.\n\n1. **Age Groups**: Polls indicate that younger voters are more supportive of marijuana legalization. For example, the youngest age group (18-34) shows the highest support, with 60% in favor in one context, though this support is not universally high across all polls.\n\n2. **Party Affiliation**: There is a significant difference in support based on party affiliation. Democrats and Independents show higher levels of support compared to Republicans. This suggests that any shift in party affiliation or voter turnout could impact the overall support for the measure.\n\n3. **Previous Voting Patterns**: The 2020 election saw a higher level of support for recreational marijuana, with 54% of voters approving it, although it was later invalidated by the court. This historical support suggests that there is a base of voters who have previously been in favor, and their continued support or increased turnout could influence the outcome.\n\n4. **Changing Voter Stances**: There is an indication that some voters who previously supported medical marijuana but were uncertain about recreational marijuana are reconsidering their stance now that medical marijuana is in place. This could lead to increased support for recreational marijuana.\n\nHowever, despite these points, the overall polls still show that more than half of the voters oppose the measure, indicating that while there are demographic and attitudinal shifts, they may not be sufficient to tip the balance in favor of legalization at this time.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have national trends and increasing acceptance of recreational marijuana influenced voter attitudes in South Dakota?\nANSWER: The information available suggests that national trends and increasing acceptance of recreational marijuana have had some impact on voter attitudes in South Dakota, although the extent and consistency of this influence are mixed.\n\n1. **Changing Attitudes Over Time**: Despite previous failures to legalize recreational marijuana in 2022, there are indications that attitudes towards cannabis are changing. For example, a poll mentioned in one source shows that a majority of residents might be in favor of legalizing adult-use marijuana in 2024, with 53% supporting the measure.\n\n2. **Comparative Support**: The support levels have fluctuated, but there is a noticeable trend of ongoing debate and consideration. In 2020, a constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana passed with 54% of the vote, though it was later overturned by the South Dakota Supreme Court. This shows a significant level of initial support, even if it was not sustained due to legal challenges.\n\n3. **Persistent Advocacy**: The continued efforts by groups like South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws and the collection of signatures to put the measure on the ballot indicate that there is a persistent and growing movement towards legalization, influenced by national trends and increasing acceptance elsewhere.\n\n4. **Mixed Poll Results**: However, not all polls show a clear majority in favor. A poll from June 2024 indicated that 52% of respondents were against the latest initiative, while 42% supported it. This mixed response suggests that while there is some influence from national trends, it is not uniform or decisive.\n\nIn summary, while national trends and increasing acceptance of recreational marijuana have influenced voter attitudes in South Dakota, the impact is not uniform and voter opinions remain divided.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 5 days (from October 31, 2024, to November 5, 2024).\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If nothing changed between now and Election Day, Initiated Measure 29 would likely be rejected by voters, resulting in a **No** outcome.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With approximately 1.25 days left, the forecast would remain similar, with perhaps slightly increased certainty that the measure would not pass.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:** With 20 days remaining, there would be more time for campaigning and potential shifts in public opinion. However, given current trends and opposition, the probability of the measure passing would remain low, though uncertainty might be slightly higher.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Context:**\n  - In **2020**, South Dakota voters approved Constitutional Amendment A to legalize recreational marijuana with 54% support, but it was struck down by the state Supreme Court due to a procedural issue.\n  - In **2022**, Initiated Measure 27 was **rejected** by voters, with **52.92%** opposing and **47.08%** supporting legalization.\n  - This indicates consistent resistance to legalizing recreational marijuana in recent years.\n\n- **Current Polling Data:**\n  - An October 2024 poll shows **51%** of respondents **opposed** Initiated Measure 29, while **44%** supported it.\n  - Previous polls in May and June 2024 also indicated opposition exceeding support by similar margins.\n  - These polling trends suggest that a majority of voters currently oppose the measure.\n\n- **Public and Organizational Stances:**\n  - **Major Opposition:**\n    - **Catholic dioceses of South Dakota** oppose the measure, citing concerns about health and social impacts.\n    - **Protecting South Dakota Kids**, an advocacy group, is actively campaigning against the measure.\n    - The **South Dakota Republican Party** has formally opposed the measure.\n  - **Lack of Prominent Endorsements:**\n    - No prominent South Dakota political figures have publicly endorsed Initiated Measure 29.\n  - This significant opposition from influential groups may sway voters against the measure.\n\n- **Demographics and Public Opinion:**\n  - While younger voters and certain demographics are more supportive of legalization, overall public opinion has not shifted significantly since the 2022 vote.\n  - The opposition maintains a slim majority, and there is no clear evidence of a substantial change in voter attitudes favoring legalization.\n\n- **Neighboring States and National Trends:**\n  - None of South Dakota's neighboring states have legalized recreational marijuana, limiting regional influence.\n  - Although **24 states** have legalized recreational marijuana nationally, local sentiments and previous voting patterns hold more weight in this context.\n\n- **Time to Resolution:**\n  - With only **5 days** until the election, there is limited time for any significant shifts in public opinion or for campaigns to alter the trajectory.\n  - Early voting may have already solidified the outcome for many voters.\n\n- **Base Rates and Statistical Considerations:**\n  - Given past election results and current polling margins, the base rate for similar measures passing under these conditions is low.\n  - Accounting for undecided voters and potential polling errors, there is still a possibility of the measure passing, but it remains unlikely.\n\n- **Potential Factors That Could Influence the Outcome:**\n  - **Voter Turnout:**\n    - Higher turnout among younger voters could increase support for the measure.\n    - However, midterm elections typically see lower turnout among younger demographics.\n  - **Last-Minute Campaigning:**\n    - Significant new endorsements or revelations could sway some voters, but there are no indications of such developments.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**Probability: 25%**",
