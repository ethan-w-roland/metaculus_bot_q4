This is evident from his appearances on podcasts like \u201cBussin' With the Boys\u201d and \u201cFlagrant,\u201d and his decision to reject traditional media interviews in favor of these platforms.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump publicly expressed interest in appearing on the 'Call Her Daddy' podcast?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Donald Trump has publicly expressed interest in appearing on the 'Call Her Daddy' podcast.

Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump appeared on similar podcasts aimed at younger or female audiences during his 2024 campaign?\nANSWER: No, Donald Trump has primarily focused on appearing on podcasts that are aimed at younger male audiences during his 2024 campaign, rather than those targeted at female or more diverse audiences.\n\n- Trump has made appearances on podcasts such as Joe Rogan's, Lex Friedman's, the Shawn Ryan Show, and the Flagrant podcast, which are predominantly male-centric and popular among younger male listeners.\n- There is no mention of him appearing on podcasts specifically targeted at female audiences, unlike Kamala Harris who has appeared on podcasts like Call Her Daddy, which is highly popular among women.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump made last-minute media appearances on major platforms close to previous election days?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that Donald Trump has a mixed record when it comes to making last-minute media appearances close to election days.\n\n- In the current election cycle, Trump has canceled several scheduled media appearances, including those on CBS's \"60 Minutes,\" CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" NBC News, the NRA's \"Defend the 2nd\" Event, and an interview with The Shade Room.\n- However, Trump has also made some media appearances, such as the recent interview with Fox News and his ongoing series of barbershop interviews conducted by 'Fox & Friends' co-host Lawrence Jones.\n\nGiven this information, it is evident that while Trump has not been as active in accepting last-minute media appearances on all major platforms, he has still engaged in some media interactions close to the election.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a pattern of political figures using popular podcasts like 'Call Her Daddy' to reach voters before elections?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a pattern of political figures using popular podcasts like 'Call Her Daddy' to reach voters before elections.\n\nSeveral sources indicate that politicians, including Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, are leveraging popular podcasts and other non-traditional media outlets to connect with specific voter demographics. Here are some key points:\n\n- Kamala Harris appeared on 'Call Her Daddy,' a podcast primarily listened to by young women, as part of her strategy to engage with this important voting block.\n- This approach is not unique to Harris; Donald Trump has also appeared on podcasts like 'Full Send,' 'This Past Weekend With Theo Von,' and 'Lex Fridman Podcast' to reach young male voters.\n- The strategy involves using these platforms to humanize the candidates and reach audiences that may not be engaged through traditional news outlets.\n- Historical precedents include Barack Obama appearing on 'Between Two Ferns' and Bill Clinton on 'The Arsenio Hall Show,' indicating that using non-traditional media to reach voters is not a new tactic but has evolved with the rise of podcasts and social media.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 12 days (from October 24, 2024, to November 5, 2024).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** *No*; Donald Trump will not appear on the 'Call Her Daddy' podcast before Election Day.\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (3 days):** Very low probability, around 1%.\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left (48 days):** Slightly higher probability, approximately 5%.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of today, there are no announcements or credible reports indicating that Donald Trump will appear on the 'Call Her Daddy' podcast before November 5, 2024. While Alex Cooper, the host of the podcast, has extended an invitation to Trump, he has not publicly accepted or shown interest in appearing on the show.\n\n**Factors Considered:**\n\n- **Invitation Status:** Alex Cooper has invited Donald Trump to appear on the podcast, but there is no evidence that he has accepted or is considering the invitation.\n\n- **Trump's Media Strategy:** Trump has a history of appearing on non-traditional media platforms to reach specific audiences, particularly younger male voters. His recent podcast appearances have been on shows like 'Full Send' and 'Flagrant,' which cater to that demographic.\n\n- **Podcast Audience and Content:** 'Call Her Daddy' primarily targets a young female audience and covers topics related to relationships and personal development. Trump has not previously appeared on podcasts with a similar audience profile during his 2024 campaign.\n\n- **Time Constraints:** With only 12 days left until Election Day, scheduling, recording, and releasing a podcast episode with a high-profile guest like Trump would be challenging. Podcasts typically promote such appearances in advance to maximize listener engagement.\n\n- **Campaign Priorities:** In the final days before the election, Trump's campaign may prioritize appearances on platforms that align more closely with his base or offer broader reach.\n\n**Alternate Time Frames:**\n\n- **With Only 3 Days Left:** The probability would be even lower (~1%) due to the logistical challenges of arranging an appearance on such short notice.\n\n- **With 48 Days Left:** The probability would increase slightly (~5%) as there would be more time for negotiations and scheduling, and the campaign might consider reaching out to different voter demographics.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the lack of current evidence supporting an upcoming appearance, combined with the logistical and strategic factors, it is highly unlikely that Donald Trump will appear on the 'Call Her Daddy' podcast before Election Day.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 2%**", "probability": 2}
