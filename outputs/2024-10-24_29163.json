{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill JD Vance cease to be Donald Trump's running mate before November 5, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-24\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if JD Vance ceases to be the Republican Party's official candidate for Vice President in the 2024 cycle, for any reason, before November 5, 2024. If this does not happen, this question resolves as No.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nOn July 31, 1972, the Democratic nominee for vice president, Thomas Eagleton, withdrew his candidacy. Information had come out that in the 1960s he had received electrical shock treatments for what was described at the time as nervous exhaustion and depression. This is an example of the unknown unknowns that can change the course of history.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nThe question of whether JD Vance will cease to be Donald Trump's running mate before the November 5, 2024, election is complex and influenced by several factors:\n\n## Controversies and Public Perception\nJD Vance has faced significant controversies, including controversial remarks about women, unfounded claims, and other public missteps, which have led to a historically low net favorable polling rating of -6, the lowest since 1980.\n\n## Logistical and Legal Constraints\nReplacing a vice-presidential nominee at this stage is logistically challenging. The ballot access deadlines for many states, including Ohio, have already passed or are imminent, which complicates the process of changing the ticket. For example, the ballot access deadline for Ohio was September 1.\n\n## Party Rules and Procedures\nAccording to the Republican National Committee's rules, a vice-presidential nominee can be replaced if they resign, fall ill, or for other reasons, but this would require a national convention or a smaller assembly of committee members to vote on a replacement.\n\n## Campaign Statements and Denials\nDespite the speculation, Trump's campaign has consistently denied any plans to replace Vance, with Trump's communications director stating that Trump is \"excited about his decision to partner with Senator Vance\".\n\n## Timing and Practicality\nGiven that voting starts in September in some states, the practicality of replacing Vance at this late stage is low. The likelihood of such a change, as indicated by betting platforms, is minimal, with only a 12% chance suggested by Polymarket.\n\n## Historical Precedents\nWhile it is technically possible to replace a vice-presidential nominee, historical precedents suggest it is rare. The last time a major party replaced its vice-presidential nominee was in 1972 when George McGovern replaced Thomas Eagleton due to health issues.\n\nIn summary, while it is not impossible for JD Vance to be replaced, the combination of logistical challenges, legal constraints, and the campaign's public stance makes it highly unlikely that he will cease to be Trump's running mate before the November 5, 2024, election.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is JD Vance currently the Republican Party's official vice-presidential nominee for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nJD Vance has been officially selected by Donald Trump as his running mate for the 2024 presidential election, and he has formally won the vice presidential nomination at the 2024 Republican National Convention.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of severe health issues that would compel JD Vance to withdraw from the vice-presidential race?\nANSWER: There is no evidence in the provided sources indicating severe health issues that would compel JD Vance to withdraw from the vice-presidential race. The sources focus on the debate performance, policy stances, and political strategies of JD Vance and Tim Walz, but do not mention any health issues related to Vance.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any official announcements been made indicating that JD Vance will be replaced as Donald Trump's running mate?\nANSWER: No official announcements have been made indicating that JD Vance will be replaced as Donald Trump's running mate. While there have been controversies and speculations about potentially replacing Vance, the sources confirm that there has been \"zero conversation\" about replacing him within the Trump campaign, and Trump has continued to defend his choice of Vance.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any influential Republican leaders publicly called for JD Vance to step down from the ticket?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no evidence of influential Republican leaders calling for JD Vance to step down from the ticket. The calls for Vance's resignation have come from Democratic figures, such as Ohio Democratic State Senator Casey Weinstein and Ohio Representative Michele Grim, who have criticized Vance for his comments and actions, particularly regarding the unfounded claims about Haitian migrants.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there historical precedents of a vice-presidential nominee being replaced this close to an election since 1972?\nANSWER: No, there are no historical precedents of a vice-presidential nominee being replaced as close to an election as the scenario described since the 1972 incident involving Thomas Eagleton.\n\nThomas Eagleton was the last vice-presidential nominee to be replaced, and this occurred on August 1, 1972, just 19 days after his nomination at the Democratic National Convention. Since then, there have been no instances of a vice-presidential nominee being replaced so close to the general election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Republican National Committee initiated any procedures to replace JD Vance as the vice-presidential nominee?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no indication that the Republican National Committee (RNC) has initiated any procedures to replace JD Vance as the vice-presidential nominee.\n\n- Despite some criticism and negative polling data regarding Vance, there are no reports of the RNC taking steps to remove him from the ticket.\n- The sources do discuss the possibility and the procedural hurdles involved in replacing a vice-presidential candidate, but they do not indicate that any such action has been initiated.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any betting markets or prediction platforms indicated a high probability of JD Vance being replaced before the election?\nANSWER: No, the sources do not indicate a high probability of JD Vance being replaced before the election. In fact, they suggest the opposite:\n\n- A betting platform, Polymarket, indicates only a 12% chance that JD Vance will be substituted as the Republican Party\u2019s vice-presidential nominee.\n- The Trump campaign has consistently stated that they are satisfied with Vance as the running mate, and there are no current indications of plans to replace him.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of Vance being replaced is considered low according to the available information. .YES, NO, or UNCLEAR:\nNO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Donald Trump's campaign expressed dissatisfaction with JD Vance or hinted at a potential change in running mate?\nANSWER: The sources indicate mixed signals but do not conclusively suggest that Donald Trump's campaign has expressed dissatisfaction to the point of considering a change in running mate.\n\n- While there are mentions of potential issues and criticisms, such as Vance's past remarks about Trump and his controversial comments, Trump's campaign has consistently rebutted claims that he regrets selecting Vance. Trump and his team have stated that they are \"thrilled\" with Vance and have expressed satisfaction with his performance, especially after the vice-presidential debate.\n\n- Anthony Scaramucci, a former White House Communications Director, suggested that Vance might be in trouble with Trump due to receiving too much attention, but this is speculative and not a direct expression of dissatisfaction from Trump's campaign.\n\n- Despite some public critiques and adjustments in their relationship, Trump has shown support for Vance and has not indicated any intention to replace him.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any significant scandals or controversies involving JD Vance emerged since his nomination that could lead to his withdrawal?\nANSWER: Since JD Vance's nomination as Donald Trump's vice presidential candidate, several significant scandals and controversies have emerged, although they have not led to his withdrawal as of now. Here are some key points:\n\n## Controversy over \"Childless Cat Ladies\" Comment\nVance faced widespread criticism for a 2021 comment where he labeled women without biological children, including Kamala Harris, as \"childless cat ladies\" with \"no direct stake\" in America. This remark was seen as sexist and out of touch, sparking outrage from various groups and individuals.\n\n## False Claims About Haitian Migrants\nVance has been involved in a controversy surrounding false claims that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people's pets. These claims were debunked by local officials and the state's Republican governor, yet they still led to harassment and bomb threats against legal immigrants.\n\n## Criticism on Feminism and Immigration\nIn a 2021 podcast, Vance made critical remarks about feminism, suggesting that professional women often choose a path that leads to suffering by prioritizing careers over motherhood. He also made disparaging comments about immigrants and specific individuals like Ilhan Omar.\n\n## Substantive Policy Disagreements with Trump\nVance has had policy disagreements with Trump, notably on the issue of a national abortion ban, where Vance suggested Trump would veto such a ban, only to be contradicted by Trump himself.\n\n## General Backlash and Low Favorability Ratings\nThese controversies have contributed to Vance recording the lowest favorability rating among this year's presidential candidates, marking one of the lowest ratings for a vice presidential nominee in recent memory.\n\nWhile these scandals and controversies have generated significant backlash, they have not resulted in Vance's withdrawal from the ticket as of now.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there legal or logistical barriers preventing the replacement of a vice-presidential nominee at this stage in the election cycle?\nANSWER: There are no significant legal barriers that would prevent the replacement of a vice-presidential nominee at this stage in the election cycle, but there are some logistical and procedural considerations:\n\n## Legal Considerations\n- The Democratic and Republican parties have their own rules for replacing a presidential or vice-presidential nominee. These rules allow for the nomination process to be adjusted even after the national convention, although the process can be complex.\n- Legal experts suggest that courts are unlikely to interfere with a party's decision to replace its nominee, as long as the party follows its own rules and state laws.\n\n## Logistical Considerations\n- Each state has its own deadlines and procedures for certifying and printing ballots, which can create logistical challenges for replacing a nominee close to the election date. Parties must ensure that the new nominee's name is submitted and certified in time for the general election.\n- The replacement process involves submitting new names to state election officials and ensuring that the necessary paperwork is filed, which can be time-consuming but is not legally prohibited.\n\n## Party Rules\n- Both the Democratic and Republican parties have mechanisms in place for filling vacancies in their tickets, such as the Republican National Committee's Rule 9, which outlines how to select a new candidate.\n\nIn summary, while there are logistical and procedural hurdles, there are no insurmountable legal barriers to replacing a vice-presidential nominee at this stage.\n\n**YES** (there are logistical and procedural barriers, but no insurmountable legal ones)", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 12 days.\n\n(b) **If nothing changes:** JD Vance will remain Donald Trump's running mate, and the question will resolve as **No**.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 3 days):** The probability of JD Vance ceasing to be the running mate would be even lower, due to the extremely limited time for any changes to occur.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left (approximately 48 days):** While additional time increases the possibility for unforeseen events, the probability would still remain low given the lack of current indications toward a replacement.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Historical Precedent:** The last major party vice-presidential nominee to be replaced this close to an election was in 1972, when Thomas Eagleton stepped down due to health concerns. This is an exceedingly rare occurrence, and no such replacements have happened in the past five decades.\n\n- **Time Constraints and Logistical Challenges:** With only 12 days left until November 5, 2024, replacing a vice-presidential nominee presents significant logistical challenges:\n  - **Ballot Access Deadlines:** Many states have already finalized their ballots. Changing the nominee would risk having the incorrect name on ballots, causing confusion and potential legal challenges.\n  - **Early and Absentee Voting:** Voting has already begun in several states. A change now could disenfranchise voters or lead to disputes over their votes.\n\n- **Official Statements and Campaign Stance:**\n  - The Trump campaign has publicly expressed confidence in JD Vance as the vice-presidential nominee.\n  - There have been no official moves by the Republican National Committee to initiate a replacement process.\n\n- **Lack of Compelling Catalysts:**\n  - **Health Issues:** There are no reported severe health concerns regarding JD Vance that would necessitate a withdrawal.\n  - **Scandals or Controversies:** While there have been controversies, none have reached a level that has prompted widespread calls within the Republican Party for his removal.\n\n- **Party Unity and Election Strategy:**\n  - Replacing a nominee this late could signal disunity and potentially harm the campaign's momentum.\n  - The focus in the final days is typically on consolidating support and executing get-out-the-vote efforts rather than making major changes.\n\n- **Betting Markets and Prediction Platforms:**\n  - Betting platforms like Polymarket suggest a low probability (around 12%) of JD Vance being replaced, reflecting market sentiment that such a change is unlikely.\n\n- **Legal and Procedural Barriers:**\n  - While there are mechanisms to replace a nominee, they involve complex procedures that are difficult to navigate on such a tight timeline.\n  - Legal challenges could arise from any attempt to alter the ticket at this stage.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the historical rarity of such an event, the significant logistical and procedural hurdles, and the absence of major catalysts necessitating a change, the likelihood of JD Vance ceasing to be Donald Trump's running mate before November 5, 2024, is very low.\n\n**Probability: 1%**", "probability": 1}
