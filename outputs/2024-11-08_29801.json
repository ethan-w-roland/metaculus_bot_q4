    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of active US oil drilling rigs be less than 585 on November 29, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-08\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of active oil drilling rigs is less than 585 on November 29, 2024, according to the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count, which can be accessed at [this](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_rotary_rigs) Ycharts link.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe link will be accessed by Metaculus Admins on or around November 29, 2024. In case of its inaccessibility, the secondary resolution source will be from Baker Hughes itself at [this link](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count). If both resolution links remain inaccessible by the end of the tournament, the question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBaker Hughes [issues](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/) US oil rig counts every Friday, and issued oil rig counts to the petroleum industry since 1944.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the number of active US oil drilling rigs being less than 585 on November 29, 2024, here are some key points and historical context that can help inform the prediction:\n\n## Current Rig Count\nAs of November 1, 2024, the total US rig count is 585, which has remained unchanged from the previous week.\n\n## Historical Trends\n- The US rig count has shown variability over the past few months but has generally been trending downward. For example, the count was 625 a year ago, indicating a decline of about 6.4% over the year.\n- In recent weeks, the rig count has been relatively stable, with some minor fluctuations. For instance, the count was 588 in early October and has since remained around 585.\n\n## Sector Dynamics\n- The oil rig count specifically is currently at 479, down from 504 a year ago. This indicates a decline in oil-focused drilling activities.\n- Gas and miscellaneous rig counts have also shown stability or slight declines, contributing to the overall trend in the total rig count.\n\n## Economic and Market Factors\n- Oil prices have been volatile, affecting drilling activities. For example, oil prices rose to $77.14 in early October but then fell back to around $71.78 by the end of October. Such price fluctuations can influence drilling decisions.\n\n## Regional Variations\n- Different regions, such as the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, and others, show varying levels of activity. For instance, the Permian Basin rig count is down slightly, while some other regions have seen minor increases or no change.\n\nGiven these points, here are some considerations for the superforecaster:\n\n### Base Rates\n- The current stability in the rig count suggests that significant changes might not be imminent, but historical data shows that rig counts can fluctuate based on economic and market conditions.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The prediction is for a specific date (November 29, 2024), which is about four weeks from the current data point. This period is long enough for market conditions or other factors to influence the rig count.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The current economic and market conditions, including oil prices and technological advancements, play a crucial role in determining drilling activities.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Historical data shows that rig counts can drop significantly in response to economic downturns or decreases in oil prices. However, recent stability suggests that a drastic drop might not be immediate.\n\nBased on this information, while it is possible that the number of active US oil drilling rigs could be less than 585 by November 29, 2024, the current stability and minor fluctuations in recent weeks do not strongly indicate a significant drop in the near term. However, the answer is not immediately clear and would depend on various factors including market conditions and economic trends over the next few weeks.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any major US oil companies announced plans to reduce drilling activities in November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about major US oil companies announcing plans to reduce drilling activities in November 2024. The sources discuss general trends and conditions in the oil and gas sector up to the third quarter of 2024, but they do not provide details about specific announcements for November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are any severe weather events or storms predicted for US oil-producing regions in November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are predictions of severe weather events or storms that could impact US oil-producing regions in November 2024.\n\nA late-season hurricane, Hurricane Rafael, is expected to affect the Gulf of Mexico, a significant region for US oil and gas production. Forecasters indicate that Rafael could intensify into a major hurricane and impact prime oil and gas production regions in the Gulf of Mexico, leading to potential shut-ins and production disruptions. This is particularly notable since November hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico are exceedingly rare.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did oil prices decrease significantly between October and November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear indication of a significant decrease in oil prices specifically between October and November 2024.\n\n- The World Bank report mentions that Brent prices gained in early October but shed those gains by the end of the month, and it projects future prices but does not provide a comparison for November 2024 specifically.\n- The Trading Economics data shows that as of November 7, 2024, Brent oil was trading at around $75.59 per barrel, which is not significantly lower than the prices mentioned in early October (around $78/bbl).\n- The IEA and EIA reports discuss price movements and forecasts but do not provide a direct comparison between October and November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the information available does not clearly indicate a significant decrease in oil prices between October and November 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has new environmental or regulatory legislation affecting oil drilling been enacted in the US in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, new environmental and regulatory legislation affecting oil drilling has been enacted in the US in 2024.\n\n- The Biden administration has unveiled new regulations to strengthen land conservation in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, establishing stronger protections against oil-and-gas development for designated Special Areas and prohibiting new oil-and-gas leasing for 10.6 million acres of the Reserve.\n- The Biden administration has also introduced a new rule increasing the rate and minimum price that fossil fuel companies must pay for drilling on public lands, aiming to address the environmental impacts of drilling and hold companies accountable for cleaning up abandoned wells.\n- In California, Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation allowing local communities to restrict oil drilling, address idle wells, and impose stricter regulations on oil and gas operations near schools, daycares, and other sensitive areas.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the number of active US oil drilling rigs decreased in the past four weeks leading up to November 8, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- As of November 1, 2024, the number of active US oil drilling rigs was 479, which is unchanged from the previous week but has fluctuated slightly over the past four weeks.\n- Here is a breakdown of the oil rig counts for the relevant weeks:\n  - November 1, 2024: 479 oil rigs.\n  - October 25, 2024: 480 oil rigs.\n  - October 18, 2024: 479 oil rigs.\n  - October 11, 2024: 481 oil rigs.\n\nGiven this data, the number of active US oil drilling rigs has not consistently decreased over the past four weeks leading up to November 8, 2024. Instead, it has remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a continuing downward trend in the US oil rig count over the past year leading up to November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence of a downward trend in the US oil rig count over the past year leading up to November 2024.\n\n- The US Oil Rig Count as of November 1, 2024, was 479, which is down from 504 rigs one year ago, representing a decline of 4.96%.\n- The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas reported that the total U.S. oil rig count declined 4.8 percent year over year in October and decreased 9.3 percent over the past three months.\n- Historical data shows that the oil rig count has been easing over the last three months, with specific declines noted in various basins such as the Permian Basin.\n\nTherefore, the evidence indicates a continuing downward trend in the US oil rig count over the past year.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do industry forecasts predict a decrease in active US oil drilling rigs by the end of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the forecasts and current trends do not strongly indicate a significant decrease in active US oil drilling rigs by the end of November 2024.\n\n- The Baker Hughes rig count reports show a relatively stable number of active drilling rigs, with minor fluctuations. As of November 1, the crude oil rig count was 479, which is in line with recent trends and not significantly lower than the previous weeks.\n- The Trading Economics forecast suggests that the crude oil rigs in the United States are expected to be around 485 by the end of the quarter, which does not indicate a decrease.\n- Other sources also reflect stability or minor changes in the rig counts, without suggesting a significant decrease by the end of November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, as the forecasts do not predict a decrease in active US oil drilling rigs by the end of November 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any scheduled events or holidays in late November 2024 that typically result in a decrease in drilling activity?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several events and holidays in late November 2024 that could potentially result in a decrease in drilling activity, although the direct impact on drilling activity is not explicitly stated. Here are some relevant events:\n\n## Thanksgiving\nThanksgiving is on November 28, 2024. This holiday is a federal holiday in the United States and typically results in a significant reduction in work activities across various industries, including those related to drilling.\n\n## Black Friday and the Following Weekend\nThe day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday (November 29, 2024), and the subsequent weekend, which includes Small Business Saturday (November 30, 2024), may also see reduced activity as many businesses and industries observe these days as part of the extended holiday weekend.\n\nThese holidays and the surrounding days often lead to a general slowdown in many types of work, including drilling activities, as many workers take time off.\n\n## Conclusion\nGiven the traditional impact of these holidays on work schedules, it is reasonable to infer that there could be a decrease in drilling activity in late November 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any geopolitical events occurred recently that might influence US oil drilling operations in November 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, several geopolitical events have recently occurred or are ongoing that could influence US oil drilling operations in November 2024:\n\n1. **Tensions in the Middle East**: The recent Israel-Iran conflict, including an Iranian missile attack on October 1, has heightened concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies. This could impact global oil markets and, by extension, US oil drilling operations.\n\n2. **US-Iran Relations**: With Donald Trump's election, there is an expectation of stricter sanctions against Iran, which could reduce Iranian crude exports and influence global oil market dynamics. This could lead to increased scrutiny of China's imports of Iranian crude and potentially affect US oil production strategies.\n\n3. **US-China Relations**: The election outcome, particularly with Trump's history of strict trade policies, could lead to tensions with China. This could impact global oil demand, especially given China's significant role in the global oil market.\n\n4. **Middle East Conflicts**: Ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, such as the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and attacks by Iran-aligned Houthi militants in the Red Sea, are disrupting energy flows and raising transit prices. These conflicts are a major concern for oil companies and could affect global energy security and US oil operations.\n\nThese geopolitical factors are likely to influence oil market stability and could have direct or indirect impacts on US oil drilling operations.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant change in global oil demand projections that could affect US drilling activity in November 2024?\nANSWER: There have been significant changes and revisions in global oil demand projections that could potentially impact various aspects of the oil market, including US drilling activity.\n\n1. **Revised Demand Forecasts**: Both the IEA and OPEC have revised their global oil demand forecasts downward for 2024 and 2025. The IEA reports that global oil demand is expected to grow by just under 900 kb/d in 2024 and around 1 mb/d in 2025, which is a sharp slowdown compared to the 2 mb/d growth seen in 2023.\n\n2. **OPEC's Revised Forecasts**: OPEC has also reduced its growth forecast for global oil demand, anticipating a more moderate growth than previously estimated. For 2024, the forecast is 104.1 million barrels per day, and for 2025, it is 105.7 million barrels per day, both of which are downward revisions from previous forecasts.\n\n3. **Impact on Oil Prices and Production**: These revisions, combined with strong supply levels and geopolitical uncertainties, are expected to keep oil prices in check. The forecasts suggest that global oil supply will exceed demand in 2025, potentially leading to an oversupply situation and downward pressure on oil prices.\n\nGiven these changes, the reduced demand growth and potential oversupply could influence US drilling activity by:\n\n- Reducing the incentive for increased drilling due to lower expected demand and potentially lower oil prices.\n- Reflecting in the overall market sentiment and investment decisions in the oil sector.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time until outcome is known:** Approximately **21 days** remain until November 29, 2024.\n\n**(b) Outcome if nothing changed:** If the rig count remains at **585**, the answer would be **No**, as the number would not be less than 585.\n\n**(c) Forecast with a quarter of the time left:** With approximately **5 days** left, minimal changes are likely. I would adjust the probability to **45%** that the count drops below 585.\n\n**(d) Forecast with 4x the time left:** With about **84 days** (12 weeks) remaining, there's more opportunity for trends to influence the count. I would increase the probability to **65%** that the count drops below 585.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Rig Count Stability:** As of November 1, 2024, the total U.S. rig count is **585**, unchanged from the previous week. Recent weeks have shown minor fluctuations but overall stability.\n  \n- **Historical Trend:** Over the past year, there has been a **downward trend** in the rig count, decreasing from 625 to 585, a decline of about **6.4%**. The oil rig count specifically declined from 504 to 479 rigs.\n\n- **Recent Fluctuations:** In the past four weeks, the oil rig count has fluctuated slightly between **479 and 481 rigs**, showing stability without a consistent decrease.\n\n- **Seasonal Factors:** Late November includes **Thanksgiving** and associated holidays, which may lead to temporary reductions in drilling activity. While these might not significantly impact the rig count, they could contribute to a minor decrease.\n\n- **Severe Weather Events:** The predicted arrival of **Hurricane Rafael** in the Gulf of Mexico could lead to temporary shutdowns and disruptions in drilling activities, potentially reducing the active rig count.\n\n- **Regulatory Changes:** New environmental regulations introduced in 2024 aim to restrict oil drilling in certain areas. While these policies have long-term implications, their immediate impact within the next three weeks may be limited.\n\n- **Geopolitical Factors:** Ongoing geopolitical tensions and conflicts could influence oil markets. However, these events might encourage maintaining or increasing domestic drilling to ensure energy security, possibly counteracting factors that would decrease the rig count.\n\n- **Market Projections:** Industry forecasts do not predict a significant decrease in the active rig count by the end of November 2024. The rig count is expected to remain stable, with minor adjustments based on market conditions.\n\n- **Global Oil Demand:** Revised forecasts show a slowdown in global oil demand growth. This could lead to cautious behavior among drilling companies, possibly resulting in slight reductions in active rigs.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the balance of factors, including slight downward trends, potential disruptions from holidays and weather events, and the need for only a minor decrease to meet the condition (<585 rigs), there is a modest likelihood that the rig count will drop below 585 by November 29, 2024.\n\n**Probability: 55%**",
