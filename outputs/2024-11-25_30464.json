    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the year-over-year increase in rent in Providence, RI in November 2024 be greater than or equal to 5.0%, according to Zillow?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Zillow reports in its [Housing Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) resource page that its Observed Rent Index for Providence, RI, has risen by â‰¥5.0% for November 2024. If this does not occur, then this resolves as **No**. The figure can be accessed either through observing the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) chart or through the CSV file. To download the CSV, under RENTALS, make sure Data Type is set to \"ZORI (Smoothed): All Homes Plus Multifamily Time Series\" and Geography is set to \"Metro & U.S.\" The RegionName \"New York, NY\" in the CSV will be used, specifically by looking at the year-over-year increase from November 2023 to November 2024. (First divide current value by prior value, then subtract one, then multiply by 100%.)\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that the instructions on how to access the CSV are provided for convenience only; according to Zillow, \"We make frequent changes to the download paths for CSVs.\" In the event the location of the data has changed, the question resolves based on the new location. The question will resolve as soon as the data is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date and the data has been reported. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. In the event the chart and CSV report different figures, the CSV will take precedence.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Zillow, housing data is updated on the 12th of each month.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if the year-over-year increase in rent in Providence, RI in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 5.0% according to Zillow, here are some relevant points:\n\n1. **Recent Trends**: As of the latest data available up to October 2024, Providence, RI has seen significant rent increases. For example, rents in Providence increased by 16.18% year-over-year as of August 2024, making it one of the areas with the highest rent growth[2][3].\n\n2. **Specific Year-Over-Year Increase**: In the most recent reports, Providence, RI is mentioned to have a year-over-year rent increase of 5.8% as of the data up to September 2024[3].\n\nGiven that the data from August and September 2024 shows a year-over-year increase of around 5.8%, it is plausible that the increase in November 2024 could remain in a similar range or slightly fluctuate. However, without the exact November 2024 data, it is not possible to definitively state whether the increase will be exactly greater than or equal to 5.0%.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The Northeast region, where Providence is located, continues to experience high demand and significant rent increases, which supports the likelihood of continued growth[2][3].\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The rental market is characterized by strong demand, limited supply in some areas, and ongoing construction that may eventually stabilize or reduce rent growth[2][3][4].\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- Since the question pertains to a specific month (November 2024), the answer would depend on the latest available data from Zillow, which might not be released yet.\n\nIn summary, while the recent trends suggest that Providence, RI has been experiencing significant rent increases, the exact year-over-year increase for November 2024 is not yet available. Therefore, it cannot be clearly answered as yes or no based on the current information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Providence, RI experienced a year-over-year rent increase in each of the past three months?\nANSWER: The information provided does not specify the month-by-month or recent rent increase trends in Providence, RI, for the past three months. The sources discuss general trends, proposed legislation, and existing regulations but do not provide the specific data needed to determine if there has been a year-over-year rent increase in each of the past three months.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the population of Providence, RI grown in 2024 compared to 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the available data, the population of Providence, RI in 2023 was 190,792[1][4].\n\nFor 2024, the estimated population of Providence is 190,807, which is an increase of 15 people from the 2023 population[4].\n\nTherefore, the population of Providence, RI has grown, albeit very slightly, in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Zillow updated its methodology for calculating the Observed Rent Index in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Zillow updated its methodology for calculating the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) in 2024. The methodology described in the sources, particularly in [1] and [3], outlines the current approach used by Zillow, but there is no mention of any updates or changes made specifically in 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as the sources do not provide information about any methodology updates in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant reduction in available rental properties in Providence, RI in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no indication of a significant reduction in available rental properties in Providence, RI in 2024.\n\n- The Zillow source updated in August 2024 mentions that there are currently **671** rentals available in Providence, RI, but it does not provide a historical context or comparison to previous years that would indicate a significant reduction[1].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have new housing construction projects in Providence, RI been delayed or halted in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that new housing construction projects in Providence, RI have been halted in 2024. However, there are mentions of past and potential delays:\n\n- The city has implemented a streamlined review process to reduce delays and expedite new construction projects[1][5].\n- Historic preservation initiatives and zoning regulations could potentially increase the cost of construction and lead to longer approval processes, but this does not mean projects have been halted[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether new housing construction projects have been delayed or halted in 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an increasing demand for rental properties in Providence, RI as of 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there is an increasing demand for rental properties in Providence, RI as of 2024.\n\n- The YouTube video discusses how the demand for rental properties in the Providence area continues to exceed the housing supply, driving rental demand and predicting year-over-year rental price increases[1].\n- Zillow's market trends indicate that despite some fluctuations, the median rent in Providence has remained relatively high, and the market temperature suggests increasing demand compared to the national average[2].\n- The Rhode Island housing market trends also highlight the competitive nature of the rental market, with low inventory and high demand contributing to the ongoing demand for rental properties[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the overall inflation rate in Providence, RI increased compared to the previous year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the relevant information:\n\n- As of July 2024, Rhode Island, which includes Providence, experienced a 17% increase in prices of goods and services since January 2021, and this rate has been increasing over time due to various factors such as supply chain disruptions and higher production costs[1][2].\n- The national and regional data indicate that inflation rates have been higher than pre-pandemic levels, although they have been cooling down slowly. For the Northeast Region, which includes Rhode Island, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was up 3.5% from October 2023 to October 2024[3].\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that the overall inflation rate in Rhode Island, and by extension in Providence, has increased compared to the previous year.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have rent control or housing regulations in Providence, RI been tightened in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether rent control or housing regulations in Providence, RI have been tightened in 2024.\n\n- There are several proposals and bills introduced in 2024 aimed at implementing or strengthening rent control and housing regulations, such as Rep. Enrique Sanchez's bill, Senate Bill S2417, and the proposal by Direct Action for Rights and Equality. However, these proposals have not yet been enacted into law[1][2][3].\n- The City Council of Providence has considered various ordinances, including those related to affordable housing and rent stabilization, but there is no indication that these have been finalized or implemented as of the current date[1][2].\n- The only recent legislative change mentioned is a new state law increasing the notice period for rent increases, which is a statewide measure and not specific to Providence[5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as there is no definitive evidence that rent control or housing regulations in Providence have been tightened in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have utility costs in Providence, RI risen significantly in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, utility costs in Providence, RI have risen significantly in 2024, particularly for the winter period.\n\n- The winter electric rate for Rhode Island Energy, which affects many residents, has been approved to increase to 16.4 cents per kilowatt hour from October 1 to March 31, 2024. This represents a 22.8% increase over the current summer rate and, although lower than the previous winter, is still higher than pre-pandemic levels[3][4].\n- For the average residential customer using 500 kWh per month, the monthly bill is expected to increase by $31.30, making the average monthly bill $168.84, which is higher than current bills but slightly lower than last winter's bills[3].\n- Even for communities like Providence that participate in electric aggregation programs, the winter rates, such as the Providence Community Electricity Program, are set at competitive but still elevated levels, with the standard rate at 16.287 cents/kWh[1].\n\nThese increases are driven by higher demand for natural gas and global geopolitical events affecting energy prices[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the unemployment rate in Providence, RI decreased from November 2023 to November 2024?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not contain specific unemployment rate data for Providence, RI, for both November 2023 and November 2024.\n\n- The source from USAFacts provides unemployment rates for September 2024 but does not include data for November 2024 or a direct comparison to November 2023 for Providence, RI specifically[2].\n- The Rhode Island Department of Labor & Training reports do not include the specific unemployment rates for November 2023 and November 2024 for Providence, RI[1][4].\n- The Bureau of Labor Statistics report mentions metropolitan areas but does not provide the specific data needed for a comparison between November 2023 and November 2024 for Providence, RI[3].\n\nTherefore, the information available is insufficient to determine if the unemployment rate in Providence, RI decreased from November 2023 to November 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.**\n- **0 days remaining**. As of today's date, November 25, 2024, Zillow has likely already reported the Observed Rent Index for November 2024.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed.**\n- **Yes**. If existing trends continue without any significant market or policy changes, the year-over-year rent increase in Providence, RI, would remain at or above 5.0%.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left.**\n- **70% Probability**. With limited time remaining, there's a higher level of uncertainty, but given the recent consistent increases, there's a strong likelihood that the rent increase meets or exceeds the 5.0% threshold.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left.**\n- **75% Probability**. With an extended timeframe, additional factors could influence rent trends. However, the sustained demand and limited supply support a continued increase, slightly enhancing confidence in the outcome.\n\n**Rationale:**\nAs of the latest available data up to September 2024, Providence, RI, has experienced a year-over-year rent increase of approximately 5.8%, indicating a robust and consistent upward trend in rental prices. The population has seen a marginal increase, and demand for rental properties remains high, further supporting continued rent growth. Utility costs have risen, which can contribute to higher overall living expenses, potentially impacting rent prices. Additionally, there have been no significant policy changes or housing supply increases that might mitigate rent growth. \n\nGiven that the resolution date is imminent, and considering the stability in the factors influencing rent increases, the likelihood that Zillow's Observed Rent Index reports a year-over-year increase of 5.0% or more for November 2024 is high. While minor fluctuations are possible, the overarching trend suggests that the threshold will be met or surpassed.\n\n**Probability: 75%**",
