    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Republican Congressman Anthony D'Esposito be re-elected in New York's 4th Congressional District in the 2024 election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-31\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Anthony D'Esposito wins the election to the House of Representatives from New York's 4th Congressional District in the 2024 US general election. If any other candidate wins, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [New York's 4th Congressional District](https://ballotpedia.org/New_York%27s_4th_Congressional_District). The 2024 US general election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Republican Congressman Anthony D'Esposito being re-elected in New York's 4th Congressional District in the 2024 election, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Incumbency and Previous Election\n- Anthony D'Esposito is the incumbent and won the 2022 election with a narrow margin of 51.8%-48.2% against his current opponent, Laura Gillen.\n\n## District Characteristics\n- The district has historically leaned Democratic, but D'Esposito is the first Republican to represent the 4th District since 1997. According to redistricting analysis, Joe Biden would have won the district in the 2020 presidential election with a 56.8%-42.2% margin if the current district lines had been in place.\n\n## Campaign Finance\n- Both D'Esposito and Gillen have significant campaign funds. As of recent reports, D'Esposito had raised $4.4 million and had $1.17 million on hand, while Gillen had raised $3.2 million and spent $730,410.\n\n## Political Environment\n- The district is considered a key target for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), indicating it is seen as a competitive and potentially winnable seat for Democrats.\n- D'Esposito's campaign emphasizes his moderate stance and bipartisan work, which may appeal to voters who feel Democrats have moved too far to the left.\n\n## Controversies and Challenges\n- D'Esposito faces controversy over his hiring practices and has been criticized by Gillen for prioritizing partisan votes over district needs.\n\n## General Election Context\n- The general election is set for November 5, 2024, and all 435 U.S. House seats are up for election. The current Republican majority in the House is slim, with 220 to 212 seats and three vacancies.\n\nGiven these points, while D'Esposito has the advantage of incumbency and a track record of winning in a challenging district, the race is highly competitive and targeted by Democrats. The outcome is not clear-cut and will depend on various factors including voter turnout, campaign effectiveness, and the broader political climate.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, it is not possible to definitively answer whether Anthony D'Esposito will be re-elected with a simple \"yes\" or \"no.\" The election outcome remains uncertain and subject to various influences.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Anthony D'Esposito running for re-election in New York's 4th Congressional District in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAnthony D'Esposito is indeed running for re-election in New York's 4th Congressional District in 2024, as indicated in multiple sources.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Laura Gillen the Democratic candidate for New York's 4th Congressional District in the 2024 election?\nANSWER: YES\n\nLaura Gillen advanced from the Democratic primary for the U.S. House New York District 4 and will be the Democratic candidate in the 2024 general election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Joe Biden win New York's 4th Congressional District in the 2020 presidential election?\nANSWER: Yes, Joe Biden won New York's 4th Congressional District in the 2020 presidential election. According to the sources, Biden dominated in the district by nearly 15 points in 2020.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any prominent third-party candidates running in New York's 4th Congressional District in the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any prominent third-party candidates running in New York's 4th Congressional District in the 2024 election. The sources primarily focus on the Republican incumbent, Anthony D'Esposito, and the Democratic challenger, Laura Gillen, without mentioning any significant third-party candidates.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current opinion polls showing Anthony D'Esposito leading in New York's 4th Congressional District for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the current opinion polls do not indicate that Anthony D'Esposito is leading conclusively in New York's 4th Congressional District for the 2024 election. A poll from Gotham Polling & Analytics mentioned in the sources shows that D'Esposito and his opponent, Gillen, are in a \"dead heat\" with D'Esposito polling at 46% of likely voters.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee actively targeting New York's 4th Congressional District in 2024?\nANSWER: YES, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is actively targeting New York's 4th Congressional District in 2024.\n\n- The DCCC has included New York's 4th Congressional District in their list of targeted districts, with Laura Gillen challenging incumbent Republican Anthony D'Esposito.\n- Gillen has been added to the DCCC's \"Red to Blue\" program, indicating a high level of support for her campaign, including strategic guidance, fundraising, and organizational assistance.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Anthony D'Esposito been involved in any significant controversies or scandals since the 2022 election?\nANSWER: YES\n\nSince the 2022 election, Anthony D'Esposito has been involved in a significant controversy related to ethics violations. Reports from various sources, including the New York Times, allege that he hired his fiancée's daughter and a woman with whom he was having an affair for part-time jobs in his district office, potentially violating House ethics rules that prohibit nepotism and employing close family members or romantic partners. This controversy has sparked considerable attention and criticism, particularly as D'Esposito is in a tight reelection battle.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does New York's 4th Congressional District have a history of re-electing incumbent representatives?\nANSWER: New York's 4th Congressional District has a mixed history regarding the re-election of incumbent representatives, but there are several instances where incumbents were successfully re-elected.\n\n- Carolyn McCarthy, a Democratic representative, was re-elected multiple times from 1997 to 2014, indicating a period of stability with an incumbent being re-elected.\n- However, there have also been instances of incumbents not seeking re-election or being replaced. For example, Kathleen Rice did not seek re-election in 2022, leading to a new representative, Anthony D'Esposito, being elected.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that while there have been periods where incumbents were re-elected, it is not a universal rule for the district.\n\n**YES**, the district does have a history of re-electing incumbent representatives, but it is not a consistent pattern.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Anthony D'Esposito raised more campaign funds than his main opponent for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer to whether Anthony D'Esposito has raised more campaign funds than his main opponent for the 2024 election is unclear from the specific data given.\n\nThe source from NY1 provides fundraising figures for the first quarter of 2024, where it is mentioned that Laura Gillen, D'Esposito's main opponent, raised more than double what D'Esposito raised in that quarter. Here are the figures:\n\n- Anthony D’Esposito (R): Receipts in Q1 - $261,609.62\n- Laura Gillen (D): Receipts in Q1 - $560,437.75.\n\nHowever, this data only covers the first quarter of 2024 and does not provide a comprehensive picture of the entire campaign period. Therefore, it is unclear whether D'Esposito has raised more overall.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the overall political climate in New York shifted in favor of Republicans since the 2022 election?\nANSWER: The overall political climate in New York has shown some shifts, but it is not a clear-cut shift entirely in favor of Republicans since the 2022 election.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\n- In the 2022 elections, Republicans did gain seats in New York, particularly in suburban areas, which contributed to their slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. This indicated a temporary shift in some districts.\n- However, recent polls and analyses suggest that the Democratic Party has regained some ground. For example, Kamala Harris, who is now the Democratic presidential candidate after Joe Biden dropped out, has a significant lead over Donald Trump in New York, and Democrats are making concerted efforts to reclaim the seats they lost in 2022.\n- While some Republican incumbents are still competitive, especially in suburban areas, there are indications that Democratic strategies and the presence of Kamala Harris on the ticket could lead to higher Democratic turnout and potentially reverse some of the 2022 losses.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as the political climate is complex and dynamic, with both parties having strengths and weaknesses in different areas of the state.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThe general election is on **November 5, 2024**, which is in **5 days**. The outcome will likely be known within a day or two after the election, so the total time until the result is known is approximately **6-7 days**.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf the election were held today under the current circumstances, it is likely that **Laura Gillen** would win the seat, defeating incumbent Anthony D'Esposito. The combination of the district's Democratic lean, D'Esposito's controversies, and strong Democratic efforts suggest a shift in favor of the Democratic candidate.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **1-2 days** left until the election, the forecast would remain similar, potentially with increased confidence in a Democratic win due to limited time for any significant changes that could favor D'Esposito.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **20-25 days** left until the election, there would be more opportunity for campaign developments. D'Esposito could potentially mitigate controversies or shift voter sentiment, slightly improving his chances, but the fundamental factors would still present significant challenges.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSeveral key factors influence the probability of Anthony D'Esposito being re-elected:\n\n- **District's Partisan Lean:** New York's 4th Congressional District has historically favored Democrats. In the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden won the district by a significant margin (~15 points). This Democratic inclination suggests that the district may prefer a Democratic candidate unless there are strong reasons to support a Republican incumbent.\n\n- **Incumbency Advantage:** While incumbents generally have advantages such as name recognition and established political networks, D'Esposito's initial victory was narrow, and in a midterm election that favored Republicans in certain areas.\n\n- **Controversies:** D'Esposito faces allegations of ethics violations related to hiring practices, which could damage his reputation and diminish voter support. Such controversies are particularly impactful in competitive districts.\n\n- **Democratic Opposition:** Laura Gillen is a strong candidate with substantial fundraising totals and support from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's \"Red to Blue\" program. This indicates national-level support and resources dedicated to flipping the seat.\n\n- **Polling Data:** Recent polls indicate a \"dead heat,\" but in a district that leans Democratic, undecided voters may more likely break towards the Democratic candidate, especially given the incumbent's controversies.\n\n- **Campaign Finance:** While both candidates have raised significant funds, Gillen's fundraising momentum may give her an edge in the final days of the campaign, allowing for more effective voter outreach and advertising.\n\n- **Political Climate:** The broader political environment, including high-profile races and national issues, could influence voter turnout. Given the district's demographics and historical voting patterns, increased turnout may benefit the Democratic candidate.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of Anthony D'Esposito being re-elected is assessed to be relatively low. The combination of a strong Democratic challenger, the district's partisan lean, and the incumbent's vulnerabilities suggests that D'Esposito faces an uphill battle to retain his seat.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
