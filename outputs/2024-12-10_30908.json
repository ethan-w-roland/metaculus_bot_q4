    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the year-over-year increase in rent in Dallas, TX in November 2024 be greater than or equal to 0.0%, according to Zillow?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-10\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Zillow reports in its [Housing Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) resource page that its Observed Rent Index for Dallas, TX has risen by â‰¥0.0% for November 2024. If this does not occur, then this resolves as **No**. The figure can be accessed either through observing the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) chart or through the CSV file. To download the CSV, under RENTALS, make sure Data Type is set to \"ZORI (Smoothed): All Homes Plus Multifamily Time Series\" and Geography is set to \"Metro & U.S.\" The RegionName \"Dallas, TX\" in the CSV will be used, specifically by looking at the year-over-year increase from November 2023 to November 2024. (First divide current value by prior value, then subtract one, then multiply by 100%.)\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that the instructions on how to access the CSV are provided for convenience only; according to Zillow, \"We make frequent changes to the download paths for CSVs.\" In the event the location of the data has changed, the question resolves based on the new location. The question will resolve as soon as the data is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date and the data has been reported. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. In the event the chart and CSV report different figures, the CSV will take precedence.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Zillow, housing data is updated on the 12th of each month. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if the year-over-year increase in rent in Dallas, TX in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 0.0% according to Zillow, here are the relevant points:\n\n- The median rent price in Dallas, TX for November 2024 is $2,009[1].\n- The median rent price in November 2023 was $2,000[1].\n\nComparing these figures, the year-over-year change from November 2023 to November 2024 is an increase of $9 ($2,009 - $2,000), which translates to a 0.45% increase.\n\nTherefore, based on the data from Zillow, the year-over-year increase in rent in Dallas, TX in November 2024 is indeed greater than 0.0%, specifically a 0.45% increase. The answer to the question is **yes**.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the overall population of Dallas, TX grown since November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there is no specific data provided that updates the population of Dallas, TX beyond the figures given for 2023.\n\n- The most recent population figures for Dallas are from 2023, showing a population of 1.32 million[5].\n- There is no source that provides population data for Dallas after November 2023.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been significant policy changes affecting the rental market in Dallas, TX since November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of significant policy changes affecting the rental market in Dallas, TX, that have occurred since November 2023.\n\n- The sources discuss current and ongoing trends, regulations, and market conditions, but they do not specify any new policy changes implemented after November 2023[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Zillow changed its methodology for calculating the Observed Rent Index since November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Zillow has changed its methodology for calculating the Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) since November 2023. The methodology described in the sources, particularly in [4], outlines the current approach used by Zillow for calculating ZORI, and there is no mention of any updates or changes to this methodology after November 2023.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the demand for rental properties in Dallas, TX increased since November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the demand for rental properties in Dallas, TX, has remained strong but the specific trend since November 2023 is not explicitly stated as an increase.\n\n- The sources indicate that the demand for rental properties in Dallas is strong and driven by job opportunities, population growth, and economic factors[1][2][4].\n- However, they also mention that while demand is strong, there have been some adjustments in the market, such as slight decreases in rental prices and higher vacancy rates due to oversupply[2][3][5].\n- There is no clear indication that demand has increased specifically since November 2023; rather, the market is described as dynamic and competitive with sustained demand.\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the supply of rental units in Dallas, TX decreased since November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the supply of rental units in Dallas, TX has not decreased since November 2023; instead, it has continued to increase or is expected to do so in the short term.\n\n- As of the first quarter of 2024, over 52,000 units were under construction in Dallas, with nearly 37,000 of those units forecasted to deliver over the next four quarters[1].\n- It is forecasted that the annual supply will peak in Dallas in the 4th quarter of 2024 at roughly 38,000 units[1].\n- Nearly 49,000 units are expected to deliver between now and the third quarter of 2024[3].\n\nTherefore, the supply of rental units is expected to continue increasing through 2024 before potentially tapering off in 2025 and beyond.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the national economic growth rate affected Dallas, TX rental markets since November 2023?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not directly address the impact of the national economic growth rate on the Dallas, TX rental markets since November 2023. However, they do discuss various factors influencing the rental market in Dallas, such as population growth, job additions, and changes in construction and vacancy rates.\n\n- The reports mention strong demand driven by job growth and population increases, but they do not explicitly link these trends to the national economic growth rate[2][3][4].\n- The rental market dynamics, including rent decreases and higher vacancy rates, are attributed to factors like new supply, construction activity, and local market conditions rather than national economic growth rates[1][2][4].\n\nGiven this, the impact of the national economic growth rate on the Dallas, TX rental markets since November 2023 is not clearly addressed in the provided sources.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the unemployment rate in Dallas, TX increased since November 2023?\nANSWER: To determine if the unemployment rate in Dallas, TX has increased since November 2023, we need to compare the unemployment rate in November 2023 with the rates in subsequent months.\n\nAs of November 2023, the unemployment rate in Dallas was 3.8%[2].\n\nFor the months following November 2023, here are the available data:\n\n- The sources provided do not give specific unemployment rates for December 2023 or later months for Dallas, TX. However, the most recent data available up to October 2024 for the Dallas-Fort Worth area shows an unemployment rate of 3.90% in October 2024, but this is for the broader metropolitan area and not specifically for Dallas[4].\n\nSince the specific unemployment rate for Dallas, TX after November 2023 is not provided in the sources, we cannot definitively say whether the unemployment rate in Dallas, TX has increased since November 2023.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been a significant increase in housing costs in neighboring cities to Dallas, TX since November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, here is the relevant information regarding housing costs in neighboring cities to Dallas, TX since November 2023:\n\n- The sources provide data on the Dallas housing market but also mention some neighboring cities. For example, the RocketHomes report mentions cities like Sunnyvale, Garland, and Northeast Dallas, which are part of the broader Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex[2].\n\n- In Sunnyvale, the median home price increased from $725,000 to $758,900, representing a 4.7% increase since November 2023[2].\n\n- In Garland, the median home price increased from $316,300 to $325,000, which is a 2.7% increase since November 2023[2].\n\n- In Northeast Dallas, the median home price increased from $392,100 to $402,900, a 2.8% increase since November 2023[2].\n\nThese figures indicate that there have been increases in housing costs in these neighboring cities, although the magnitude of the increases varies.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the inflation rate in Dallas, TX higher than it was in November 2023?\nANSWER: To determine if the inflation rate in Dallas, TX is higher than it was in November 2023, we need to compare the inflation rates for the relevant periods.\n\nAs of November 2023, the inflation rate in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area was 5.2% year-over-year[3][4].\n\nFor the period up to September 2024, the annual inflation rate in the Dallas, TX area was 2.6%[1].\n\nHowever, the key is to look at the most recent data available. The source from February 2024 indicates that prices in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area rose 0.9% for the two months ending in January 2024 and were up 5.3% over the year[4].\n\nSince the year-over-year inflation rate as of January 2024 (5.3%) is higher than the year-over-year rate as of November 2023 (5.2%), we can conclude that the inflation rate in Dallas, TX is indeed higher than it was in November 2023.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been an increase in construction of new rental properties in Dallas, TX since November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence that the construction of new rental properties in Dallas, TX has already been at a high level, but there are indications that the rate of new construction is expected to decline or has started to decline.\n\n- As of the first quarter of 2024, Dallas marked a historic milestone with annual deliveries surpassing 23,100 units, and over 52,000 units were under construction[3].\n- However, it is noted that construction starts have been impacted by tighter lending standards, rising hard costs, and other factors, leading to a decrease in new starts. For example, multifamily permits in Dallas decreased by 1,053 between August and September 2023[4].\n- The forecast suggests that the number of new units being completed will peak in 2024 and then taper off from 2025 through 2027[1][3][4].\n\nGiven this information, while there has been a high level of construction activity up to 2024, the rate of new construction is not increasing but rather expected to decrease after 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether there has been an increase in construction of new rental properties in Dallas, TX since November 2023 is:\n\n**NO**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome is known:** 2 days (Data expected on December 12, 2024)\n\n**(b) Outcome if nothing changed:** Yes (Observed Rent Index shows a 0.45% increase)\n\n**(c) Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** Yes, with high confidence given the existing data\n\n**(d) Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** Yes, maintaining strong confidence based on current indicators\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe current data indicates a year-over-year increase in the median rent price in Dallas, TX of 0.45% for November 2024 compared to November 2023. This directly meets the resolution criteria of the increase being greater than or equal to 0.0%. While there are some uncertainties regarding population growth, policy changes, and specific market dynamics, the primary data from Zillow supports a positive outcome. Given the imminent availability of the official data and the alignment of the preliminary figures with the \"Yes\" outcome, confidence in this prediction is high.\n\n**Probability: 95%**",
