    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the Mt Seymour ski resort be listed as Open by On the Snow's Ski Report on December 13, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if On the Snow's Mt Seymour Snow Report, currently located [here](https://www.onthesnow.com/british-columbia/mount-seymour/skireport), reports the ski resort's operating status as Open when accessed by Metaculus on or after December 13, 2024. If it is reported as Closed, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNo other resolution source will be considered. In case of the resolution source being down, Metaculus Admins will wait until January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be annulled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nVancouver Sun: [PSA: Metro Vancouver ski hills just received the first snow of the season](https://vancouversun.com/news/psa-metro-vancouver-ski-hills-just-received-the-first-snow-of-the-season) \"Weather experts are also betting on a snowier winter this year compared to last year\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the available information, here are the key points relevant to determining whether Mt Seymour ski resort will be listed as open on December 13, 2024:\n\n## Projected Opening Date\n- The scheduled opening date for Mt Seymour ski resort for the 2024/25 season is December 13, 2024, as stated in multiple sources[3][4][5].\n\n## Current Conditions\n- As of the current date (November 21, 2024), the resort is not yet open, with all lifts and runs closed[1][3].\n\n## Dependence on Weather and Snow Conditions\n- The opening of the ski resort is subject to favorable snow and weather conditions, but the projected opening date suggests that the resort plans to open on December 13, 2024, barring any significant changes in weather or other unforeseen circumstances[3][4].\n\nGiven this information, it is highly likely that Mt Seymour ski resort will be listed as open by OnTheSnow's Ski Report on December 13, 2024, assuming there are no unexpected delays or changes in the planned opening date. However, the final confirmation would depend on the actual conditions and any last-minute updates from the resort.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the scheduled opening date for Mt Seymour ski resort December 13, 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe scheduled opening date for Mt Seymour ski resort is projected to be December 13, 2024, as indicated in multiple sources[2][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any official announcements delaying the opening of Mt Seymour ski resort for the 2024/25 season?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there are no official announcements delaying the opening of Mt Seymour ski resort for the 2024/25 season. The estimated opening date for Mt Seymour is consistently listed as December 13, 2024, without any mention of delays[3][4][5].\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Mt Seymour ski resort currently listed as open on OnTheSnow's Ski Report before December 13, 2024?\nANSWER: No, the Mt Seymour ski resort is not currently listed as open on OnTheSnow's Ski Report before December 13, 2024.

The sources provided show that the website is actively updating and providing projected opening dates, snow reports, and other relevant information for the 2024/25 ski season.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are all lifts and runs at Mt Seymour ski resort operational on December 13, 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nThe sources provide the projected opening date for Mt. Seymour ski resort as December 13, 2024, but they do not specify whether all lifts and runs will be operational on that exact date. The opening of all lifts and runs can depend on various factors such as snow conditions, maintenance, and other external factors, which are not detailed in the provided sources[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any significant maintenance or infrastructure issues at Mt Seymour ski resort that could delay its opening?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of significant maintenance or infrastructure issues at Mt. Seymour ski resort that could delay its opening. The sources discuss weather conditions, snowfall, and operational hours, but they do not mention any maintenance or infrastructure problems.\n\n- The sources focus on weather-related issues such as lack of snow, warm temperatures, and atmospheric rivers, which have affected other ski resorts in the region but do not specify any maintenance or infrastructure issues at Mt. Seymour[1][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been sufficient snowfall and favorable weather conditions at Mt Seymour ski resort as of December 13, 2024?\nANSWER: As of the current information available up to November 21, 2024, there is no specific data on the snowfall and weather conditions at Mt Seymour ski resort for December 13, 2024.\n\n- The sources provide historical and general information about snow conditions, but they do not offer real-time or future-specific data for December 13, 2024[1][3][5].\n- The ski season is scheduled to open on December 13, 2024, but the current reports do not include conditions for that date[1].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Mt Seymour ski resort management confident in meeting the December 13, 2024 opening date?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, it is unclear whether Mt Seymour ski resort management is confident in meeting the December 13, 2024 opening date.\n\n- The sources indicate that the opening date for Mt Seymour is projected to be December 13, 2024, but they also mention that these dates are subject to change based on weather and snow conditions[2][4][5].\n- There is no explicit statement from the resort management regarding their confidence in meeting this specific date.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 23 days (from November 21, 2024, to December 13, 2024).\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changes:** Yes, the Mt Seymour ski resort will be listed as Open on OnTheSnow's Ski Report by December 13, 2024.\n\n(c) **Forecast with only a quarter of the time left (approximately 6 days):** 80%\n\n(d) **Forecast with four times the time left (approximately 92 days):** 75%\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe Mt Seymour ski resort is scheduled to open on December 13, 2024. As of November 21, 2024, all lifts and runs are closed, but there have been no official announcements indicating any delays. Weather conditions are a critical factor, and recent reports suggest a snowier winter compared to last year, which is favorable for the opening.\n\nWith 23 days remaining until the resolution date, there is sufficient time for any necessary preparations and for weather conditions to stabilize. If only six days were left, the forecast would be slightly lower due to increased uncertainty with less time to address any unforeseen issues. Conversely, if there were 92 days left, the forecast would incorporate more uncertainty over a longer period, potentially lowering confidence slightly.\n\nGiven the current information, favorable weather projections, and the scheduled opening date being consistently maintained, there is a high probability that Mt Seymour will be listed as open on the specified date.\n\n**Probability: 85%**",
