In 2023 Ukraine [commenced a counteroffensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Ukrainian_counteroffensive), though as of October 30, 2023, [Ukraine's gains have been modest](https://news.yahoo.com/ukraines-counteroffensive-has-been-slow-but-western-support-remains-strong--even-with-new-war-in-middle-east-215707295.html), and it  remains unclear how the controlled territory will shift in the long run.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1gg5PBOaPGAuOjX5kCafOgNIBMWW-ZdI&ehbc=2E312F\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether Russia will have significantly expanded its controlled territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Military Situation\nAs of November 2024, Russian forces are engaged in ongoing ground attacks and smaller tactical operations across various fronts in Ukraine, particularly in eastern Ukraine. However, these operations have been characterized by slow and marginal advances rather than significant territorial gains[3].\n\n## Russian Strategic Objectives\nRussia's strategic objectives include the subjugation of Ukraine, with specific goals such as capturing the entirety of Donetsk Oblast, pushing Ukrainian forces back from the international border, and encircling key areas. However, these objectives are part of a long-term plan, with the Russian military aiming to achieve victory by 2026 through sustained pressure and depletion of Ukrainian resources[2].\n\n## Military Capacity and Challenges\nRussian forces are facing significant material challenges and high attrition rates. Despite efforts to increase troop numbers and maintain a consistent pressure on Ukrainian forces, the Russian military is struggling with logistical setbacks and the inability of its military-industrial complex to keep up with demand. This suggests that rapid or significant expansions of controlled territory may be difficult to achieve in the short term[2][5].\n\n## Territorial Control\nAs of the current date, Russia controls only a portion of the territories it has declared as part of the Russian Federation. For example, Russia fully occupies Luhansk but only partially controls the regions of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and Donetsk. The occupation and control of these areas are maintained through fear and intimidation rather than stable governance[4].\n\n## Ukrainian Resistance and Western Support\nUkraine's resistance and the resilience of its civil society, combined with increasing Western support, suggest that Ukrainian forces are likely to remain effective in defending their territory and potentially launching counteroffensives in the future. This could further complicate Russia's efforts to expand its control significantly[5].\n\nGiven these points, while Russia may continue to make marginal advances, the likelihood of a significant expansion of its controlled territory in Ukraine by January 1, 2025, appears low due to the ongoing challenges faced by the Russian military and the robust resistance from Ukrainian forces. However, the situation remains dynamic, and any prediction would need to account for the potential for unexpected developments or changes in the military and political landscape.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any active peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine as of October 2023?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, there are no active peace negotiations directly between Russia and Ukraine. Here are the key points:\n\n- The Malta talks in October 2023 involved representatives from over 60 countries, but Russia did not participate and condemned the event as \"blatantly anti-Russian\"[3].\n- Previous rounds of negotiations had ended without significant progress, and there is no indication of ongoing direct talks between Russia and Ukraine[4].\n- The Ukrainian-backed peace plan discussions, such as those in Malta, did not include Russian participation[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there expert analysis suggesting that Russia is likely to capture additional major Ukrainian cities by January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no expert analysis suggesting that Russia is likely to capture additional major Ukrainian cities by January 1, 2025. Here are the key points:\n\n- Russia's military efforts are hindered by a declining reserve of manpower, high casualty rates, and the inability of its military-industrial complex to keep up with demand. This makes large-scale offensives to capture major cities challenging[1].\n- Russian attempts to capture strategic cities like Chasiv Yar and advances in other directions have been met with significant resistance and limited success[1][3][4].\n- The analysis indicates that Ukraine is preparing for a determined offensive in 2025, suggesting that the current trend does not favor Russian capture of major cities[1].\n\nGiven this information, the likelihood of Russia capturing additional major Ukrainian cities by January 1, 2025, appears low.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Russia announced significant increases in military conscription or mobilization as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, Russia has announced and implemented significant increases in military conscription and mobilization as of October 2023 and the surrounding period.\n\n- The maximum age for conscription has been raised from 27 to 30, effective as of January 1, 2024, but this change was made in response to earlier needs and is relevant to the current conscription campaigns[5].\n- Since the war in Ukraine began, Russia has extended compulsory military service to all citizens assigned male at birth between the ages of 18 and 30. Additionally, reservists and former contract soldiers can be called up, with an age limit of 65 years applied since May 2022[1].\n- Russia has conducted multiple conscription campaigns, including a fall call-up in 2023 that drafted 130,000 men, and a spring call-up in 2024 that drafted 150,000 men. For the fall of 2024, another 133,000 men are to be drafted[2][5].\n- There have been discussions and proposals to extend the mandatory military conscription period from one to two years, although this has not yet been implemented[3].\n\nThese changes and ongoing conscription efforts indicate significant increases in military conscription and mobilization.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Ukraine's counteroffensive making significant progress in regaining territory from Russia as of October 2023?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, Ukraine's counteroffensive is making some progress, but the extent of this progress is limited and varied across different fronts.\n\n- Ukrainian forces have reported advances in several areas, such as south of Bakhmut and in western Zaporizhia Oblast. They have achieved partial successes near settlements like Klishchiivka, Andriivka, and Kurdyumivka, and have advanced behind the railway line in various areas south of Bakhmut[1][3][5].\n- There are also reports of Ukrainian forces maintaining a limited presence in some areas near the Dnipro River shoreline and the Antonivsky railway bridge in Kherson Oblast[1].\n- However, the advances are often described as marginal or limited, and significant breakthroughs or major territorial gains are not consistently reported across all fronts[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, while Ukraine's counteroffensive is showing some progress, it is not characterized as making significant or widespread territorial gains as of October 2023.\n\n**YES**, but with the caveat that the progress is limited and not universally significant.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Russia currently preparing for a significant military offensive in Ukraine as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that Russia is continuing to engage in various military activities and preparations in Ukraine as of October 2023, but whether these activities constitute a \"significant military offensive\" can be interpreted in a few ways.\n\n- Russian forces are conducting ongoing offensive operations in several directions, including near Bakhmut, Avdiivka, and along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line. They have made some confirmed advances and are preparing for future assaults, such as the use of \"Storm-Z\" assault units and training for \"meat assaults\"[1][4].\n- Russia is also conducting missile and drone strikes against Ukraine, targeting various infrastructure and areas, which suggests ongoing military activity[1][3][4].\n- However, the sources do not indicate a large-scale, new, or particularly significant offensive campaign being prepared specifically as of October 2023. Instead, they describe ongoing and continued operations.\n\nGiven this context, the answer would be:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\nWhile Russia is certainly engaged in military activities and preparations, the sources do not provide clear evidence of a new or significantly escalated offensive campaign being prepared specifically in October 2023.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence of increasing international military support for Ukraine as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, there is evidence of increasing international military support for Ukraine as of October 2023.\n\n- The United States has continued to provide significant military aid, with commitments totaling €43.9 billion between January 24, 2022, and October 31, 2023, and additional packages announced thereafter[1][3][5].\n\n- The International Fund for Ukraine (IFU), administered by the UK Ministry of Defence, has been actively providing military equipment and support. As of October 2023, the IFU had announced several capability packages, including artillery ammunition, drones, air defence systems, and other critical military equipment[2].\n\n- The UK, along with other countries like Norway, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, and Lithuania, has contributed over £925 million to the IFU, demonstrating ongoing international support[2].\n\n- NATO and its allies have also been coordinating and increasing their military assistance, with new packages of assistance announced and a commitment to long-term, sustained support for Ukraine[5].\n\n- The European Union, through its European Peace Facility, has committed significant funds for military support to Ukraine, further indicating increased international military support[5].\n\nThese sources collectively indicate a sustained and increasing level of international military support for Ukraine as of October 2023.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been major changes in Russian military leadership or strategy as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been significant changes in Russian military leadership and strategy as of the period around and after October 2023.\n\n### Leadership Changes\n- Russian President Vladimir Putin replaced long-time Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu with Andrei Belousov, a civilian economist and former deputy prime minister, on May 12, 2024. This change indicates a shift towards a more technocratic and economically focused approach to the war effort[1][5].\n\n### Strategic Changes\n- Belousov's appointment is associated with a push to modernize the Russian military, focusing on hi-tech equipment such as unmanned vehicles, AI, and advanced intelligence systems. He is also expected to improve the procurement system, equipment, and welfare support for the military[1][5].\n- The Russian military has been undergoing force structure changes, including the creation of new military districts, the formation of new army corps and divisions, and the reorganization of existing units. These changes were initiated in 2023 and continue into 2024[4].\n- There is an emphasis on adapting the military to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, with a focus on operational reserves, manpower management, and addressing corruption within the Ministry of Defense[2][4].\n\nThese changes reflect a broader effort to adapt and improve the Russian military's performance in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there indications of declining Russian military capacity or morale as of October 2023?\nANSWER: There are several indications of declining Russian military capacity and morale as of October 2023, based on the provided sources:\n\n## Morale:\n- Russian morale has been a significant issue, with reports of low morale, supply shortages, high casualties, and logistical problems affecting the will to fight. Soldiers have reported inadequate conditions and training, and there have been instances of desertions and surrenders, particularly among newly arrived conscripts[4][5].\n- The partial mobilization in September 2022 and subsequent mobilizations have been highly unpopular, leading to protests and a decline in public support for the war. Families have had to buy equipment for their loved ones due to the lack of basic supplies, further eroding morale[4][5].\n- Despite efforts by the Russian government to positively motivate soldiers, such as offering amnesty and financial rewards to convicts drafted into the military, morale problems persist[5].\n\n## Military Capacity:\n- While Russia has made significant efforts to reconstitute its military, including increasing production of tanks, armored vehicles, and missiles, the quality of the Russian forces is unlikely to increase as long as Ukraine maintains a significant level of attrition. The Russian military continues to suffer from significant casualties, although it has managed to maintain a steady tempo of attacks[1][3].\n- The Russian military faces issues such as overcentralized command, inadequate training, and poor tactical command, which have resulted in numerous casualties and failures. Corruption within the military also impacts morale and supply chains[2][3].\n- The mutiny by Evgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner Group mercenaries in June 2023 highlighted internal vulnerabilities and leadership issues within the Russian military[2][4].\n\nIn summary, there are clear indications of both declining morale and ongoing challenges to Russian military capacity as of October 2023.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Russia control any of the following locations as of October 2023: Mikolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lozova, Sumy, or Chernihiv?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, here is the status of the mentioned locations based on the provided sources:\n\n## Mikolaiv (Mykolaiv)\n- There is no mention of Russian control over Mykolaiv in the sources. Mykolaiv is generally understood to be under Ukrainian control.\n\n## Zaporizhzhia\n- The sources indicate that Ukrainian forces were conducting offensive operations in western Zaporizhia Oblast, and there is no mention of Russian control over the city of Zaporizhzhia itself[1][2][5].\n\n## Kharkiv\n- Kharkiv is not mentioned as being under Russian control. Instead, the sources discuss Ukrainian control and Russian offensive operations in the surrounding areas[1][2][4].\n\n## Odesa\n- There is no indication that Odesa is under Russian control. The sources mention Russian strikes against port infrastructure in Odesa Oblast but do not suggest control over the city[1][2][3].\n\n## Lozova\n- Lozova is mentioned as a location where Russian forces were conducting offensive operations, but there is no confirmation that they controlled the area as of October 2023[4].\n\n## Sumy\n- There is no mention of Sumy being under Russian control in the provided sources.\n\n## Chernihiv\n- There is no mention of Chernihiv being under Russian control in the provided sources.\n\nGiven the information, it can be concluded that as of October 2023, Russia does not control any of the specified cities: Mikolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Odesa, Sumy, or Chernihiv. The status of Lozova is unclear in terms of full control but is not confirmed to be under Russian control.\n\n**UNCLEAR** for Lozova, but **NO** for the other locations.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Russia control all of the following locations as of October 2023: Simferopol, Nova Kakhovka, Svatove, Donetsk, and Tokmak?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, here is the status of the locations mentioned based on the provided sources:\n\n## Simferopol\nSimferopol is in Crimea, which has been under Russian control since the annexation in March 2014. Therefore, Russia controls Simferopol[1].\n\n## Nova Kakhovka\nNova Kakhovka is in the Kherson Oblast, which has seen significant back-and-forth control. However, as of the sources provided, it is indicated that Russian forces have maintained control over parts of the Kherson Oblast, including areas that were not retaken by Ukraine during their counteroffensives. Therefore, it is likely that Russia still controls Nova Kakhovka[2][3].\n\n## Svatove\nSvatove is in the Luhansk Oblast, and the sources indicate ongoing fighting in this area. As of October 2023, Russian forces were conducting offensive operations along the Kupyansk-Svatove-Kreminna line but had not made significant advances to fully secure the area. However, it is suggested that Russian forces were still present and active in this region, indicating they likely controlled or had significant influence over Svatove[3][4].\n\n## Donetsk\nDonetsk is a city in the Donetsk Oblast, which has been a key battleground. Russian forces and their proxies have controlled significant parts of the Donetsk Oblast, including the city of Donetsk, for some time. The sources do not indicate any change in this status as of October 2023[2][4].\n\n## Tokmak\nTokmak is in the Zaporizhia Oblast, and the sources do not provide specific details about its current status. However, given the broader context of the conflict, Tokmak is likely within the area of ongoing fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces. Without specific information, it is unclear whether Russia controls Tokmak, but it is in a region that has seen significant conflict and Russian presence[2][3].\n\n### Conclusion\n- **Simferopol**: YES, under Russian control.\n- **Nova Kakhovka**: YES, likely under Russian control.\n- **Svatove**: YES, likely under Russian control or significant influence.\n- **Donetsk**: YES, under Russian control.\n- **Tokmak**: UNCLEAR, due to lack of specific information.\n\nOverall, the control status for Tokmak is unclear based on the provided sources.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are approximately **51 days** remaining until January 1, 2025. From November 11, 2024, to January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now and January 1, 2025, the outcome would be **No**. Russia currently does not control any of the additional specified locations it needs to capture for the question to resolve as **Yes**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **13 days** left until January 1, 2025, the probability of Russia significantly expanding its controlled territory as per the criteria would be extremely low, around **1%**.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were approximately **204 days** remaining until January 1, 2025 (i.e., it is now mid-June 2024), the probability would be slightly higher but still low, perhaps around **10%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of November 11, 2024, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has been ongoing for over two and a half years. The frontlines have largely stabilized, with neither side making significant territorial gains in recent months. According to the provided information:\n\n- **Current Control:** Russia controls all the required locations except possibly Tokmak. However, they have not gained control of any of the additional seven key locations specified (Mikolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Odesa, Lozova, Sumy, Chernihiv).\n\n- **Military Capacity and Morale:** Russia faces declining military capacity and morale due to high attrition rates, logistical challenges, and inadequate training. There have been significant changes in military leadership, indicating internal issues.\n\n- **Ukrainian Resistance:** Ukraine's defense remains robust, bolstered by increasing international military support. Ukrainian forces are conducting counteroffensives and have shown resilience in defending major cities.\n\n- **Time Constraints:** With only 51 days remaining, it is highly unlikely that Russia could plan, execute, and sustain successful offensives to capture and establish control over at least two major Ukrainian cities from the specified list.\n\n- **No Indications of Imminent Offensive:** There are no credible reports of Russia preparing for a significant military offensive capable of achieving such territorial gains within the short time frame.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the above factors, the probability that Russia will significantly expand its controlled territory in Ukraine by capturing at least two of the specified locations by January 1, 2025, is very low.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
