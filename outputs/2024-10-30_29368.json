    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill SpaceX re-use a Starship booster before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-30\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if, before January 1, 2025, SpaceX successfully launches Starship using a previously flown booster.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\n- A successful launch is defined as one in which both Starship and booster leave the launchpad under their own power, and the booster separates from Starship at the intended point in flight.\n- The booster does not need to be or have been caught by the chopsticks system at any stage. Any re-use of a booster meeting the criteria will result in a **Yes** resolution.\n- In cases of ambiguity about the booster’s identity (e.g., because parts of different boosters have been combined), this question will resolve based on [the booster’s serial number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Super_Heavy#Development).\n\nBACKGROUND:\nSpaceX aims to make the entire [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship) system—both the Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft—fully reusable with a rapid turnaround between launches. To that end, SpaceX developed [a way to catch the Super Heavy booster](https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-flight-5-launch-super-heavy-booster-catch-success-video), using the launch tower. However, it is still unclear when SpaceX will re-use one of the caught boosters.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether SpaceX will reuse a Starship booster before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Successful Catch but No Immediate Reuse\nOn October 13, 2024, SpaceX successfully caught a Starship booster using the launch tower's mechanical arms, marking a significant milestone in their reusable launch system development. However, the booster that was caught is already considered outdated and will not be reused for another launch. Instead, it will be dissected to gather valuable data and improve future versions.\n\n## Rapid Iteration and Upgrades\nSpaceX is known for its rapid iteration and upgrade cycle. The boosters used in current tests are often already outdated by the time they are launched, as new designs and improvements are continuously being implemented. This means that even if a booster is recovered, it is unlikely to be reused in its current form.\n\n## Focus on Data Collection and Improvement\nThe primary goal of these test flights is to gather flight data and validate the technology, which then informs and improves the builds of future Starship versions. While the recovered boosters provide crucial insights, they are not intended for immediate reuse.\n\n## Future Plans and Developments\nSpaceX has announced new versions of the Starship, such as Block 2 and Block 3, which include significant upgrades and improvements. These new versions are expected to be more capable and reliable, but there is no clear indication that any of the currently recovered boosters will be reused before these new versions are ready.\n\nGiven this information, it is unlikely that SpaceX will reuse a Starship booster before January 1, 2025, as the focus is on gathering data, improving designs, and transitioning to newer, more advanced versions of the Starship.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has SpaceX re-used any Starship booster before October 2023?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nAs of the sources provided, the first successful catch and return of a Starship booster to the launch tower occurred on October 13, 2024, during the fifth test flight of the Starship rocket. There is no mention of any Starship booster being reused before October 2023.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is SpaceX's rapid iteration of Starship designs resulting in boosters becoming outdated quickly after a flight?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nSpaceX's rapid iteration of Starship designs is focused on improving and refining the technology, rather than making the boosters outdated quickly after a flight. The iterative approach is aimed at developing a fully reusable transportation system, where the goal is to make the boosters and the Starship itself reusable for multiple launches.\n\nFor example, the recent successful catch of the Super Heavy booster is a significant step towards reusing the boosters, indicating that the iterations are designed to enhance reusability rather than render the boosters obsolete after a single use.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has SpaceX successfully recovered a Starship booster after a flight as of October 2023?\nANSWER: NO,\n\nAs of October 2023, SpaceX had not yet successfully recovered a Starship booster after a flight. The successful recovery of the Starship booster using the \"chopstick\" arms of the launch tower occurred on October 13, 2024, during the fifth test flight of the Starship program.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does SpaceX plan to re-use Starship boosters in its flight manifest before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, SpaceX plans to reuse Starship boosters in its flight manifest before January 1, 2025. The development and testing of Starship have included successful demonstrations of the booster's reusability. For instance, on October 13, 2024, SpaceX successfully demonstrated the booster landing and catch with Booster 12, which is a key step in achieving full reusability.\n\nAdditionally, the ongoing development and testing activities, including the recent static fire test of Booster 13, indicate that SpaceX is actively working towards integrating reusable boosters into their flight manifest.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has SpaceX demonstrated the ability to re-use Falcon 9 boosters multiple times?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nSpaceX has successfully demonstrated the ability to reuse Falcon 9 boosters multiple times. Here are some key points:\n\n- The first successful landing and recovery of a Falcon 9 first stage occurred in December 2015, and the first re-flight of a landed first stage happened in March 2017.\n- By June 2020, SpaceX had recovered 53 Falcon 9 boosters, and some boosters had been reused up to five times.\n- As of recent updates, boosters have been reused numerous times, with one booster, B1051, becoming the first to launch ten missions in May 2021.\n- The turnaround time for reusing boosters has significantly decreased over the years, with the quickest turnaround time recorded at just 21 days.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any announcements from Elon Musk or SpaceX indicating plans to re-use a Starship booster in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been announcements and indications from Elon Musk and SpaceX regarding plans to reuse a Starship booster, including in 2024.\n\nElon Musk has emphasized the goal of achieving \"rapid reusability\" with the Starship program. Recent successful tests, such as the one where the Super Heavy booster was caught by mechanical arms at the launch pad, demonstrate significant progress towards this goal. Musk and SpaceX have highlighted that this capability is crucial for their vision of frequent and rapid re-launches, similar to commercial jets.\n\nAdditionally, Musk has made claims about the potential for quick turnaround times, although some of these claims, such as reusing a Starship within an hour, have been met with skepticism. However, the successful capture and potential for quick refurbishment and relaunch of the Super Heavy booster align with their broader plans for reusability in 2024 and beyond.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the development of new versions like Block 2 and Block 3 of Starship delaying the re-use of current boosters?\nANSWER: The development of new versions like Block 2 and Block 3 of the Starship is not directly delaying the reuse of current boosters. Here are the key points:\n\n- The delays in the reuse of current boosters, such as those from Block 1, are primarily due to regulatory and bureaucratic issues, including delays in obtaining launch licenses from the FAA and EPA, rather than the development of new versions.\n- SpaceX continues to work on and prepare the current Block 1 boosters for flight, despite the ongoing development of Block 2 and Block 3. For example, Ship 30 has completed its static fire campaign and is waiting for its turn to fly, although it is delayed due to regulatory issues.\n- The development of Block 2 and Block 3 is a parallel process, with SpaceX utilizing the extra time from delays to perform upgrades and reinforcements on the launch pads and to work on the new versions of the Starship.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, the development of new versions like Block 2 and Block 3 is not the primary cause of delays in reusing current boosters.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is SpaceX's current focus on data collection and design improvement rather than re-using existing Starship boosters?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that SpaceX places a significant emphasis on both data collection and design improvement, but it does not indicate that their current focus has shifted away from reusing existing Starship boosters.\n\n- SpaceX is heavily invested in data collection and using it to improve their designs and operations, as evident from the use of data engineering, real-time data visualization, and continuous improvement based on gathered data.\n- The reuse of rockets, including the Starship boosters, is a core aspect of SpaceX's strategy to reduce costs and increase efficiency. There is no indication that this focus has changed.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as to whether their current focus has shifted away from reusing existing Starship boosters, but it is clear that both data collection and design improvement, as well as rocket reuse, are important components of SpaceX's overall strategy.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there significant technical challenges remaining before SpaceX can re-use Starship boosters?\nANSWER: Yes, there are significant technical challenges remaining before SpaceX can reuse Starship boosters reliably and efficiently.\n\nSeveral sources highlight these challenges:\n- The Starship program has faced notable failures, such as the April 2023 explosion of a Starship prototype due to engine malfunctions, indicating ongoing reliability issues.\n- The new Raptor engines and the staged combustion power cycles they use pose greater risks of catastrophic failure, including issues like oxygen compatibility and metal fires.\n- The process of reusing the Starship boosters involves complex engineering, such as managing the heat and aerodynamic forces that cause warping and other damage to the engines and structure.\n- Despite the recent success in catching the booster, the reusability of Starship requires substantial modifications and addressing the narrow margin for error, especially compared to the Falcon 9.\n- Additional challenges include the need to enhance thermal shielding, manage the stress on components like turbopumps and thrust chambers, and mitigate risks such as particle impact ignition and metal fires.\n\nThese points indicate that while SpaceX has made significant progress, there are still considerable technical hurdles to overcome before achieving reliable and rapid reusability of the Starship boosters.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there regulatory or licensing issues that could prevent SpaceX from re-using Starship boosters before 2025?\nANSWER: There are indeed regulatory and licensing issues that could potentially impact SpaceX's ability to reuse Starship boosters, although it is unclear if these issues will necessarily prevent reuse before 2025.\n\n1. **Environmental Reviews and Approvals**: The FAA has been conducting extensive environmental reviews, which have caused delays in the Starship program. For example, the FAA requested additional environmental analysis for Starship Flight 5, particularly regarding the water-cooled steel flame deflector and sonic booms generated by the booster’s return and catch attempt. This has led to delays and could potentially impact future missions if similar reviews are required.\n\n2. **Licensing Requirements**: SpaceX must obtain and modify its vehicle operator licenses from the FAA, which involves a thorough review of public safety, national security, insurance requirements, and environmental impact. Any changes to the mission profile or new information submitted by SpaceX can trigger additional reviews and potentially delay licensing approvals.\n\n3. **Coordination with Other Agencies**: The FAA often coordinates with other regulatory agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which can add complexity and time to the approval process. This interagency review can slow down the licensing determination and impact the timeline for future flights.\n\nWhile these issues have caused delays, the recent successful catch of the Super Heavy booster during Starship Flight 5 and the FAA's approval for Flight 5 and Flight 6 missions suggest that SpaceX is making progress despite these regulatory hurdles. However, the ongoing nature of these regulatory processes means that future delays are possible, which could affect the reuse of Starship boosters before 2025.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the ongoing regulatory reviews and the potential for further delays, it is **UNCLEAR** whether these issues will prevent SpaceX from reusing Starship boosters before 2025, but they certainly pose a risk of delaying such activities.",
    "comment": "**(a)** Time left until the outcome is known: **Approximately 63 days** remain until January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n**(b)** What the outcome would be if nothing changed: If nothing changed, the outcome would be **No**; SpaceX would **not** reuse a Starship booster before the deadline.\n\n---\n\n**(c)** What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left: With approximately **16 days** remaining, I would forecast a probability of **2%**.\n\n---\n\n**(d)** What I would forecast if there was 4× the time left: With approximately **252 days** remaining, I would forecast a probability of **25%**.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAs of October 30, 2024, SpaceX has achieved a significant milestone by successfully catching a Super Heavy booster (Booster 12) on October 13, 2024. This marks a crucial step toward the company's goal of full reusability for the Starship system. However, the caught booster is considered outdated and is slated for dissection to gather data rather than being prepared for reuse.\n\n**Technical Challenges:**\n- **Engineering Hurdles:** There are significant technical challenges remaining before SpaceX can reliably reuse Starship boosters. Issues with the Raptor engines, thermal shielding, and structural integrity during re-entry need to be resolved.\n- **Rapid Iteration Cycle:** SpaceX's rapid development cycle means that boosters become obsolete quickly due to continuous design improvements. This reduces the likelihood of reusing current boosters.\n  \n**Operational and Regulatory Factors:**\n- **No Announced Plans:** There are no public announcements or scheduled plans for reusing a Starship booster before January 1, 2025.\n- **Regulatory Delays:** Ongoing regulatory and licensing challenges with agencies like the FAA and EPA could delay test flights and the implementation of booster reuse.\n- **Focus on Data Collection:** The primary focus remains on testing and data collection to refine future versions of Starship, rather than reusing existing hardware.\n\n**Time Constraints:**\n- **Short Timeframe:** With only 63 days remaining, the window for refurbishing a booster, obtaining necessary approvals, and conducting a successful launch is extremely narrow.\n\n**Adjustments Based on Time Remaining:**\n- **With Less Time (Quarter Time):** If there were only about 16 days left, the probability decreases further due to insufficient time for necessary preparations.\n- **With More Time (4× Time):** Extending the timeframe to approximately 252 days increases the probability, as it allows more time to address technical challenges and schedule a reused booster launch.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile SpaceX has made remarkable progress, the combination of technical hurdles, operational focus, and regulatory challenges makes it unlikely that they will reuse a Starship booster before January 1, 2025.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
