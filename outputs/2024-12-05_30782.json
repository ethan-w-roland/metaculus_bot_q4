    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Emmanuel Macron be President of France on December 31, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-05\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Emmanuel Macron is President of France on December 31, 2024. \n\nBACKGROUND:\n[French President Emmanuel Macron says he will NOT resign as crisis engulfs his Government after extremist parties were accused of playing 'Russian roulette' with the country's future](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14154367/french-president-emmanuel-macron-not-resign.html)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether Emmanuel Macron will be the President of France on December 31, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Macron's Current Term\nEmmanuel Macron is currently serving his second term as the President of France, which is set to end in May 2027. He has repeatedly stated his intention to serve out his full term, despite the current political turmoil[1][2][4].\n\n## Political Instability\nThe French government has recently faced significant instability, including the collapse of Prime Minister Michel Barnier's government following a no-confidence vote. However, this does not directly affect Macron's presidency, as the French President is not subject to no-confidence votes in the same way the Prime Minister is[2][4].\n\n## Calls for Resignation\nThere are calls from some parties for Macron to resign due to the ongoing political crisis, but there is no indication that he is inclined to do so. Macron has pledged to continue serving with all his energy until the end of his term[2][4].\n\nGiven these points, it is highly likely that Emmanuel Macron will still be the President of France on December 31, 2024, as there are no immediate mechanisms or indications that would lead to his resignation or removal from office before the end of his term.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant health issues reported for Emmanuel Macron in 2024 that would prevent him from serving as President?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of any significant health issues affecting Emmanuel Macron in 2024 that would prevent him from serving as President.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any scheduled presidential elections in France before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: No, there are no scheduled presidential elections in France before December 31, 2024. The next presidential elections in France are scheduled for April 2027[4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any successful motions of no confidence against Emmanuel Macron's administration before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided source, there has been a successful motion of no confidence against Emmanuel Macron's administration, as it mentions that a no-confidence vote toppled the government on December 5, 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Emmanuel Macron's current presidential term set to last beyond December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Emmanuel Macron's current presidential term is set to last beyond December 31, 2024. His second term as the President of France is scheduled to end in May 2027[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Emmanuel Macron maintained a majority approval rating in national polls throughout 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nEmmanuel Macron's approval rating has consistently been below 50% in various polls throughout 2024. According to the sources, his approval rating has dropped to as low as 23% in some polls[2][5], and even the highest mentioned ratings are well below a majority[1][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Emmanuel Macron experienced any legal charges that could lead to his removal before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of Emmanuel Macron facing any legal charges that could lead to his removal as of December 2024. The sources discuss the political crisis, the no-confidence vote, and the ousting of Prime Minister Michel Barnier, but they do not mention any legal charges against Macron.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Emmanuel Macron announced his resignation as President of France in 2024?\nANSWER: To determine whether Emmanuel Macron has announced his resignation as President of France in 2024, we need to check reliable and up-to-date sources such as news outlets, official statements, or government announcements.\n\nAs of the current date (December 5, 2024), without access to real-time news or specific sources indicating such an announcement, we cannot confirm whether Emmanuel Macron has announced his resignation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Emmanuel Macron been successfully impeached or removed from office before December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe sources indicate that while there have been attempts to initiate impeachment proceedings against Emmanuel Macron, these attempts have not been successful. The first attempt at impeachment failed as the proposal was rejected by the Law Committee and later by the Conference of Group Presidents, and it did not achieve the necessary two-thirds majority in both the National Assembly and the Senate[4][5]. Therefore, as of the current date, Emmanuel Macron has not been successfully impeached or removed from office.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a constitutional provision in France that allows for the removal of the President before the end of their term?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a constitutional provision in France that allows for the removal of the President before the end of their term. This provision is outlined in Article 68 of the French Constitution, which permits the removal of the President by Parliament in cases of a \"breach of duties manifestly incompatible with the exercise of the mandate.\" This process requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the National Assembly and the Senate, as well as a two-thirds majority in a specially convened High Court[2][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Emmanuel Macron have sufficient political support in the French National Assembly to remain President until December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that there has been a significant political development in France, specifically a no-confidence vote that has led to the resignation of the Prime Minister and the toppling of the government. However, the sources do not provide information about whether Emmanuel Macron has sufficient political support in the French National Assembly to remain President until December 31, 2024.\n\nThe role of the President in France is distinct from that of the Prime Minister, and a no-confidence vote against the government does not directly affect the President's term. However, without specific details on the current political support for Macron within the National Assembly, we cannot determine if he has sufficient support to maintain his presidency without any challenges.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nUNCLEAR",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n26 days (from December 5, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf the current situation remains unchanged, Emmanuel Macron would continue to serve as President of France on December 31, 2024.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 7 days remaining, the window for significant changes is limited. In this scenario, the likelihood of Macron remaining President would be very high, around **95%**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith about 104 days until the outcome, there is a larger window for potential political shifts, public opinion changes, or unforeseen events that could impact Macron's presidency. In this extended timeframe, the probability slightly decreases to around **90%**.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nEmmanuel Macron is currently serving his second term, which is constitutionally set to last until May 2027. Despite recent political instability, such as the no-confidence vote and low approval ratings, the French Constitution provides robust mechanisms to remove a sitting president, requiring a two-thirds majority in both legislative houses and a subsequent trial by a High Court. As of December 5, 2024, there have been unsuccessful attempts to impeach Macron, and there is no indication of imminent legal actions that could force his resignation. \n\nThe short timeframe of 26 days before the resolution makes significant political upheaval less likely, especially given the complexity of constitutional processes. Even with a no-confidence vote against the government, the role of the President remains insulated from such political maneuvers unless specific impeachment procedures are successfully initiated and executed. \n\nConsidering these factors, while Macron's low approval ratings and governmental challenges introduce some uncertainty, the structural safeguards in place make his removal improbable within the remaining period. Extending the timeframe would naturally introduce more variables, slightly decreasing the probability but still maintaining a high likelihood of Macron remaining in office.\n\n**Probability: 90%**",
