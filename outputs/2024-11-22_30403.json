    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of Mufasa: The Lion King exceed that of Sonic the Hedgehog 3?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if the domestic box office for the opening weekend of [Mufasa: The Lion King](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt13186482/) surpasses the domestic box office for the opening weekend of [Sonic the Hedgehog 3](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt18259086/), according to the numbers provided by Box Office Mojo. If the domestic box office for the opening weekend of Sonic the Hedgehog 3 exceeds that of Mufasa: The Lion King, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nOther credible sources might be considered if Box Office Mojo does not report the relevant numbers.\n\nThe weekend box office figures are [generally expected](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-by-imdbpro-glossary/GN8HA87MT4597FSW?ref_=mojo_ftr_glossary#weekend) to be posted after 1 PM Pacific Time on the Monday the day after the weekend. This question resolves based on the figures reported when they are accessed by Metaculus Admins, and further revisions will not be considered.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[*Mufasa: The Lion King*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13186482/) is an upcoming American musical drama film directed by Barry Jenkins. It serves as a prequel to the 2019 adaptation of *The Lion King*, which grossed $191 million domestically in its opening weekend, ranking among the top 10 of all time. [*Sonic the Hedgehog 3*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt18259086/) is an upcoming action-adventure comedy film based on the Sega video game series. The original *Sonic the Hedgehog* earned $58 million in its domestic opening weekend, while its sequel, *Sonic the Hedgehog 2*, made $72 million.\n\nBoth films are based in intellectual properties from the early 90s and are set for release on December 20, 2024. Despite the differences in the box office performances of the previous installments in their respective franchises, projections for both films [appear to be similarly strong](https://boxofficetheory.com/5-week-tracking-forecasts-mufasa-the-lion-king-and-sonic-the-hedgehog-3s-early-box-office-ranges-plus-wicked-gladiator-ii-and-moana-2-updates/).\n\nBox Office Mojo generally [defines](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-mojo-by-imdbpro-faq/GCWTV4MQKGWRAUAP#domesticinternational) \"domestic\" as gross box-office revenue from North America (U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico). According to the [Box Office by IMDbPro Glossary](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdbpro/industry-research/box-office-by-imdbpro-glossary/GN8HA87MT4597FSW?ref_=mojo_ftr_glossary#boxofficetracking):\n\n>Box office tracking refers to theatrical box office earnings. Additional sources of revenue, such as home entertainment sales and rentals, television rights, product placement fees, etc. are not included.\n\n>Gross refers to gross earnings in U.S. dollars. On average, a movie's distributor receives a little more than half of the final gross (often referred to as the \"rentals\") with the remainder going to the exhibitor (i.e. movie theater). The money split varies from movie to movie, but, generally, the contract favors the distributor in early weeks and shifts to the exhibitor later on.\n\n>Weekend box office charts show gross receipts for a given weekend, which is Friday through Sunday unless otherwise noted. Studio estimates for the weekend are reported on Sunday mornings, generally between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Pacific Time and reflect estimated Friday and Saturday box office receipts plus a projection for Sunday.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether the domestic opening weekend box office revenue of *Mufasa: The Lion King* will exceed that of *Sonic the Hedgehog 3*, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Release Dates and Competition\nBoth films are scheduled to release on December 20, 2024, which means they will be competing directly for the same audience during the holiday season[1][3][5].\n\n## Box Office Projections\n- *Mufasa: The Lion King* is projected to have a domestic opening weekend in the range of $57 million to $69 million, with a target forecast of $61 million[1].\n- *Sonic the Hedgehog 3* is projected to have a domestic opening weekend in the range of $53 million to $62 million, with a target forecast of $56 million[1].\n\n## Audience and Market Dynamics\n- *Mufasa: The Lion King* benefits from the strong Disney fan base and positive social media sentiment, which could drive family audiences during the holiday season. It is expected to have stronger legs into early 2025 due to less family competition[1].\n- *Sonic the Hedgehog 3* has a front-loaded male fan base, both young and old, which helped the previous films over-perform against expectations. However, its revenue might be more concentrated in the opening weekend[1].\n\n## Current Trends and Forecasts\nGiven the current projections, *Mufasa: The Lion King* has a slightly higher target forecast for its opening weekend compared to *Sonic the Hedgehog 3*. However, the ranges are close, indicating that the outcome could be very competitive[1].\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the current forecasts suggest that *Mufasa: The Lion King* might have a slight edge over *Sonic the Hedgehog 3* in terms of domestic opening weekend box office revenue, the difference is not significant enough to make a definitive prediction. The actual outcome could still vary based on various factors such as final marketing efforts, audience reception, and other market conditions.\n\n### Superforecaster Relevant Details\n- **Base Rates**: Historical performance of prequels and sequels in the holiday season.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The films release on December 20, 2024, so the resolution will be clear within a week.\n- **Current State of the World**: Holiday season dynamics, family audience preferences, and current market trends.\n- **Reference Classes**: Performance of previous films in the *Lion King* and *Sonic the Hedgehog* franchises, especially during holiday releases.\n- **Uncertainty**: The close projections and competitive nature of the releases introduce uncertainty, making it important to monitor final pre-release metrics and audience reactions.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Sonic the Hedgehog 2 gross more than $70 million domestically in its opening weekend?\nANSWER: YES, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 grossed more than $70 million domestically in its opening weekend.

This trend is consistent with previous years, indicating a strong demand for family-friendly content[1].\n\n2. **Holiday Season Releases**: The upcoming holiday season is seeing a major influx of Christmas and holiday movies, many of which are family-friendly. Films like \"Red One\" and \"The Night Before Christmas in Wonderland\" are expected to attract large audiences due to their unique and family-oriented themes[2].\n\n3. **Historical Performance**: The success of family-friendly holiday movies in previous years, as listed in the MovieWeb article, suggests that these films are consistently well-received during the holiday season[3].\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that family-oriented films are generally performing better and are expected to continue this performance during the upcoming holiday season.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the projected domestic opening weekend revenues for Mufasa: The Lion King higher than those for Sonic the Hedgehog 3?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, the projected domestic opening weekend revenues for *Mufasa: The Lion King* are estimated to be between $59 million and $66 million[1].\n\nFor *Sonic the Hedgehog 3*, there is no specific domestic opening weekend revenue projection provided in the sources. However, the sources do indicate that *Mufasa: The Lion King* is expected to perform differently in terms of audience demographics but do not provide a direct comparison of the opening weekend projections for *Sonic the Hedgehog 3*[1][4].\n\nTherefore, without a specific projection for *Sonic the Hedgehog 3*, it is unclear whether the projected domestic opening weekend revenues for *Mufasa: The Lion King* are higher.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n31 days (from November 22, 2024, to December 23, 2024)\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf current projections hold without any unforeseen changes, *Mufasa: The Lion King* is expected to achieve a domestic opening weekend box office revenue of approximately $61 million, while *Sonic the Hedgehog 3* is projected to reach around $56 million. Therefore, the outcome would be **Yes**—*Mufasa: The Lion King* exceeding *Sonic the Hedgehog 3*.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith approximately 8 days remaining, the projections remain relatively stable given the proximity to the release date. Early marketing momentum and existing projections suggest a similar likelihood, though minor fluctuations in audience reception could slightly adjust expectations. Forecast remains cautiously optimistic for **Yes** with a probability around 55%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nWith around 124 days remaining, there's ample time for additional factors such as changes in marketing strategies, unforeseen competition, or shifts in audience sentiment to influence the outcome. Historical data on similar releases indicates a slight advantage for family-oriented films during the holiday season, but market dynamics can introduce variability. Forecast would lean towards **Yes** with a probability of approximately 60%.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe projections for both films are closely aligned, with *Mufasa: The Lion King* having a slightly higher target forecast. The overlap in projected revenue ranges ($57M-$69M for *Mufasa* vs. $53M-$62M for *Sonic*) suggests a competitive opening weekend. The strong Disney brand and positive social media sentiment favor *Mufasa*, especially during the family-centric holiday season. However, *Sonic the Hedgehog 3* benefits from a dedicated fan base and consistent historical performance. Given the narrow margins and inherent uncertainties in box office predictions, especially with overlapping projections and potential market shifts, a balanced probability estimate is warranted.\n\n**Probability: 60%**",
