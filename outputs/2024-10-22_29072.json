{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-22\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System\u2019s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of North Korea conducting a nuclear test before January 1, 2025, here are some key points and context that can inform this prediction:\n\n## Recent Activities and Threats\nNorth Korea has been increasingly active in its nuclear and missile programs. In recent years, the country has conducted several missile launches, including tests of mobile ICBMs and solid-propellant ICBMs, which enhance their prelaunch survivability and reduce launch times.\n\n## Nuclear Capabilities and Doctrine\nNorth Korea has abandoned its no-first-use policy and is developing tactical nuclear weapons, which suggests a more aggressive nuclear posture. The country is estimated to have produced enough fissile material for up to 90 nuclear warheads, although the actual number assembled is likely lower, around 50.\n\n## Threats and Public Statements\nKim Jong Un has recently made threats to use nuclear weapons against South Korea and the United States, particularly in the context of the upcoming U.S. presidential election. He has ordered his military to be ready to \"thoroughly annihilate\" the U.S. and South Korea if provoked.\n\n## Historical Context and Patterns\nNorth Korea has a history of conducting provocative actions, including nuclear tests, to coincide with significant events or to gain leverage in diplomatic negotiations. For example, there is speculation that North Korea might wait until after the U.S. election to take significant actions, similar to past strategies.\n\n## Current Strategic Posture\nThe U.S. Intelligence Community has highlighted that North Korea is likely to continue using nuclear threats and possibly limited military force to achieve political objectives. This includes the possibility of nuclear use in scenarios where North Korea feels its leadership or command and control structures are under threat.\n\n## Base Rates and Trends\nNorth Korea has conducted six nuclear tests since 2006, with the most recent tests showing significant advancements in their nuclear capabilities. Given the ongoing development and modernization of their nuclear arsenal, it is plausible that they might conduct another test to demonstrate their capabilities or in response to perceived threats.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is impossible to predict with certainty whether North Korea will conduct a nuclear test before January 1, 2025, several factors suggest that the likelihood is not negligible:\n- Recent aggressive rhetoric and actions\n- Ongoing advancements in nuclear and missile technologies\n- Historical patterns of provocative behavior\n- The strategic importance of demonstrating nuclear capabilities\n\nHowever, the exact timing and decision to conduct a test depend on various factors, including internal North Korean politics, external pressures, and strategic calculations. Therefore, the answer to whether North Korea will test a nuclear weapon before January 1, 2025, cannot be definitively answered as a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" without further specific intelligence or events.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has North Korea conducted any nuclear tests since 2017?\nANSWER: No, North Korea has not conducted any nuclear tests since 2017. The most recent nuclear test by North Korea was on September 3, 2017, at the Punggye-ri test site. Since then, there have been indications of preparations for potential future tests, but no actual tests have been conducted.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there recent intelligence assessments indicating North Korea plans to conduct a nuclear test soon?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are indications that North Korea has threatened to conduct a nuclear test, but there is no definitive confirmation of an imminent plan.\n\n- The 2024 Annual Threat Assessment (ATA) mentions that \"North Korea continues to threaten to conduct a seventh nuclear test\".\n- However, these sources do not provide a specific timeline or confirmation that the test is planned to occur soon.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence suggesting North Korea is preparing to conduct a nuclear test before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence suggesting that North Korea is preparing to conduct a nuclear test before January 1, 2025, specifically. However, there are indications of potential plans for a nuclear test in the near future.\n\n- A source from September 2024 suggests that North Korea may conduct its seventh nuclear test after the U.S. presidential election in November, which would be before January 1, 2025.\n\nGiven this information, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has North Korea recently increased its rhetoric or threats related to nuclear weapons?\nANSWER: YES\n\nNorth Korea has recently increased its rhetoric and threats related to nuclear weapons. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- Kim Jong Un issued a stark warning that North Korea would not hesitate to unleash its military might, including nuclear weapons, if any adversary attempts to use force against Pyongyang.\n- North Korea\u2019s leader repeated a conditional warning about nuclear use in his speech at the University of National Defense on October 7, emphasizing that North Korea would use all its striking forces, including nuclear weapons, if South Korea violates its sovereignty.\n- There has been an escalation in rhetoric, with Kim Jong Un describing South Korea as a \"foreign country and an apparent hostile country\" and warning of potential retaliation, including the use of nuclear weapons.\n- North Korea has also highlighted its nuclear capabilities through public displays, such as Kim Jong Un's visit to a uranium enrichment facility, and by testing tactical ballistic missiles capable of carrying massive warheads.\n\nThese actions and statements indicate a significant increase in nuclear-related rhetoric and threats from North Korea.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has North Korea's leadership made public statements about resuming nuclear testing?\nANSWER: Yes, North Korea's leadership has made public statements that imply a readiness to resume nuclear testing or enhance their nuclear capabilities.\n\n- In a statement, Kim Jong Un vowed to make his nuclear force fully ready for combat, and there are speculations among analysts that North Korea might conduct nuclear tests or test-launch intercontinental ballistic missiles to enhance its bargaining position in future diplomatic engagements.\n- Kim Yo Jong, the sister of Kim Jong Un, described U.S. calls for diplomacy as \"preposterous\" and indicated that North Korea would not give up its nuclear weapons, suggesting a continued commitment to its nuclear program.\n- Additionally, Kim Jong Un has stated that North Korea would use nuclear weapons \"without hesitation\" if attacked, which underscores the country's resolve to maintain and potentially expand its nuclear capabilities.\n\nThese statements collectively indicate that North Korea's leadership is prepared to continue and possibly escalate their nuclear activities.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been recent diplomatic engagement between North Korea and other countries regarding its nuclear program?\nANSWER: The recent diplomatic landscape regarding North Korea's nuclear program indicates a lack of significant diplomatic engagement. Here are the key points:\n\n- Since 2019, there has been a notable absence of meaningful diplomatic dialogue between the U.S. and North Korea. The last significant talks broke down, and North Korea has since refused to resume negotiations unless the U.S. takes substantial steps to end what it calls \"hostile\" policies, such as sanctions and military exercises with South Korea.\n- The Biden administration has expressed a willingness to restart talks without preconditions, but Pyongyang has not shown interest.\n- Recent developments include North Korea's increased missile tests and its strengthening of military cooperation with Russia, as seen in the June 2024 Kim-Putin summit, which further indicates a lack of engagement on the nuclear issue.\n- There has been no recent joint statement or agreement between North Korea and other countries specifically addressing its nuclear program.\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that there has been no recent significant diplomatic engagement regarding North Korea's nuclear program.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have international sanctions against North Korea been strengthened or relaxed recently?\nANSWER: The recent developments indicate that the international sanctions regime against North Korea has not been strengthened and may have been relaxed in some aspects.\n\n- Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution to extend the mandate of the panel of experts that monitored the implementation of UN sanctions on North Korea, effectively ending this monitoring mechanism as of April 30, 2024.\n- This move has been criticized by other countries, including the United States, France, Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, who argue that it makes it easier for North Korea to pursue nuclear weapons and other unlawful activities with a sense of impunity.\n\nWhile the United States is exploring alternative mechanisms to monitor sanctions enforcement, the current absence of the panel of experts suggests a relaxation in the monitoring and enforcement of these sanctions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**, international sanctions against North Korea have not been strengthened recently; instead, they may have been relaxed due to the lack of a monitoring mechanism.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there reports of increased activity at North Korean nuclear test sites?\nANSWER: Yes, there are reports of increased activity at North Korean nuclear test sites, although it does not necessarily indicate imminent preparations for a nuclear test.\n\n- Recent satellite images show activity at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility, including maintenance at the Main Administration and Support Area, the Yongam-dong Command Center Area, and the Kuok-tong Support Compound. This activity is largely related to routine caretaker maintenance and the ongoing maintenance of Tunnel No. 3, which has been prepared for a potential seventh nuclear test.\n\n- Despite this activity, it is noted that the recent observations do not suggest imminent preparations for a seventh nuclear test.\n\n- Additionally, there have been reports of renovations and preparations at the Punggye-ri test site since early 2022, and the IAEA has noted that the site was reopened in September 2022.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has North Korea developed new nuclear technologies or capabilities since its last test?\nANSWER: Yes, North Korea has developed new nuclear technologies and capabilities since its last nuclear test in 2017.\n\n- North Korea has continued to modernize and expand its nuclear arsenal, including the development of new missile technologies such as solid-fuel missiles, which improve the survivability and mobility of its missile force.\n- There has been significant progress in the development of tactical nuclear weapons, including the Hwasan-31, a new miniaturized warhead nicknamed the \"olive,\" which is designed for short-range missiles.\n- North Korea has ramped up its uranium enrichment activities, with Kim Jong Un calling for an exponential increase in the number of nuclear weapons. This includes the introduction of new, advanced centrifuges that could significantly increase the production of highly enriched uranium.\n- The country has also tested various new missiles, including the Hwasong-18, a solid-fuel missile with a potentially long range, and other missiles capable of reaching the US mainland and other distant targets.\n\nThese developments indicate that North Korea has been actively enhancing its nuclear capabilities and technologies since the last nuclear test.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has North Korea's internal political situation changed in a way that might influence a decision to test a nuclear weapon?\nANSWER: Yes, North Korea's internal political situation has undergone significant changes that could influence its decision to test a nuclear weapon.\n\n1. **Policy Shifts and Hostility**: North Korea has recently adopted a more hostile stance towards South Korea, framing ties as those between \"two belligerent states\" and emphasizing the potential use of nuclear weapons. This shift includes renouncing the \"One Korea Policy\" and redefining itself as an independent socialist state, which indicates a hardened stance that could lead to increased nuclear activities.\n\n2. **Economic and Internal Stability**: The regime is facing deepening economic malaise, including food and energy shortages, and a breakdown in the state rationing system. This economic strain, combined with the weakening of decades-long indoctrination and loyalty within the party and military, could lead Kim Jong-un to use nuclear tests as a means to consolidate power and distract from internal issues.\n\n3. **Nuclear Doctrine**: In September 2022, North Korea passed a new nuclear law stating that it will never engage in denuclearization talks and will \"never give up\" nuclear weapons. This, along with calls for an \"exponential increase\" in the nuclear arsenal, suggests a strong commitment to nuclear development and potential testing.\n\n4. **Regime Survival**: The Kim Jong-un regime's survival strategy increasingly relies on militarization and the development of nuclear and missile capabilities. Given the internal threats and economic challenges, the regime might see nuclear tests as a way to demonstrate strength and ensure regime stability.\n\nThese factors collectively indicate that North Korea's internal political situation has indeed changed in ways that could influence a decision to test a nuclear weapon.", "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nThere are approximately **71 days** left until January 1, 2025.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed, North Korea **would not** test a nuclear weapon before January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith about **18 days** left, I would forecast a **lower probability** of a nuclear test occurring before the deadline.\n\n**(d) What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nWith approximately **284 days** left (extending the deadline to around August 2025), I would forecast a **higher probability** of a nuclear test occurring before the extended deadline.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**1. Historical Base Rates:**\n\n- **Frequency of Nuclear Tests:** North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017, roughly one every 1.8 years during active periods. However, there has been a **seven-year hiatus** since the last test in 2017.\n  \n- **Pattern of Testing:** Historically, North Korea's nuclear tests have often been spaced out, with the shortest gap being eight months and the longest being three years.\n\n**2. Recent Activities and Threats:**\n\n- **Missile Tests:** There has been a significant increase in missile testing, including advanced missiles like solid-propellant ICBMs, which enhance prelaunch survivability.\n  \n- **Rhetoric and Threats:** Kim Jong Un has intensified rhetoric, threatening to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. and South Korea if provoked.\n\n**3. Intelligence Assessments:**\n\n- **Preparations at Test Sites:** Satellite imagery shows activity at the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility, particularly at Tunnel No. 3, which is prepared for potential testing. However, recent activities suggest routine maintenance rather than imminent testing.\n\n- **Intelligence Reports:** U.S. and South Korean intelligence have indicated potential preparations for a seventh nuclear test but lack confirmation of an imminent test.\n\n**4. Strategic Timing Considerations:**\n\n- **U.S. Presidential Election:** North Korea may avoid significant provocations until after the U.S. presidential election to assess the international response and adjust its strategies accordingly.\n\n- **Diplomatic Leverage:** North Korea uses nuclear tests as leverage in international negotiations. Conducting a test may depend on strategic benefits outweighing the risks.\n\n**5. International Environment:**\n\n- **Sanctions Enforcement:** Russia's veto of the UN Security Council resolution to extend sanctions monitoring weakens international oversight, potentially emboldening North Korea.\n\n- **Relations with China and Russia:** Strengthened ties may reduce North Korea's concern about international backlash.\n\n**6. Domestic Factors:**\n\n- **Economic Challenges:** Internal economic difficulties could push the regime to showcase strength through a nuclear test, though it risks further sanctions.\n\n- **Political Stability:** Consolidating internal power may motivate displays of military might.\n\n**7. Countervailing Factors:**\n\n- **International Backlash:** A nuclear test would likely result in increased sanctions and international isolation, which North Korea may want to avoid amid economic hardships.\n\n- **Lack of Diplomatic Engagement:** Without ongoing negotiations, North Korea might not see immediate benefit in testing.\n\n**8. Timeframe Considerations:**\n\n- **Short Time Left:** With only about two months remaining, the window for conducting a test is limited.\n\n- **Weather Conditions:** Winter conditions could complicate test preparations and logistics.\n\n**Forecast Adjustments Based on Timeframe:**\n\n- **Quarter of the Time Left (~18 days):** Probability decreases due to even less time for preparations and strategic benefits.\n\n- **4x the Time Left (~284 days):** Probability increases as there is more time for strategic shifts, international developments, or internal motivations to culminate in a test.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the above factors, while there is a possibility of North Korea conducting a nuclear test before January 1, 2025, the limited time frame and lack of definitive indicators make it less likely. The aggressive rhetoric and ongoing developments suggest preparedness but do not confirm imminent action within the short remaining period.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 20%**", "probability": 20}
