    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill any of the Waltons be worth $100 billion or more on December 31, 2024, according to Forbes?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-20\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to the [Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#482980403d78) on December 31, 2024 Jim Walton & Family, Alice Walton, or Rob Walton & Family are worth greater than or equal to $100 billion. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nIf the resolution source is unavailable at the resolution time, resolution will wait until it is available (at which point it resolves based on the data shown), until January 6, 2025, at which point this question will be **annulled**. For more details on various edge cases regarding availability of or changes to the resolution source, please see Metaculus's ambiguity and annulment policies [here](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#ambiguous-annulled).  \n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the resolution source: \"Forbes' Real-Time Billionaires rankings tracks the daily ups and downs of the world’s richest people. The wealth-tracking platform provides ongoing updates on the net worth and ranking of each individual confirmed by Forbes to be a billionaire. The value of individuals’ public holdings are updated every 5 minutes when respective stock markets are open (there will be a 15-minute delay for stock prices). Individuals whose fortunes are significantly tied to private companies will have their net worths updated once a day. In cases where an individual owns a stake in a private company that accounts for 20% or more of his or her net worth, the value of the company will be adjusted according to an industry- or region-specific market index provided by our partners at FactSet Research Systems when available. A rotating cast of the five biggest winners and losers throughout the day is featured at the top of the page, followed by the complete list of billionaires ranked in order of net worth.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether any of the Waltons will be worth $100 billion or more by December 31, 2024, according to Forbes, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Wealth\nAs of August 2024, the Walton family's net worth is estimated to be around $347 billion, with the individual members' wealth broken down as follows:\n- Jim Walton: $95.7 billion\n- S. Robson Walton: $94 billion\n- Alice Walton: $88.9 billion\n- Lukas Walton: $33.8 billion\n- Christy Walton: $16.4 billion\n- Nancy Walton Laurie: $12.7 billion\n- Ann Walton Kroenke: $11.5 billion[4].\n\n## Recent Trends\nThe Walton family's wealth has been increasing over the years, driven primarily by the performance of Walmart, the world's largest retailer. However, the rate of increase can vary based on market conditions, company performance, and other economic factors[3][4].\n\n## Time Frame\nGiven that the query is about the wealth of the Waltons by December 31, 2024, and considering the current wealth figures are from August 2024, there is a relatively short period for significant changes to occur.\n\n## Base Rates and Historical Context\nHistorically, the wealth of the Walton family has grown steadily, but it is rare for individual family members to see their wealth increase by more than $5-10 billion in a few months. However, market fluctuations and other economic factors can influence this[2][3].\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the current figures and historical trends, it is unlikely but not impossible that any of the Waltons will reach a net worth of $100 billion or more by December 31, 2024. The current closest members, Jim and Robson Walton, would need to see a significant increase in their wealth, which would be unusual in such a short time frame.\n\nTherefore, while it cannot be ruled out entirely, the likelihood of any Walton reaching $100 billion or more by the end of 2024 appears low based on current data.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have any of the Waltons acquired additional assets or investments worth $5 billion or more since August 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of the Waltons acquiring additional assets or investments worth $5 billion or more since August 2024. The sources discuss various real estate acquisitions and investments in Bella Vista, but none of these transactions approach the $5 billion threshold.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Walmart engaged in any mergers or acquisitions worth over $5 billion since August 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no evidence of Walmart engaging in any mergers or acquisitions worth over $5 billion since August 2024.\n\nThe most recent acquisition mentioned is Walmart's acquisition of VIZIO, which was announced in February 2024 and valued at $2.3 billion, well below the $5 billion threshold[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Jim Walton's net worth at least $95 billion as of August 2024?\nANSWER: As of August 2024, Jim Walton's net worth was more than $95 billion. Here are the relevant details:\n\n- In August 2024, Jim Walton's net worth was reported to be $92.4 billion after a significant gain[4].\n- However, by September 2024, his net worth had surged to over $100 billion due to a further rise in Walmart's stock price[1].\n\nGiven this information, it is clear that by August 2024, his net worth was already approaching or had exceeded $95 billion.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Rob Walton's net worth at least $94 billion as of August 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, Rob Walton's net worth was at least $94 billion as of August 2024. According to the sources, Rob Walton's net worth was estimated to be around $94 billion at that time[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Alice Walton's net worth at least $88.9 billion as of August 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, as of August 2024, Alice Walton's net worth is estimated to be significantly higher than $88.9 billion.\n\n- According to Fortune, her net worth has grown to $101 billion, making her the richest woman on the planet[1].\n- The IB Times also reports that her net worth has soared to $95 billion, but this figure is from before the latest increase reported by Fortune[3].\n- Another source mentions her net worth surging to a range of $73 billion to $95 billion, but again, this is before the latest updates[2].\n\nGiven these updates, her net worth is indeed at least $88.9 billion as of August 2024.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the global economy grown by at least 3% in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the answer to whether the global economy has grown by at least 3% in 2024 is unclear because the forecasts vary across different organizations.\n\n- The UN report forecasts global GDP growth to decelerate to 2.4% in 2024[1].\n- The OECD projects steady global GDP growth of 3.1% in 2024[2].\n- The IMF forecasts global GDP growth at 3.2% for 2024[3].\n- The World Bank projects global growth to hold steady at 2.6% in 2024[5].\n\nGiven these different projections, it is not possible to definitively say that the global economy has grown by at least 3% in 2024 based on the available sources.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Walmart reported higher-than-expected earnings in the past four quarters of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, it is clear that Walmart has reported strong earnings performance in the quarters of 2024 that have been discussed.\n\n- For the third quarter of FY2025 (which is part of 2024), Walmart reported strong revenue growth of 5.5% and operating income growth of 8.2%, with earnings surpassing expectations[1][3][4].\n- For the second quarter of FY2025 (also in 2024), Walmart delivered another strong quarter with global eCommerce sales growing 32% and the company executing well on its strategy[2].\n\nGiven that the latest earnings reports mentioned in the sources indicate that Walmart has consistently beaten expectations, it can be inferred that Walmart has reported higher-than-expected earnings in the past four quarters of 2024.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Walmart's stock price increased by at least 10% between August 2024 and December 31, 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if Walmart's stock price has increased by at least 10% between August 2024 and December 31, 2024, we need to compare the stock prices for these two periods.\n\n## August 2024:\nThe closing price for Walmart on August 30, 2024, was $77.23[4].\n\n## December 2024:\nAs of November 19, 2024, the closing price for Walmart was $87.42[3]. Since the question asks about the period up to December 31, 2024, and given that the price as of November 19 is already higher than the August price, we can use this data to make an assessment.\n\n## Calculation:\n- August 30, 2024: $77.23\n- November 19, 2024: $87.42\n\nThe percentage increase is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{87.42 - 77.23}{77.23} \\right) \\times 100\\% \\approx 13.2\\%\n\\]\n\nSince the stock price has increased by more than 10% between August 2024 and November 2024, and given that the question includes up to December 31, 2024, it is clear that the increase is sufficient to meet the 10% threshold.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the retail market performing better than in previous years, positively impacting Walmart's valuation?\nANSWER: The current performance of the retail market and its impact on a specific company like Walmart is complex and can be analyzed from several angles based on the provided sources.\n\n## Retail Market Performance\n- Retail sales have maintained solid momentum, with a 0.4% increase in October 2024, driven by purchases of autos, electronics, and dining out[2].\n- However, the growth in retail sales has slowed down from 5.5% year-over-year in December 2023 to 2.8% year-over-year in October 2024[2].\n- Despite this, the overall consumer spending remains on track for solid growth, with a forecasted 3% rise in retail sales for the November and December 2024 holiday season, although this growth will be largely price-driven[2].\n- The retail market fundamentals have strengthened, with record-low availability rates and strong rent growth, but rent growth is expected to moderate due to a slowdown in consumer spending and inflation[3].\n\n## Impact on Retailers\n- Retailers that have adopted AI and ML solutions have seen significant growth in sales and profits compared to those that have not[1].\n- There is an optimistic outlook for retailers who can effectively navigate the changing market terrain, particularly those leveraging technology like AI to enhance operations and customer experiences[4].\n\n## Specific to Walmart\n- While the sources provide general trends and outlooks for the retail industry, they do not specifically address Walmart's valuation or performance.\n- The performance of Walmart would depend on various factors including its own strategies, market position, and how it adapts to the broader retail trends.\n\nGiven the information, it is unclear whether the retail market's performance is positively impacting Walmart's valuation specifically, as the sources do not provide data or analysis directly related to Walmart.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any negative event such as a major lawsuit or scandal affecting Walmart since August 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several negative events affecting Walmart since August 2024:\n\n1. **Disability Discrimination Lawsuit**: Walmart agreed to pay $175,000 to settle three EEOC disability discrimination suits, which involved allegations of failing to accommodate employee disabilities and firing employees due to their disabilities[1].\n\n2. **Opioid-Related Duty of Oversight Derivative Suit**: A shareholder derivative lawsuit related to Walmart's handling of opioid-related issues was settled for $123 million in October 2024[3].\n\n3. **California Lawsuit Over Illegal Dumping of Hazardous Waste**: Walmart agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by California officials alleging the company illegally dumped hazardous waste in municipal landfills throughout the state. This settlement was announced in October 2024[5].\n\n4. **Class Action Lawsuit Over Weighted Groceries**: Although the lawsuit itself began earlier, the final approval for a $45 million class action settlement regarding weighted groceries was granted in June 2024, but the settlement and its implications would still be relevant and ongoing since then[4].\n\nThese events all occurred or were finalized after August 2024.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n41 days (from November 20, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nYes. As of September 2024, Jim Walton's net worth surged to over $100 billion. If nothing changes, he remains above the $100 billion threshold by December 31, 2024.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nYes. With only 10 days remaining, Jim Walton's net worth has already surpassed $100 billion, leaving little room for fluctuation that would bring it below the threshold.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nYes. Extending the timeframe further would not affect the outcome since Jim Walton has already exceeded the $100 billion mark as of September 2024.\n\n**Rationale:**\nBased on the provided information, Jim Walton's net worth exceeded $100 billion in September 2024 due to a significant rise in Walmart's stock price. Since the question's resolution date is December 31, 2024, and there have been no indications of a decline that would reduce his net worth below $100 billion within the remaining period, the probability that any of the Waltons will be worth $100 billion or more remains certain.\n\n**Probability: 100%**",
