    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Alaska voters approve Alaska Ballot Measure 2, which would repeal ranked-choice voting and nonpartisan primaries in the state?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-30\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if [Alaska Ballot Measure 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Alaska_Ballot_Measure_2) is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Alaska Ballot Measure 2, Repeal Top-Four Ranked-Choice Voting Initiative (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Alaska_Ballot_Measure_2,_Repeal_Top-Four_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Initiative_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo predict whether Alaska voters will approve Alaska Ballot Measure 2, which aims to repeal the top-four ranked-choice voting and nonpartisan primaries, here are some key points and background information that could influence the decision:\n\n## Previous Voting Patterns\n- The original measure to implement ranked-choice voting and nonpartisan primaries (Ballot Measure 2 in 2020) was approved by a narrow margin of 50.55% to 49.45%.\n- This close margin indicates that opinions on the electoral system are highly divided.\n\n## Current Sentiment and Arguments\n- Proponents of the repeal argue that the current system is confusing, overly complicated, and vulnerable to manipulation. They point to issues such as voter confusion and the disqualification of ballots in the 2022 special congressional election.\n- Opponents argue that the current system is more inclusive, allows for better representation of moderate candidates, and can lead to higher voter turnout and engagement.\n\n## Recent Polling\n- A poll conducted by Alaska Survey Research in January 2023 showed 53% of respondents in favor of the repeal and 47% against, with a margin of error of Â±3.0%.\n\n## Legal and Administrative Aspects\n- The Alaska Supreme Court has cleared the way for the repeal measure to be on the ballot, resolving a lawsuit challenging the signature collection process.\n\n## Base Rates and Historical Context\n- The 2020 measure was supported by significant outside funding, which could influence public perception and trust in the system.\n- The first implementation of the new system in the 2022 elections led to mixed results, including the election of a Democrat in a traditionally Republican district due to vote splitting among Republican candidates.\n\n## Endorsements and Public Figures\n- The initiative has received endorsements from some state senators and other public figures, while opponents include various groups and individuals who argue for the benefits of the current system.\n\nGiven these points, the outcome of the vote is not immediately clear. The close margin in the 2020 vote, the divided public opinion, and the recent polling data all suggest that the result could go either way. Here are some key factors for superforecasters to consider:\n\n- **Public Perception of Complexity**: How voters perceive the complexity of the ranked-choice voting system could significantly influence their decision.\n- **Recent Election Outcomes**: The impact of the 2022 special election and other recent elections under the new system may sway voters' opinions.\n- **Funding and Endorsements**: The influence of outside funding and endorsements from public figures could affect voter sentiment.\n- **Legal and Administrative Issues**: Any lingering concerns about the legitimacy of the signature collection process might impact voter trust.\n\nThese factors highlight the need for careful consideration of multiple variables to make an informed prediction.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there recent polling indicating that a majority of Alaska voters support the repeal of ranked-choice voting?\nANSWER: There is no recent polling data provided in the sources to indicate whether a majority of Alaska voters support the repeal of ranked-choice voting. The sources discuss the details of the ballot measure, the supporters and opponents, and the legal challenges, but they do not include any specific polling results.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major political parties or influential groups in Alaska actively campaigning for the repeal of ranked-choice voting?\nANSWER: YES, major political parties and influential groups in Alaska are actively campaigning for the repeal of ranked-choice voting.\n\n- Proponents of the repeal, including organizations like Alaskans for Honest Elections, are actively campaigning against ranked-choice voting. This group has received support from notable figures such as Sarah Palin, who has been a vocal critic of the system.\n- Some Republicans in Alaska have also turned against the ranked-choice voting system, particularly after losses in recent elections, such as Sarah Palin's loss to Peltola in 2022.\n\nThese efforts indicate active campaigning by influential groups and individuals to repeal the ranked-choice voting system.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there substantial financial contributions supporting the repeal of ranked-choice voting in Alaska?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the financial contributions supporting the repeal of ranked-choice voting in Alaska are not substantial compared to those supporting the retention of the current voting system.\n\nThe repeal campaign has raised just over $61,000 by late August, with the top donors including David Cruz, Thomas Dunham, and Earhart Roofing, each contributing relatively small amounts.\n\nIn contrast, the groups supporting the retention of ranked-choice voting have raised significantly more, with totals approaching $4.8 million from various donors and organizations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**, there are not substantial financial contributions supporting the repeal of ranked-choice voting in Alaska.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do historical trends show that Alaska voters often overturn recent election reforms?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear historical trend indicating that Alaska voters often overturn recent election reforms. The current effort to repeal the ranked-choice voting and open primary system, which was adopted in 2020 and first used in 2022, is a specific instance and not part of a broader historical pattern.\n\nThe sources discuss the recent adoption and implementation of the new election system and the ongoing efforts to repeal it, but they do not provide evidence of frequent reversals of election reforms in Alaska's history.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a national trend of states repealing or rejecting ranked-choice voting systems?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear if there is a national trend of states repealing or rejecting ranked-choice voting systems.\n\nWhile it is true that several states are considering measures to adopt or reject ranked-choice voting (RCV), the current landscape is mixed:\n- Alaska is voting on a measure to repeal its ranked-choice voting system, which was adopted in 2020.\n- Missouri is considering a constitutional amendment to ban ranked-choice voting.\n- However, other states like Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, D.C., are voting on propositions to adopt ranked-choice voting.\n\nAdditionally, some states have recently banned ranked-choice voting, but this does not necessarily indicate a widespread national trend, as the adoption and rejection of RCV are highly varied and influenced by local and state-specific factors.\n\nTherefore, the evidence does not conclusively indicate a national trend of states repealing or rejecting ranked-choice voting systems.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant media coverage in Alaska criticizing ranked-choice voting?\nANSWER: Yes, there is significant media coverage in Alaska criticizing ranked-choice voting.\n\nSeveral sources highlight the criticisms and controversies surrounding ranked-choice voting in Alaska. For example:\n\n- Critics, including Republicans and some Democrats, argue that the system is intricate, disadvantages certain factions within political parties, and can lead to voter confusion and increased costs.\n- The system has been criticized for potentially favoring moderation over conservative or progressive voices and for the influence of dark money and outside donors.\n- There are reports of strong grassroots opposition to the system, with groups like Alaskans for Honest Elections leading the effort to repeal it, which has garnered significant support and media attention.\n- High-profile figures, including former Governor Sarah Palin and Senator Tom Cotton, have publicly criticized the system, labeling it as confusing and potentially rigged.\n\nThese criticisms are widely discussed in various media outlets and public debates, indicating significant media coverage of the criticisms.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has voter turnout in Alaska decreased since the adoption of ranked-choice voting?\nANSWER: The impact of ranked-choice voting (RCV) on voter turnout in Alaska is not clear-cut and depends on the metrics and context used.\n\n- Some sources indicate that Alaska saw its lowest voter turnout in any general election since 1980 in 2022, which is the first year RCV was implemented. This suggests a decrease in voter turnout.\n- However, other analyses argue that the decrease in turnout is not uniquely attributable to RCV. For example, turnout in the 2022 general election was similar to historical midterm election turnout, and the drop in turnout was comparable to the national trend, which did not use RCV.\n- Additionally, there are conflicting views on whether the new election system itself was the primary cause of the turnout drop. Factors such as voter fatigue, candidate behavior, and changes in election procedures are also considered significant.\n\nGiven these mixed findings and the lack of consensus on whether RCV was the primary cause of the observed changes in voter turnout, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has ranked-choice voting in Alaska led to controversial election outcomes that might influence public opinion against it?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nRanked-choice voting in Alaska has indeed led to controversial election outcomes that have influenced public opinion against it. Here are some key points:\n\n- The 2022 Alaska special election, where Democrat Mary Peltola won despite Republican candidates receiving more initial votes, has been cited as an example of how ranked-choice voting can lead to outcomes that do not reflect the initial preferences of the majority of voters. This has led to criticisms that the system can favor extreme candidates over more moderate ones.\n\n- The complexity of the system has resulted in significant voter confusion, with 11% of ballots being 'spoiled' due to errors, such as voters selecting only one candidate without ranking others. This high rate of spoiled ballots has contributed to public dissatisfaction.\n\n- The system has also been criticized for leading to delayed election results and unpredictable outcomes, further eroding voter confidence. For instance, the Alaskan special election took over two weeks to determine the outcome.\n\n- Public opinion is divided, with some voters and political figures expressing frustration and disillusionment with the system. This is evident from the ongoing legal fight and the initiative to repeal ranked-choice voting in Alaska, which has secured enough signatures to be on the November ballot.\n\nThese issues have collectively contributed to a significant amount of controversy surrounding ranked-choice voting in Alaska, influencing public opinion against it.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the repeal of ranked-choice voting endorsed by prominent Alaskan political figures?\nANSWER: The endorsement of the repeal of ranked-choice voting by prominent Alaskan political figures is mixed and depends on the individual.\n\n### Endorsements for Repeal:\n- Sarah Palin, the former Republican governor, is a prominent figure who has spoken out against ranked-choice voting. She has characterized it as \"crazy, convoluted, confusing\" and has supported the initiative to repeal it.\n- Phil Izon, the lead organizer of Alaskans for Honest Elections, is also a notable figure advocating for the repeal of ranked-choice voting.\n\n### Opposition to Repeal:\n- On the other hand, there are also prominent figures who oppose the repeal. For example, Bryan Schroder, the former U.S. attorney for the District of Alaska, argues that Alaska's ranked-choice voting system is good public policy and gives a voice to the majority of Alaskans who are not at either end of the political extremes.\n- Mary Peltola, who won a U.S. House seat using the ranked-choice voting system, has praised it and endorsed its continuation.\n\nGiven this mixed support, it is clear that not all prominent Alaskan political figures endorse the repeal of ranked-choice voting.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the implementation of ranked-choice voting in Alaska result in significant voter confusion or administrative problems?\nANSWER: The implementation of ranked-choice voting in Alaska has been associated with some concerns and issues, but the evidence is mixed regarding the extent of voter confusion and administrative problems.\n\n### Voter Confusion\n- Critics of the system argue that it can be confusing for voters. For example, Phil Izon, a leader of the repeal effort, cited his grandfather's confusion as a reason for starting the repeal initiative.\n- However, polling data suggests that a majority of voters do not find the system confusing. A poll found that 79% of Alaska voters surveyed said using a ranked-choice voting ballot was âsimple,â and 85% of Alaskans reported that ranked-choice voting was âsimpleâ.\n\n### Administrative Problems\n- There have been issues with ballots being disqualified or exhausted prematurely, particularly in cases where voters only ranked their first choice and did not provide subsequent preferences. For instance, in the 2022 special election for Alaskaâs U.S. House seat, nearly 15,000 ballots were affected, with over 11,000 being disqualified because voters selected only one candidate without ranking any others.\n- Despite these issues, research indicates that ranked ballots do not raise the probability of a voter casting an uncountable vote, and many voters intentionally choose to rank only their top choice.\n\n### Overall Impact\n- The system has been in use since 2022, and while there have been some challenges, such as the need for additional education and the handling of disqualified ballots, the overall administrative process has continued to function. The Alaska Division of Elections has spent $3.5 million on education outreach and election equipment upgrades since 2021.\n\nGiven this mixed evidence, it is not clear that the implementation of ranked-choice voting in Alaska resulted in **significant** voter confusion or administrative problems, although there have been some issues and concerns raised.\n\n**UNCLEAR**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n\nAs of October 30, 2024, there are **6 days** remaining until the general election on **November 5, 2024**, when Alaska voters will decide on Ballot Measure 2.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf current trends and factors remain unchanged, it is likely that **Alaska Ballot Measure 2 would not be approved**. This means ranked-choice voting and nonpartisan primaries would remain in place.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nIf there were only **1.5 days** left until the election, I would forecast with greater confidence that the measure would **not pass**, given the limited time for any significant shifts in public opinion or campaign efforts.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\nIf there were **24 days** remaining until the election, there would be more opportunity for campaigns to influence voters. However, based on current information, I would still forecast that the measure is **unlikely to pass**, but with slightly more uncertainty due to the potential for new developments.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nTo estimate the probability that Alaska voters will approve Ballot Measure 2, I have considered several key factors:\n\n1. **Polling Data:**\n   - The most recent available poll from **January 2023** indicated that **53%** of respondents supported the repeal, while **47%** opposed it, with a margin of error of Â±3%.\n   - However, this poll is outdated, and there is **no recent polling** providing current insights into voter intentions.\n\n2. **Financial Contributions:**\n   - The repeal campaign has raised approximately **$61,000**, which is **significantly less** than the nearly **$4.8 million** raised by groups supporting the retention of ranked-choice voting.\n   - The disparity in funding suggests that the repeal campaign may lack the resources for effective voter outreach and advertising.\n\n3. **Campaign Endorsements and Influential Groups:**\n   - While some prominent figures like **Sarah Palin** support the repeal, endorsements are mixed among Alaska's political leaders.\n   - Organizations and individuals advocating for the benefits of ranked-choice voting are actively campaigning against the repeal.\n\n4. **Voter Experience with Ranked-Choice Voting:**\n   - Since its implementation in 2022, voter familiarity with ranked-choice voting has increased.\n   - Surveys indicate that a majority of voters found the system **simple to use**, with **79%** saying it was straightforward.\n   - While there have been instances of voter confusion and ballot spoilage, these issues may diminish as voters become more accustomed to the system.\n\n5. **Historical Trends:**\n   - There is **no clear historical precedent** of Alaska voters overturning recent election reforms.\n   - The original adoption of ranked-choice voting in 2020 passed by a narrow margin, reflecting a closely divided electorate.\n\n6. **Media Coverage and Public Debate:**\n   - Significant media coverage exists on both sides of the issue, but there is **no overwhelming negative sentiment** against ranked-choice voting.\n   - Public debates and discussions may help inform voters rather than sway them decisively in one direction.\n\n7. **National Context:**\n   - The national landscape regarding ranked-choice voting is mixed, with some states considering adoption and others debating repeal.\n   - There is **no strong national trend** that suggests external influences would significantly impact Alaska voters.\n\n8. **Controversial Election Outcomes:**\n   - Some controversial outcomes, such as the 2022 special congressional election, have been attributed to ranked-choice voting.\n   - However, it is unclear if these instances have swayed public opinion significantly against the system.\n\n9. **Voter Turnout:**\n   - Data on voter turnout since the adoption of ranked-choice voting is mixed, and it is **unclear** whether the system has led to a decrease in turnout.\n   - Turnout fluctuations may be influenced by multiple factors beyond the voting system itself.\n\n10. **Time Remaining Before the Election:**\n    - With only **6 days** left, substantial shifts in public opinion are less likely.\n    - Campaign efforts in the final days may have limited impact due to early and absentee voting already in progress.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nConsidering the lack of recent polling, the significant funding and endorsements supporting the retention of ranked-choice voting, and the increased voter familiarity with the system, it seems **unlikely** that Ballot Measure 2 will be approved by voters.\n\nWhile there is some support for the repeal, particularly among certain political figures and groups, the overall momentum and resources appear to favor maintaining the current system.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 35%**\n\n---\n\nI estimate there is a **35%** chance that Alaska voters will approve Ballot Measure 2, leading to the repeal of ranked-choice voting and nonpartisan primaries.",
