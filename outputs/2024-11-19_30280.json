    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill AMC Theatres file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if  AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before January 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAmid negative operating income and a large debtload (and high interest payments), meme stock AMC has recently [refinanced](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/amc-theatres-refinancing-deal-2029-1235954760/) debt\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of AMC Theatres filing for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Financial Struggles and Debt\nAMC Theatres has been facing significant financial challenges, particularly exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a $917 million cash infusion in 2021 that helped the company avoid bankruptcy at that time, the company continues to struggle with high debt levels and negative cash flow[1][3].\n\n## Current Financial State\nAs of the latest reports, AMC has a high debt load, with $2.89 billion in debt due in 2026. The company is expected to continue burning cash, with estimated operational losses of $150 million to $250 million in both 2024 and 2025[3].\n\n## Management Statements\nIn the latest 10-K filing, AMC's management acknowledged the risk of liquidation or bankruptcy if operating revenues do not normalize and if they are unsuccessful in restructuring their liabilities. This indicates that bankruptcy is still a potential outcome if the company's financial situation does not improve[3].\n\n## Share Issuance and Dilution\nAMC has been issuing a large number of additional shares to raise cash, which has led to significant dilution. This strategy has allowed the company to delay bankruptcy but may not be sustainable indefinitely[3].\n\n## Potential for Bankruptcy\nGiven the ongoing financial struggles, the risk of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is not off the table. A bankruptcy plan could allow AMC to equitize its debt, but it would likely result in significant losses for shareholders[3].\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The movie theater industry as a whole has been severely impacted by the pandemic, with many theaters experiencing drastic declines in revenue and attendance.\n- AMC's ability to avoid bankruptcy thus far is an exception rather than the rule, and the company's continued reliance on issuing new shares and debt restructuring suggests a precarious financial situation.\n\n### Time to Resolution\nThe critical period for AMC will be the next year, especially as the company approaches the 2026 deadline for its significant debt obligations. If the company cannot restructure its debt or improve its revenue significantly, the likelihood of bankruptcy increases.\n\nIn summary, while AMC Theatres has managed to avoid bankruptcy thus far through various financial maneuvers, the risk of a bankruptcy filing before January 1, 2025, remains significant due to the company's ongoing financial struggles and high debt levels. The answer to whether AMC will file for bankruptcy before this date is not immediately clear, but the indicators suggest a high risk.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has AMC Theatres recently missed any scheduled debt payments?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no explicit mention of AMC Theatres recently missing any scheduled debt payments. The sources discuss AMC's significant debt obligations, the need for debt restructuring, and the financial challenges the company is facing, but they do not specify that AMC has missed any scheduled debt payments.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does AMC Theatres currently have debt obligations exceeding $2 billion?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. still has significant debt obligations. Despite recent refinancing transactions that extended debt maturities from 2026 to 2029 and beyond, the company's total debt remains substantial. For instance, AMC had $4.5 billion in debt as of 2023, and while some debt maturities have been extended, the total debt load is still well over $2 billion[1][2][3].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has AMC Theatres' share price declined by over 50% in the past two years?\nANSWER: Yes, AMC Theatres' share price has declined significantly over the past two years.\n\nAs of the end of 2022, AMC's stock price had fallen from $26.52 to $4.07, a decline of 84.65%[1].\n\nBy April 11, 2024, the stock price had further declined to $2.8 per share[3], indicating a continued downward trend.\n\nThis cumulative decline over the two years is well over 50%.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has AMC Theatres' management publicly acknowledged the risk of bankruptcy in their recent statements?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nAMC Theatres' management and related analyses have publicly acknowledged the risk of bankruptcy in recent statements. For instance, the company's financial health is described as being burdened by substantial liabilities, and there is mention of the potential for bankruptcy and subsequent restructuring if the company's cash reserves are depleted[4].\n\nAdditionally, while the immediate risk of bankruptcy was mitigated in 2021 due to a significant cash infusion, the ongoing financial challenges and the possibility of future cash drain are still highlighted in recent reports[3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has AMC Theatres reported operational losses exceeding $100 million in the past fiscal year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information about the operational losses for the entire past fiscal year. The sources detail the financial results for the third quarter of 2024, including a net loss of $20.7 million for that quarter, but they do not provide a comprehensive view of the entire fiscal year's operational losses.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether AMC Theatres reported operational losses exceeding $100 million in the past fiscal year is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has AMC Theatres secured additional financing or refinancing agreements in the last six months?\nANSWER: YES\n\nIn the last six months, AMC Theatres has secured refinancing agreements. Specifically, they announced collaborative refinancing transactions that extended up to $2.45 billion of debt maturities from 2026 to 2029 and beyond, as reported in July 2024[3].\n\nAdditionally, in September 2024, it was mentioned that AMC shifted $2.4 billion in 2026 debt maturities to 2029 and 2030, which is another instance of refinancing agreements[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has AMC Theatres been unable to service its debt obligations in the past year?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAMC Theatres has faced significant challenges in servicing its debt obligations over the past year. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- AMC has a high debt burden of nearly $5 billion, which has compressed its cash flow margins and made it difficult to generate enough cash to service its debt obligations. The company has relied on issuing more shares and bonds to raise capital[2][3].\n- Despite refinancing transactions to extend debt maturities, AMC continues to face financial strain, including high interest payments on its debt and ongoing negative cash flow[1][3].\n- The company has burned a significant amount of cash in operations and is expected to continue doing so, which exacerbates its debt servicing issues[3].\n\nThese points indicate that AMC Theatres has indeed struggled to service its debt obligations in the past year.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has AMC Theatres implemented significant cost-cutting measures in the last year?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nAMC Theatres has implemented several significant cost-cutting measures in recent years, including those within the last year. Here are some examples:\n\n- AMC has tightened operating hours and mitigated costs by reducing operating hours, such as opening theatres only on weekends or having fewer showings per day[1][2].\n- The company has right-sized its theatre portfolio, which involves optimizing the number and operation of its theatres[2].\n- AMC has reduced personnel-related costs, including the cancellation of pending merit pay raises, elimination or reduction of non-healthcare benefits, and the elimination of corporate level positions[1].\n- The company has renegotiated theatre leases and terminated or deferred non-essential operating expenses and capital expenditures[1].\n- AMC has also pushed innovation in merchandise and food & beverage sales to generate additional revenue streams[2].\n\nThese measures have been part of AMC's strategy to navigate the financial challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and other industry setbacks.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the movie theater industry experiencing ongoing financial difficulties due to reduced attendance?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThe movie theater industry is indeed experiencing ongoing financial difficulties due to reduced attendance. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The summer of 2024 has seen disappointing box office numbers, with movies like *The Fall Guy* and *Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga* performing below expectations, contributing to a 25 percent decline in box office revenue compared to 2023 and a 40 percent decline compared to 2019[1].\n\n- Labor strikes have reduced the movie pipeline, resulting in fewer films being released and thus fewer reasons for moviegoers to attend theaters[1][2].\n\n- High inflation has led consumers to be more cautious about spending on movie tickets, further reducing attendance[2].\n\n- Despite some efforts to enhance the movie-going experience, such as offering premium formats and more comfortable seating, the industry is still struggling with declining ticket sales and revenue[2][3].\n\nThese factors collectively indicate that the movie theater industry is facing significant financial difficulties due to reduced attendance.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have AMC Theatres' revenues decreased by more than 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels in the past year?\nANSWER: To determine if AMC Theatres' revenues have decreased by more than 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels in the past year, we need to compare the current revenue with the pre-pandemic revenue.\n\n### Current Revenue\n- For the year ending December 31, 2023, AMC Entertainment Holdings had annual revenue of $4.81 billion[3].\n- For the last twelve months ending September 30, 2024, the company's revenue was $4.44 billion, which is a decrease of 5.62% year-over-year[3].\n\n### Pre-Pandemic Revenue\n- For the year ending December 31, 2019, AMC Entertainment Holdings had annual revenue of $5.47 billion[3].\n\n### Comparison\n- The revenue for the last twelve months ending September 30, 2024, is $4.44 billion.\n- The pre-pandemic revenue for 2019 was $5.47 billion.\n- The decrease from $5.47 billion to $4.44 billion is approximately 18.8%, which is more than 10%.\n\nTherefore, AMC Theatres' revenues have indeed decreased by more than 10% compared to pre-pandemic levels in the past year.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 1.4 months (from November 19, 2024, to January 1, 2025).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf AMC Theatres does not secure additional financing, successfully restructure its debt, or significantly improve its cash flow, the company would likely be unable to meet its financial obligations. This scenario would result in AMC filing for bankruptcy protection before January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about one-third of the current time frame (approximately one third of a month), the probability of bankruptcy filing would likely increase significantly due to the reduced time for any financial maneuvering or restructuring efforts. In this accelerated timeline, the probability might escalate to around 70%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith extended time (approximately 5.6 months), AMC would have more opportunity to implement financial strategies, secure additional financing, or restructure its debt to avoid bankruptcy. This extended period would likely reduce the probability of a bankruptcy filing, potentially lowering it to around 40%.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nAMC Theatres is currently navigating significant financial challenges, including high debt levels, negative cash flow, and declining revenues. Despite recent refinancing efforts that have extended debt maturities, the company continues to struggle with servicing its obligations. Management has publicly acknowledged the risk of bankruptcy, and the broader movie theater industry is experiencing ongoing financial difficulties due to reduced attendance and lower box office revenues.\n\nGiven the limited time frame of approximately 1.4 months until January 1, 2025, AMC faces a critical period to either secure additional financing, successfully restructure its debt, or achieve a turnaround in its financial performance. The short duration intensifies the pressure on the company to avert bankruptcy. While refinancing efforts provide some temporary relief, the underlying financial issues remain substantial, and the likelihood of bankruptcy remains significant if no substantial changes occur in the near term.\n\nConsidering base rates for companies in similar financial distress and the specific circumstances surrounding AMC, a calibrated probability taking into account the imminent deadline, ongoing financial struggles, and recent management statements leads to the following estimate.\n\n**Probability: 55%**",
