    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Ohio voters approve Ohio Issue 1, which seeks to end gerrymandering in the state?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-30\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ohio Issue 1 is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nWikipedia: [2024 Ohio Issue 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Ohio_Issue_1)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Ohio voters approving Issue 1, which aims to reform the state's redistricting process, here are some key points and context that could influence the outcome:\n\n## Background on Issue 1\n- Issue 1 is a proposed constitutional amendment that seeks to change Ohio's system for drawing political district maps for Congress members and state lawmakers. It aims to create a 15-member independent redistricting commission, composed of five registered Republicans, five registered Democrats, and five individuals who are neither, to draw district maps.\n- The commission would be tasked with creating maps that reflect the statewide partisan preferences of voters, ensuring that the number of districts favoring each major party corresponds closely to the statewide vote share.\n\n## Controversy and Misleading Language\n- There is significant controversy over the ballot language, with proponents arguing that the language crafted by the Ohio Ballot Board, which has a GOP majority, is misleading and suggests that Issue 1 would require gerrymandering rather than prevent it. The Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that most of the ballot language is consistent with the measure's full text, but required revisions to two sections.\n- Critics, particularly from the Ohio Republican Party, argue that Issue 1 would actually legalize gerrymandering by mandating maps that favor specific partisan outcomes, which they claim undermines democratic principles.\n\n## Public Perception and Support\n- Despite the controversy, polls suggest that there is significant public support for Issue 1. A YouGov poll found a large lead in support for the measure when voters were informed that it would establish a bipartisan redistricting commission and ban partisan gerrymandering. However, this support may be influenced by the clarity of the explanation rather than the actual ballot language.\n\n## Previous Redistricting Reforms\n- Ohio voters have previously supported reforms aimed at reducing gerrymandering. In 2015 and 2018, voters approved amendments to the Ohio Constitution that created the current redistricting commission and processes for drawing legislative and congressional district maps. These reforms were intended to be neutral and prevent gerrymandering.\n\n## Time to Resolution\n- The vote on Issue 1 is scheduled for November 5, 2024, with early voting starting on October 8. The outcome will be determined by the majority vote of Ohio voters on that day.\n\n## Reference Classes\n- The success of similar redistricting reforms in other states and the historical context of Ohio's previous reforms could provide insights. However, the unique controversy surrounding the ballot language in this case adds a layer of complexity that may not be directly comparable to other instances.\n\nGiven these points, while there is significant support for the principles behind Issue 1, the misleading ballot language and the intense partisan debate could impact voter decisions. Therefore, it is not immediately clear whether Ohio voters will approve Issue 1, and the outcome will depend on how effectively each side communicates their message to voters and how voters interpret the ballot language.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Ohio previously passed ballot measures aimed at redistricting reform?\nANSWER: YES\n\nOhio has previously passed ballot measures aimed at redistricting reform. For example:\n\n- In 2015, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment to reform the process for drawing state legislative districts.\n- In 2018, Ohio voters approved another constitutional amendment, known as Ohio Issue 1, which changed the vote requirements and standards for congressional redistricting.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a strong public campaign advocating for the approval of Issue 1?\nANSWER: Yes, there is a strong public campaign advocating for the approval of Ohio's Issue 1. The campaign in support of Issue 1, led by groups such as Citizens Not Politicians, has raised and spent significant amounts of money, with nearly $11 million raised and $11.2 million spent on ads and other campaign expenses from July through October 16, 2024. Additionally, other pro-Issue 1 groups have contributed further funds, and the campaign has received substantial support from labor unions, national liberal advocacy groups, and other notable donors.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Issue 1 require only a simple majority to pass in the 2024 general election?\nANSWER: Based on the information provided, Issue 1 in the 2024 general election, which pertains to the redistricting process, does not specify any change to the voting threshold. The standard procedure for passing a constitutional amendment in Ohio typically requires a simple majority.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **YES**, Issue 1 requires only a simple majority to pass in the 2024 general election.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do recent polls indicate that a majority of Ohio voters support Issue 1?\nANSWER: Yes, recent polls indicate that a majority of Ohio voters support Issue 1.\n\n- A poll conducted by the Democracy and Public Policy Research Network at Bowling Green State University found that 60% of likely Ohio voters plan to vote \"yes\" on Issue 1, with 20% planning to vote \"no\" and 20% undecided.\n- The Baldwin Wallace University Ohio Pulse Poll showed that 58% of likely voters favor the passage of Issue 1, which would enshrine abortion rights in the Ohio Constitution.\n- Despite some variations in support based on the wording of the ballot language, the overall trend across these polls suggests strong support for Issue 1 among Ohio voters.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do Ohio voters generally support constitutional amendments proposed via ballot measures?\nANSWER: The support for constitutional amendments proposed via ballot measures among Ohio voters is not uniformly consistent and can vary depending on the specific issue and the context of the vote.\n\n- In the case of State Issue 1, which proposed increasing the voter approval threshold for constitutional amendments to 60%, Ohio voters overwhelmingly rejected the measure, indicating a preference for maintaining the current simple majority requirement.\n- Conversely, in the November 2023 election, Ohio voters approved a constitutional amendment protecting access to abortion and other reproductive health care, showing strong support for this specific issue.\n\nGiven these varying outcomes, it is unclear whether Ohio voters generally support all constitutional amendments proposed via ballot measures, as their support seems to be issue-specific. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have similar anti-gerrymandering measures been approved by voters in other states in recent years?\nANSWER: Yes, similar anti-gerrymandering measures have been approved by voters in other states in recent years.\n\nFor example, in November 2018, voters in three states passed ballot initiatives to curb gerrymandering by reforming the redistricting process. These initiatives established independent redistricting commissions and implemented anti-gerrymandering requirements.\n\nAdditionally, there have been ongoing efforts and lawsuits in various states, such as Utah, where voters had previously passed measures to establish independent redistricting commissions to prevent gerrymandering, although these measures were later challenged or overridden by state legislatures.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout in Ohio expected to be high for the 2024 general election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are indications that voter turnout in Ohio for the 2024 general election could be significant, although the expectations vary slightly.\n\n- In Clark and Champaign counties, early voting turnout has been steady, though not as robust as in 2020. However, the directors of the boards of elections in these counties expect a high turnout, with Jason Baker of Clark County anticipating a turnout rate near or above 70% and Chris Creamer of Champaign County expecting a lot of voters to vote early given current trends.\n\n- Early voting across Ohio is continuing at a record pace, which suggests a strong interest in the election.\n\n- While the turnout may not match the 2020 levels in some areas, the overall trend and expectations from election officials suggest that voter turnout is likely to be high.\n\nGiven these points, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the ballot language for Issue 1 considered misleading by non-partisan organizations?\nANSWER: The ballot language for Issue 1 is indeed considered misleading by non-partisan organizations and some individuals involved in the issue.\n\n- Citizens Not Politicians, a non-partisan coalition, has argued that the ballot language approved by the Ohio Ballot Board is \"biased, inaccurate, deceptive, and unconstitutional\" and that it violates the Ohio Constitution by misleading voters.\n- The group has provided examples of how the language, such as describing the amendment as requiring the commission to \"gerrymander the boundaries of state legislative and congressional districts to favor the two largest political parties,\" is misleading and does not accurately reflect the purpose of the amendment, which is to ban partisan gerrymandering.\n- Some voters, like Kelly Vogt, have also expressed that the language confused them and led them to vote against the amendment when they intended to support it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the controversy over the ballot language significantly affected public perception of Issue 1?\nANSWER: The impact of the controversy over the ballot language on public perception of Issue 1 is not entirely clear, but there are some indications that it could be significant.\n\n- Proponents of Issue 1, such as Citizens Not Politicians, have expressed concerns that the misleading and biased ballot language could confuse voters and influence their decisions. They argue that the language is designed to make the amendment less appealing and to maintain the current political power dynamics.\n\n- There are reports of voters being confused by the language. For example, a voter mentioned that the GOP-crafted ballot summary tricked him into initially opposing the reform he actually supports.\n\n- Despite the confusion, a poll conducted by YouGov found that support for Issue 1 still had a large lead, but this poll did not use the actual ballot language. Instead, it explained the amendment in a way that proponents argue is more accurate and clear.\n\n- The dissenting opinions from the liberal justices on the Ohio Supreme Court also highlight the potential for the ballot language to mislead voters, which could affect public perception.\n\nGiven these points, while there is evidence suggesting the controversy could affect public perception, the full extent of this impact is not definitively quantified in the sources provided.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major Ohio political parties or influential figures endorsing Issue 1?\nANSWER: The endorsement of Issue 1 by major Ohio political parties or influential figures is mixed and complex.\n\n### Support\n- Issue 1 has garnered support from various organizations and individuals across different political backgrounds. It is endorsed by organizations such as the League of Women Voters of Ohio, the AFL-CIO, American Federation of Teachers, Brennan Center for Justice, NAACP, and others.\n- Retired Ohio Supreme Court justices, Maureen O’Connor (Republican) and Yvette McGee-Brown (Democrat), have also supported the initiative.\n\n### Opposition\n- The Republican Senate leadership and other prominent Republican figures, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Governor Mike DeWine, and GOP Congressmen, have opposed Issue 1. They argue that the proposed commission would lack accountability to voters and represent an attack on democracy.\n- A bipartisan group of Black leaders, including Republican State Senator Michelle Reynolds and former Democratic State Representative John Barnes, have also come out in opposition, citing concerns about the potential impact on minority representation.\n\nIn summary, while there is some bipartisan support, particularly from retired justices and various civic organizations, the major political parties are not uniformly endorsing Issue 1. The Republican party, in particular, has significant opposition to the amendment.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (in terms of uniform endorsement by major Ohio political parties, but there is clear support and opposition from various influential figures and organizations).",
    "comment": "**(a)** **Time left until outcome is known:** 6 days (from October 30, 2024, to November 5, 2024).\n\n---\n\n**(b)** **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If nothing changed, Ohio voters would likely approve Issue 1.\n\n---\n\n**(c)** **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With approximately 1.5 days left, I would forecast a slightly higher probability of approval due to decreased time for opposition campaigns to influence voters.\n\n---\n\n**(d)** **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** With about 24 days remaining, I would forecast a slightly lower probability of approval, acknowledging more time for potential shifts in public opinion and increased efforts by opponents.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Polling Data:** Recent polls indicate strong support for Issue 1 among Ohio voters. For instance, a poll by the Democracy and Public Policy Research Network at Bowling Green State University found that 60% of likely voters plan to vote \"yes\" on Issue 1, with 20% planning to vote \"no\" and 20% undecided. This suggests a majority favor the amendment.\n\n- **Historical Precedence:** Ohio voters have a history of supporting redistricting reforms aimed at reducing gerrymandering. In 2015 and 2018, voters approved constitutional amendments to reform the redistricting process, demonstrating a willingness to endorse such measures.\n\n- **Public Campaigns:** There is a strong public campaign advocating for the approval of Issue 1. Proponents have raised and spent significant funds on campaigning and advertising. Support comes from various organizations, including labor unions, national advocacy groups, and bipartisan coalitions.\n\n- **Ballot Language Controversy:** The ballot language for Issue 1 is considered misleading by non-partisan organizations and may confuse voters. The Ohio Supreme Court required revisions to certain sections but upheld most of the language crafted by the GOP-majority Ohio Ballot Board. This could potentially diminish support if voters misunderstand the amendment's intent.\n\n- **Opposition Factors:** Major political figures and the Ohio Republican Party oppose Issue 1, arguing that it could mandate gerrymandering and undermine democratic principles. Additionally, some bipartisan leaders express concerns about the impact on minority representation.\n\n- **Voter Turnout:** Voter turnout is expected to be high for the 2024 general election. High turnout often benefits ballot measures advocating for reform, as more voters participate in decision-making.\n\n- **Similar Measures in Other States:** Voters in other states have approved similar anti-gerrymandering measures in recent years, indicating a national trend toward supporting redistricting reforms.\n\n- **Potential Impact of Time Remaining:** With only 6 days left, significant shifts in public opinion are less likely, but last-minute campaigning could still influence undecided voters. If there were more time remaining, the opposition might have a greater chance to sway public perception.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 75%**",
