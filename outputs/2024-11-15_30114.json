If the awards ceremony takes place and Astro Bot does not win Game of the Year, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe Game Awards ceremony is [currently scheduled](https://thegameawards.com/watch) for December 12, 2024. Any delays will still count. However, if the ceremony does not take place before January 1, 2025, this question will be **Annulled**. \n\nIf Astro Bot shares the Game of the Year award it will still count.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n[The Game Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards), launched in 2014 and founded by video game journalist Geoff Keighley, are widely recognized as one of the most prestigious annual events in the video game industry. The Game of the Year (GOTY) award honors a game that delivers the best experience across both creative and technical aspects. The nominations for GOTY 2024 are expected to be announced in mid November.\n\n[Astro Bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro_Bot) is a 2024 platform video game developed by Team Asobi and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 5. It is a sequel to [Astro's Playroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astro%27s_Playroom) and the first game featuring the character not to be developed by Japan Studio due to its dissolution. The game was released in celebration of PlayStation's 30th anniversary and, as of November 2024, has sold 1.5 million units. It has received universal acclaim from critics, with a score of 94 on [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/astro-bot/), and is widely considered a favourite of for GOTY.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Astro Bot winning the Game of the Year 2024 award at The Game Awards, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Nomination Likelihood\nAstro Bot is widely expected to be nominated for the Game of the Year award. Several sources indicate that it, along with games like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Metaphor: ReFantazio, are strong contenders for the nomination[2][4].\n\n## Critical Acclaim\nAstro Bot has received significant critical acclaim, with a Metascore of 94 on Metacritic. This high score is a strong indicator of its quality and potential for winning awards[1][4].\n\n## Competition\nThe competition for Game of the Year is robust, with other notable games such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and Black Myth: Wukong also in the running. Each of these games has its own strengths and fan support[2][4].\n\n## Voting Process\nThe winners of The Game Awards are decided by a blended vote, with 90% of the vote coming from a specialized jury and 10% from public fan voting. This process can sometimes lead to surprises, as both critical and public opinions are factored in[4].\n\n## Historical Context\nPast winners of the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards have often been games with high critical acclaim and significant impact on the gaming community. However, the award can sometimes go to a game that is not the absolute favorite but still highly regarded. For example, in 2021, It Takes Two won despite not having the highest Metascore among the nominees[1].\n\n## Current Predictions and Opinions\nSeveral predictions and opinions from gaming communities and analysts suggest that Astro Bot is a strong contender, but there is no consensus on a clear winner. Some predict Astro Bot might win due to its innovative gameplay and celebration of PlayStation's 30th anniversary, while others argue that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth or other games could also take the award[1][2][5].\n\nGiven these points, while Astro Bot has a strong chance of winning due to its critical acclaim and innovative design, the outcome is not certain. The competition is fierce, and the voting process involves both jury and public input, which can lead to unexpected results.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, games with high Metascores and significant critical acclaim have a higher likelihood of winning.\n- However, the voting process and the subjective nature of game awards mean that other factors, such as public sentiment and jury preferences, can influence the outcome.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The nominees will be announced on November 18, 2024, and the winners will be revealed on December 12, 2024. This provides a clear timeline for when the outcome will be known.\n\nIn summary, while Astro Bot is a strong contender, the question of whether it will win the Game of the Year 2024 award cannot be answered with certainty at this time.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Astro Bot sold over 1.5 million units as of November 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of November 3, 2024, Astro Bot has sold 1.5 million units, as confirmed by multiple sources including Sony's financial earnings call and various reports[1][2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Astro Bot's Metacritic score 94 or higher?\nANSWER: Yes, Astro Bot's Metacritic score is 94. Multiple sources confirm that the game has a Metacritic score of 94, which is the second-highest score of the year, just behind the *Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree* expansion[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Astro Bot been nominated for the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards 2024?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR\n\nWhile the sources suggest that Astro Bot is a strong contender and a likely nominee for the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards 2024, they do not confirm the actual nominees. The nominees will be officially revealed on November 18, 2024[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have games developed by Team Asobi won major awards in the past?\nANSWER: Yes, games developed by Team Asobi have won major awards in the past.\n\nFor example, *Astro Bot Rescue Mission* won several notable awards, including \"Best VR/AR Game\" at The Game Awards 2018 and \"VR Game of the Year\" at The Edge Awards 2018. It also won the \"Special Award\" at the Famitsu Awards and the \"Game\" category at the British Academy Children's Awards[1][2].\n\nAdditionally, *Astro's Playroom* and other games by Team Asobi have received various nominations and awards, further highlighting their success in the gaming industry[1][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Final Fantasy VII Rebirth also nominated for Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the available information, it is highly likely that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be nominated for Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2024, but the official nominees have not yet been announced.\n\n- The sources suggest that games like Astro Bot, Metaphor: ReFantazio, and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth are expected to be among the nominees, but the official list will be revealed on November 18, 2024[5].\n\nGiven that the nominees have not been officially confirmed yet, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has a platform-exclusive game won the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards in recent years?\nANSWER: No, a platform-exclusive game has not won the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards in recent years.\n\n- In 2023, the Game of the Year was awarded to *Baldur's Gate 3*, which is not a platform-exclusive game as it is available on multiple platforms, including PC and Xbox[1][3][5].\n- In 2022, the Game of the Year was *Elden Ring*, which is also available on multiple platforms[3].\n- In 2021 and previous years, the winners were similarly multi-platform games[3].\n\nTherefore, there is no recent instance of a platform-exclusive game winning the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Astro Bot considered a leading contender for Game of the Year by major gaming publications?\nANSWER: Yes, Astro Bot is considered a leading contender for Game of the Year by major gaming publications.\n\nSeveral sources highlight its critical acclaim and its position as the best-reviewed game of the year so far. For example, GameSpot notes that Astro Bot has the highest Metacritic score of the year, beating out other strong contenders like Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Tekken 8[1].\n\nTheGamer also mentions that Astro Bot is the current frontrunner for Game of the Year, citing its universal appeal and high critical rating[2].\n\nAdditionally, CBR and Game Rant emphasize its strong contender status for 2024's Game of the Year, highlighting its exceptional reviews and critical reception[4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does The Game Awards tend to favor games with high critical acclaim over commercial success?\nANSWER: The Game Awards process suggests that the awards tend to favor games with high critical acclaim rather than solely focusing on commercial success.\n\nHere are the key points that support this:\n\n- The nominees are selected by a panel of over 100 global media and influencer outlets recognized for their critical evaluation of video games. These outlets submit unranked ballots listing their top five choices, and the games that appear most frequently on these ballots are selected as nominees[1][4][3].\n- The winners are determined by a combined vote, with 90% of the vote coming from the jury (comprising industry experts and critics) and 10% from public voting. This weighting gives significant importance to the critical opinions of the jury[1][3][4].\n- The criteria for selection include gameplay, storytelling, graphics, and innovation, which are more aligned with critical evaluation rather than commercial success[2][4].\n\nTherefore, the process emphasizes the critical acclaim and technical/creative merits of the games over their commercial performance.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Astro Bot widely acclaimed for innovative gameplay mechanics?\nANSWER: Yes, Astro Bot is widely acclaimed for its innovative gameplay mechanics.\n\n- The game is praised for its creative combination of old and new mechanics, with reviewers noting that it \"feels like a combination of 1/3 remixed greatest hit mechanics from the series’ previous entries and 2/3 wildly creative new ideas\"[2].\n- It is highlighted for its unique level designs, each with its own themes, mechanics, and gimmicks, which keep the gameplay fresh and engaging[3][4].\n- The use of the PS5’s DualSense controller, with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, is also commended for adding a tactile and immersive experience to the game[1][2][5].\n- The game’s ability to incorporate temporary powers and items, such as frog-mittens, chicken backpacks, and penguin suits, adds a layer of innovation and excitement to the gameplay[2][4].\n- Reviewers consistently mention the game's ability to surprise and delight players with new mechanics, gameplay twists, and smart boss battles, which sets it apart from other platformers[1][4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any significant controversies surrounding Astro Bot that could negatively impact its chances of winning?\nANSWER: Yes, there are significant controversies surrounding Astro Bot that could potentially impact its reception and chances of winning awards or achieving widespread acclaim.\n\n1. **Cameos Controversy**: The inclusion of cameos from other PlayStation franchises, such as *Days Gone*, has been criticized by some, notably John Garvin, the former creative director of *Days Gone*. He felt that the character Deacon St. John was being exploited and reduced to a \"cartoon schill\" for a \"small game\"[1][2].\n\n2. **Industry and Legacy Criticism**: There is a broader criticism about the industry's use of cameos and nostalgia, with some arguing that it highlights the lack of new content and the discontinuation of beloved franchises. This criticism suggests that the industry is more focused on marketability than on producing quality, new stories[1].\n\n3. **Regional Sales Performance**: In Japan, the game's sales have been reported as disappointing, which could reflect a broader disconnection between Japanese gamers and Sony's recent offerings[5].\n\n4. **Community and Fan Reactions**: There are also mixed reactions from fans and critics, with some expressing dissatisfaction with various aspects of the game, such as its design or the inclusion of certain characters. While these reactions are not universally negative, they do contribute to a complex and sometimes contentious discourse around the game[3][4].\n\nThese controversies, while not necessarily universal, do indicate that there are significant issues and criticisms surrounding Astro Bot that could impact its overall reception and chances of winning awards.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 27 days.\n\n(b) **If nothing changed,** Astro Bot would remain a strong contender for the Game of the Year 2024 award due to its high critical acclaim and innovative gameplay. However, the outcome would still be uncertain because of significant competition and existing controversies that could influence the jury's decision.\n\n(c) **If there was only a quarter of the time left** (approximately 7 days), I would forecast a slightly higher probability for Astro Bot winning. With less time remaining, the current momentum and positive critical reception would have a stronger impact, and there would be limited opportunity for competitors to sway opinions or for new controversies to arise. **Estimated probability:** 35%.\n\n(d) **If there was 4 times the time left** (approximately 108 days), I would forecast a lower probability for Astro Bot winning. Extended time could allow competitors to gain more visibility, release new content, or for additional controversies to affect Astro Bot's standing. **Estimated probability:** 25%.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nAstro Bot is a critically acclaimed game with a Metacritic score of 94, making it one of the highest-rated games of the year. Its innovative gameplay mechanics and celebration of PlayStation's 30th anniversary have garnered it significant attention and praise. Major gaming publications consider it a leading contender for the Game of the Year award.\n\nHowever, several factors may impact its chances:\n\n1. **Strong Competition:** Titles like *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*, *Metaphor: ReFantazio*, and *Black Myth: Wukong* are also strong contenders. *Final Fantasy VII Rebirth*, in particular, has a massive fan base and significant hype, which could sway both the jury and public votes.\n\n2. **Controversies:** There are notable controversies surrounding Astro Bot, such as criticisms over the inclusion of cameos from other PlayStation franchises. Figures like John Garvin have publicly criticized these choices, which could negatively influence perceptions among industry professionals and the jury.\n\n3. **Voting Process:** The Game Awards' voting system allocates 90% of the decision to a jury of industry experts and 10% to public fan votes. The jury's perspectives are crucial, and any controversies might weigh heavily in their evaluation.\n\n4. **Historical Trends:** In recent years, platform-exclusive games have not won the Game of the Year award at The Game Awards. Multi-platform titles tend to have a broader reach and impact, which might influence the final decision.\n\n5. **Public and Jury Sentiment:** While Astro Bot has strong critical acclaim, the mixed reactions from fans and the potential for jury members to favor other titles with fewer controversies or broader appeal could reduce its chances.\n\nConsidering these factors, while Astro Bot has a solid chance due to its critical success, the combination of strong competition and potential negative impacts from controversies lowers its probability of winning.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 30%**",
