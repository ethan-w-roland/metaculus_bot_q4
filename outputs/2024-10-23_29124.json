{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill South Dakota voters approve Constitutional Amendment G, which would provide for a state constitutional right to an abortion?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-23\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Dakota Constitutional Amendment G is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reporting. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [South Dakota Constitutional Amendment G, Right to Abortion Initiative (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/South_Dakota_Constitutional_Amendment_G,_Right_to_Abortion_Initiative_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of South Dakota voters approving Constitutional Amendment G, which aims to establish a state constitutional right to abortion, here are some key points and context that could influence the outcome:\n\n## Current Abortion Laws in South Dakota\n- Abortion is currently banned in South Dakota except to save the life of the mother, following the overturning of *Roe v. Wade* and the reactivation of a 2005 state law.\n\n## Proposed Amendment\n- Constitutional Amendment G would introduce a trimester framework for regulating abortion:\n  - No regulation during the first trimester.\n  - Regulation allowed in the second trimester only if reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman.\n  - Regulation or prohibition allowed in the third trimester, except when necessary to preserve the life or health of the pregnant woman.\n\n## Public and Organizational Opinions\n- Proponents argue that the amendment would restore reproductive freedoms similar to those under *Roe v. Wade* and provide a necessary layer of protection in the state constitution.\n- Opponents, including some pro-life groups and even some pro-choice organizations like the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, argue against the amendment. Pro-life groups see it as a threat to their efforts to restrict abortion, while some pro-choice advocates believe the framework does not go far enough and could be legally challenging.\n\n## Historical Context and Base Rates\n- In recent years, voters in several states have rejected anti-abortion measures and supported pro-abortion rights initiatives. For example, voters in Kansas, Kentucky, and Montana have rejected anti-abortion measures, and voters in California, Michigan, Vermont, and Ohio have supported pro-abortion rights measures.\n- However, South Dakota has historically been conservative on abortion issues, which could influence voter behavior.\n\n## Legal and Political Landscape\n- The amendment faces legal challenges, with some groups questioning the validity of the signatures collected to place it on the ballot.\n\nGiven these points, the outcome of the vote is not immediately clear. Here are some factors to consider for a superforecaster:\n\n- **Public Sentiment**: The historical and current political climate in South Dakota suggests a conservative leaning, which might affect support for the amendment.\n- **Organizational Support**: The lack of endorsement from some major pro-choice organizations could impact the amendment's chances.\n- **Legal Challenges**: Any ongoing legal disputes about the amendment's placement on the ballot could influence voter confidence and turnout.\n- **Reference Classes**: The outcomes of similar ballot measures in other states can provide some insight, but local sentiment and specific legal frameworks must also be considered.\n\nWithout additional polling data or more detailed insights into current voter sentiment, it is challenging to predict with certainty whether South Dakota voters will approve Constitutional Amendment G.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have major pro-choice organizations, such as Planned Parenthood or the ACLU, officially endorsed Constitutional Amendment G?\nANSWER: No, major pro-choice organizations such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU have not officially endorsed Constitutional Amendment G in South Dakota.\n\nAccording to the sources, Planned Parenthood North Central States and the ACLU of South Dakota do not support the amendment as drafted, citing that it does not go far enough to reinstate the right to abortion in South Dakota.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Constitutional Amendment G successfully qualified for the 2024 general election ballot in South Dakota?\nANSWER: Yes, Constitutional Amendment G has successfully qualified for the 2024 general election ballot in South Dakota.\n\nThe amendment gathered more than the required 35,017 valid signatures, with over 55,000 signatures submitted, and the secretary of state's office confirmed that there were an estimated 46,098 valid signatures, which exceeded the necessary threshold. The secretary of state certified the petition on May 17, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have conservative states similar to South Dakota recently approved pro-abortion rights ballot measures?\nANSWER: Yes, conservative states similar to South Dakota have recently approved pro-abortion rights ballot measures.\n\nSince the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, several conservative states have seen voters support abortion rights through ballot measures. For example:\n\n- In Kansas, a conservative state, voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the state legislature to ban abortion in August 2022.\n- In Ohio, another conservative-leaning state, voters approved a constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights in 2023.\n\nThese instances demonstrate that even in conservative states, there is a willingness among voters to support measures that protect or expand abortion access. This trend is expected to continue in the 2024 elections with several conservative states, including Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota, having abortion-related measures on their ballots.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant opposition from pro-life groups in South Dakota against Constitutional Amendment G?\nANSWER: YES, there is significant opposition from pro-life groups in South Dakota against Constitutional Amendment G.\n\n- The **Life Defense Fund** is leading the campaign opposing the initiative, characterizing it as one of the most extreme abortion laws in the nation and arguing that it would legalize late-term abortions.\n- Over 220 faith leaders from diverse religious traditions have also come together to oppose Amendment G, highlighting their concerns about the impact on unborn children.\n- Additionally, there are legal challenges, such as a lawsuit filed by the Life Defense Fund to remove the measure from the ballot, further indicating strong opposition from pro-life groups.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does South Dakota have a strong conservative political climate on social issues, including abortion?\nANSWER: Yes, South Dakota is known for having a strong conservative political climate, including on social issues such as abortion.\n\n- The state is described as \"overwhelmingly conservative\" and the Republican Party has been the dominant party in the state since territorial times[5|.\n- South Dakota has a history of embracing conservative policies, and by the 1950s, it had already shifted towards a more conservative bent[1|.\n- Recent surveys and political analyses also indicate that the state's political climate remains conservative, with many residents holding traditional or conservative views on various social issues. For example, the state's legislature has been noted for consistently introducing and supporting legislation that aligns with conservative values, including those related to social issues.\n\nRegarding abortion specifically, South Dakota has been at the forefront of conservative legislation, often passing laws that restrict abortion access, which aligns with the state's overall conservative stance on social issues.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent polls shown a majority of South Dakota voters support establishing a constitutional right to abortion?\nANSWER: Recent polls indicate a more nuanced and changing landscape in support for establishing a constitutional right to abortion in South Dakota, rather than a clear majority.\n\n- A poll conducted from October 12-16 by South Dakota News Watch showed that 50% of registered voters support Amendment G, while 47% are opposed, with 3% undecided. This is within the margin of error and indicates a closely divided electorate.\n- An earlier poll from May had shown a higher level of support, with 53.4% in favor and 35.4% opposed, but this support has dipped in more recent surveys.\n\nGiven the current close division and the shift in support, it cannot be conclusively stated that a majority of South Dakota voters currently support establishing a constitutional right to abortion.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the proposed trimester framework in Constitutional Amendment G controversial among both pro-choice and pro-life groups?\nANSWER: Yes, the proposed trimester framework in Constitutional Amendment G is controversial among both pro-choice and pro-life groups.\n\n### Pro-Life Groups:\nPro-life groups oppose the amendment because it would restore a framework similar to that in *Roe v. Wade*, which they see as allowing too many abortions. State Representative John Hansen and the Life Defense Fund are leading a challenge to the amendment, arguing it would lead to the deaths of unborn children.\n\n### Pro-Choice Groups:\nSome pro-choice groups and leaders, including the ACLU and Planned Parenthood, have criticized the amendment for not going far enough in protecting abortion rights. They argue that the trimester framework is too complicated and could be a target for litigation by pro-life groups, and that it does not provide absolute protections for abortion rights.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any pending legal challenges that could prevent Constitutional Amendment G from appearing on the ballot?\nANSWER: Yes, there are pending legal challenges that could potentially affect the appearance of Constitutional Amendment G on the ballot in South Dakota.\n\n- A lawsuit filed by the Life Defense Fund in state court alleges that the petition circulators for Amendment G violated state laws, including residency affidavit requirements and other misconduct. Despite a federal court's permanent injunction against certain state laws, Life Defense Fund argues that other laws, such as the Mickelson Law, still apply and should invalidate the petition.\n- Dakotans for Health, the organization behind Amendment G, has filed a motion to enforce the federal court's permanent injunction and to dismiss the state court lawsuit, arguing that the Life Defense Fund's allegations are based on laws that have been invalidated.\n- The South Dakota Supreme Court has reversed a lower court's dismissal of the lawsuit, giving Life Defense Fund another chance to plead their case in circuit court. However, the Supreme Court also denied the request to expedite the matter, making it unlikely that the issue will be resolved before the deadline for certifying ballot questions.\n\nThese ongoing legal disputes indicate that there are indeed pending challenges that could impact whether Amendment G appears on the ballot.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has South Dakota historically voted against measures that expand abortion rights?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer to whether South Dakota has historically voted against measures that expand abortion rights is not entirely clear-cut, but there are some indications:\n\n- In 2006 and 2008, South Dakota voters rejected abortion ban measures, which can be interpreted as support for maintaining or expanding abortion rights to some extent. For example, in 2006, Referendum 6, an abortion ban measure, was rejected by 55.57% of voters, and in 2008, Initiative 11, another abortion ban measure, was also rejected by 55.21% of voters.\n\nHowever, the current context and historical voting patterns on specific abortion expansion measures are more complex. The upcoming ballot initiative in 2024 aims to restore abortion rights, and while recent polls indicate support for this measure, it does not necessarily reflect a consistent historical pattern of voting in favor of expanding abortion rights.\n\nGiven the mixed evidence, the best answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there evidence as of 2023 that public opinion in South Dakota is shifting towards greater support for abortion rights?\nANSWER: Yes, there is evidence suggesting that public opinion in South Dakota was shifting towards greater support for abortion rights as of 2023.\n\n- A poll conducted in November 2023 by South Dakota News Watch and the Chiesman Center for Democracy at the University of South Dakota showed that 46% of respondents supported the amendment to restore abortion rights, while 44% were opposed, indicating a narrow but growing support.\n\n- By June 2024, a subsequent poll showed a significant increase in support, with 53% of respondents supporting Constitutional Amendment G, which would reverse the state's abortion ban, and only 35% opposed. This nearly 20-point lead indicates a notable shift in public opinion since the November 2023 poll.\n\nThese polls suggest that public opinion was indeed shifting towards greater support for abortion rights in South Dakota as the issue gained more attention and debate.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\nThere are approximately **13 days** left until the general election on **November 5, 2024**, when the outcome of Constitutional Amendment G will be decided.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf nothing changed between now and the election, based on current polling and trends, the outcome would likely be **uncertain but leaning slightly towards rejection** of the amendment. The most recent poll shows a nearly even split among voters\u201450% in favor and 47% opposed\u2014with a margin of error that makes the result too close to call. However, considering South Dakota's historically conservative stance on abortion and social issues, and the lack of endorsement from major pro-choice organizations, the amendment might **not pass** if the current situation remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith only about **3 days** left until the election, there would be minimal time for any significant shifts in voter opinion. In this scenario, I would forecast a probability of **45%** that the amendment will be approved. This reflects the tight polling numbers but accounts for the likelihood that undecided voters in a conservative state may lean towards maintaining the status quo, resulting in a slight advantage for the opposition.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nIf there were approximately **52 days** left until the election, there would be more opportunity for both supporters and opponents of the amendment to campaign and influence public opinion. With more time, the well-organized opposition from pro-life groups and the lack of strong support from major pro-choice organizations could further sway voters against the amendment. In this case, I would forecast a probability of **40%** that the amendment will be approved, anticipating that extended campaigning might reduce public support for the measure.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nSeveral factors influence the probability that South Dakota voters will approve Constitutional Amendment G:\n\n1. **Polling Data:** Recent polls indicate a **very close race**, with 50% supporting the amendment and 47% opposing it. The margin of error means the outcome is uncertain. However, trends suggest that support has dipped slightly over time, indicating potential momentum against the amendment.\n\n2. **Conservative Political Climate:** South Dakota has a strong conservative political climate, particularly on social issues like abortion. Historically, the state has enacted laws that restrict abortion access, aligning with conservative values.\n\n3. **Lack of Major Organizational Endorsements:** Major pro-choice organizations, such as **Planned Parenthood** and the **ACLU**, have not endorsed the amendment. Their lack of support may hinder the pro-amendment campaign's ability to mobilize voters and effectively counter opposition messaging.\n\n4. **Opposition from Pro-Life Groups:** There is significant and well-organized opposition from pro-life groups in South Dakota. Initiatives like the **Life Defense Fund** are actively campaigning against the amendment and have filed legal challenges, which could influence public perception and voter turnout.\n\n5. **Legal Challenges and Controversies:** Ongoing legal disputes and controversies surrounding the amendment may create uncertainty and skepticism among voters, potentially reducing support for the measure.\n\n6. **Historical Voting Patterns:** In previous instances, South Dakota voters have rejected outright abortion bans (in 2006 and 2008), suggesting some openness to abortion rights. However, the current amendment introduces a trimester framework that is controversial and may not garner the same level of support.\n\n7. **National Trends:** While some conservative states have recently approved pro-abortion rights measures, it's unclear if this trend will hold in South Dakota. Local factors and the specific context of Amendment G play critical roles.\n\n8. **Undecided Voters:** Undecided voters could tip the balance. In conservative states, undecided voters may be more likely to default to the status quo, which currently prohibits abortion.\n\nConsidering these factors, the uncertainty of the polls, and the conservative nature of South Dakota's electorate, there is a **slightly less than even chance** that the amendment will pass. The strong opposition, combined with the lack of major endorsements and potential voter hesitation due to controversies, suggests that the amendment may face challenges in securing a majority approval.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 45%**", "probability": 45}
