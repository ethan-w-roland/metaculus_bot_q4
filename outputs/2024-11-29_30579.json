    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill US airline passenger volume for the week of Christmas through New Years Even 2024 be up year over year, according to the TSA?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-29\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if total passenger volume for the 7-day period from December 25, 2024 to December 31, 2024 exceeds the 7-day period from December 25, 2023 to December 31, 2023. The resolution source is the TSA checkpoint travel numbers, which can be found at [this link](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes) for 2024. The archived 2023 TSA passenger volume numbers can be found [here](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes/2023).\n\nThe 7 days from December 25, 2023, through December 31, 2023, had total daily passenger numbers summing up to 17,307,363. Therefore, this question resolves as **Yes** if total passenger volume for the period of December 25, 2024 through December 31, 2024 exceeds 17,307,363 and resolves as **No** if it is less than or equal to 17,307,363.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe question will resolve as soon as the data is posted and accessed by Metaculus Admins. However, if there are delays then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n2023 was the [busiest travel year ever](https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/2023-numbers-more-flights-fewer-cancellations-more-consumer-protections), with very low cancellation rates, from a historical perspective.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if US airline passenger volume for the week of Christmas through New Year's Eve in 2024 will be up year over year, here are some relevant points from the sources:\n\n## Holiday Travel Trends\n- The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has indicated that the 2024 holiday travel season is expected to be one of the busiest on record. For Thanksgiving, the TSA anticipates a 6% increase in foot traffic and an 17% increase in travelers compared to 2022[2][3][5].\n\n## Passenger Volume Growth\n- In the early months of 2024, airport passenger traffic has already shown significant growth, with volumes in January and February being 6% higher than in 2023 and 5% above the same period in 2019[1].\n- The BTS reported that August 2024 saw a 4.5% increase in systemwide enplanements compared to August 2023, and several months in 2024 have set new all-time highs for passenger enplanements[4].\n\n## Specific Holiday Periods\n- For the Christmas and New Year's period, the TSA and other sources suggest that this time is typically very busy. In 2023, the busiest travel days after Christmas included December 26, 27, 30, and January 2. Given the overall trend of increased travel in 2024, it is plausible that these days could see higher volumes in 2024 as well[2].\n\n## General Travel Confidence and Infrastructure\n- Despite some concerns about delays and cancellations, the overall confidence in avoiding these issues has improved, and the Biden-Harris Administration has taken steps to ensure smoother air travel, including optimizing staffing and improving airport infrastructure[3][5].\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to infer that the US airline passenger volume for the week of Christmas through New Year's Eve in 2024 is likely to be up year over year, aligning with the broader trend of increased travel volumes observed throughout 2024. However, without specific TSA data for the exact period in question, this conclusion is based on the general trends and projections provided.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did systemwide enplanements in August 2024 increase by at least 4.5% compared to August 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, systemwide enplanements in August 2024 increased by at least 4.5% compared to August 2023. According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, systemwide enplanements in August 2024 were 86.8 million, which represents a 4.5% increase from August 2023[1][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have US airlines reported increased booking rates for the Christmas to New Year's period in 2024 compared to 2023?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specifically address whether US airlines have reported increased booking rates for the Christmas to New Year's period in 2024 compared to 2023. The information given focuses on general trends, best times to book flights, and price expectations, but it does not include comparative data on booking rates between 2023 and 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the TSA project that the 2024 holiday travel season would be one of the busiest on record?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration (TSA) projected that the 2024 Thanksgiving holiday travel season would be one of the busiest on record. According to the sources, the TSA is expecting to screen 18.3 million people from Tuesday, November 26 to Monday, December 2, and TSA Administrator David Pekoske mentioned that the agency is ready to accommodate record passenger volumes, with the 10 busiest travel days in TSA's history all occurring in 2024[2][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have several months in 2024 set new all-time highs for US passenger enplanements?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nSeveral months in 2024 have set new all-time highs for U.S. passenger enplanements. Here are the specifics:\n\n- June 2024 saw new all-time highs for systemwide, domestic, and international enplanements[1].\n- July 2024 reached new all-time highs for systemwide, domestic, and international enplanements for the month of July[3].\n- August 2024 saw new all-time highs for systemwide, domestic, and international enplanements for the month of August[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the busiest travel days after Christmas in 2024 seen higher passenger volumes than in 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is not enough specific data to definitively compare the passenger volumes of the busiest travel days after Christmas in 2024 to those in 2023.\n\nWhile the sources do indicate that the holiday season in 2024 is expected to be one of the busiest on record, with increased passenger volumes anticipated[1][3][5], they do not provide a direct comparison of the post-Christmas travel days specifically between 2024 and 2023.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the busiest travel days after Christmas in 2024 have seen higher passenger volumes than in 2023 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has public confidence in avoiding airline delays and cancellations improved in 2024 compared to 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether public confidence in avoiding airline delays and cancellations has improved in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nThe sources provide data on flight delays and cancellations, as well as airline performance, but they do not specifically address changes in public confidence over the two years. The only mention of public confidence is from the 2024 Thanksgiving Travel Survey, which states that nearly 46% of American adults have little or no confidence in airlines being able to avoid excessive delays and cancellations this holiday season, but it does not provide a comparison to 2023[1].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did US airport passenger traffic in February 2024 increase by at least 6% compared to February 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, US airport passenger traffic in February 2024 did increase by at least 6% compared to February 2023.\n\n- According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), systemwide enplanements in February 2024 were up 8.6% from the same month in 2023[1].\n- Additionally, CoStar reported that passenger traffic in January and February 2024 was 6% higher than in 2023[2].\n- The International Air Transport Association (IATA) also noted that domestic demand in the US rose by 15.0% compared to February 2023[5].\n\nThese sources collectively indicate that the increase was indeed at least 6%.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the rate of airline cancellations in 2024 been lower than in 2023?\nANSWER: Yes, the rate of airline cancellations in 2024 has been lower than in 2023.\n\n- The year-to-date flight cancellation rate for 2024 was 1.6% as of August 2024, which is below the rates seen in 2023 and pre-pandemic levels[1].\n- For March 2024, the cancellation rate was 0.9%, lower than the 1.3% rate in March 2023 and the 2.0% rate in pre-pandemic March 2019[2].\n- For April 2024, the cancellation rate was 0.7%, lower than the 1.7% rate in April 2023 and the 2.4% rate in pre-pandemic April 2019[3].\n\nThese sources consistently show that the cancellation rates in 2024 have been lower than those in 2023.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Biden-Harris Administration implemented measures to optimize airline staffing in 2024?\nANSWER: YES;\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has implemented several measures to optimize airline staffing, particularly focusing on air traffic controllers and other aviation personnel. Here are some key points:\n\n- The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024, signed by President Biden on May 16, 2024, aims to address a shortage of 3,000 air traffic controllers by directing the FAA to implement improved staffing standards and to hire more inspectors, engineers, and technical specialists[1].\n- The FAA is actively working to hire and train new air traffic controllers, exceeding its hiring target of 1,800 in 2024 and aiming for 2,000 hires in the next year. They have also established a new Enhanced Air Traffic-Collegiate Training Initiative (AT-CTI) and are using tower simulator training systems to enhance training[2].\n\nThese efforts indicate a clear focus on optimizing airline staffing, particularly in the area of air traffic control.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did US airport passenger traffic in January 2024 increase by at least 6% compared to January 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the relevant information:\n\n- The CoStar article mentions that \"Volume in January and February 2024 was 6% higher than 2023 and 5% above the first two months of 2019\"[2].\n- Specifically for January, the FlightBI reports indicate that there was a year-over-year increase, but they do not provide a precise percentage increase for January alone. However, they do mention overall positive growth trends from January 2023 to January 2024[3][4].\n\nGiven the CoStar article's statement that the volume in January and February 2024 combined was 6% higher than the same period in 2023, and considering that January is part of this period, it can be inferred that January 2024 saw an increase, though the exact percentage for January alone is not explicitly stated. However, since the combined increase for January and February was 6%, it is reasonable to conclude that January 2024 also saw an increase, and it is likely that this increase was at least part of the overall 6% growth.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**  \nToday is November 29, 2024. The outcome will be known by the end of the week of December 25-31, 2024, or by January 7, 2025, at the latest. Therefore, there are approximately **8 days** left until the outcome is known.\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed:**  \nIf nothing changed from the trends observed up to November 29, 2024, the passenger volume for the week of December 25-31, 2024, would likely remain similar to or slightly higher than the 2023 figures. However, considering 2023 was the busiest travel year ever with 17,307,363 passengers, **the outcome would be \"No\"** if passenger volumes do not increase.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only about **2 days** left, the forecast would rely heavily on the most recent data and trends. Given the strong upward trends in passenger volumes leading up to this date, the forecast would lean towards an increase. **Forecast: 75%**\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith approximately **32 days** left, there is more time to account for potential changes in travel behavior, economic factors, or unforeseen events. However, the existing positive trends and administrative measures to optimize operations suggest continued growth. **Forecast: 80%**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe US airline passenger volume for the holiday week of December 25-31, 2024, is being assessed against the record-breaking figures of 2023. Early indicators from January and February 2024 show a 6% increase in passenger traffic compared to the previous year, with several months setting new all-time highs. August 2024 alone saw a 4.5% increase in enplanements. The TSA has projected one of the busiest holiday seasons on record, and lower cancellation rates coupled with improved airline staffing measures further support the likelihood of increased passenger volumes.\n\nWhile some subquestions remain unclear, the overarching trend points towards growth in passenger numbers. The anticipation of a busier holiday season, combined with proactive measures to handle increased traffic, suggests confidence in surpassing the 2023 figures. Even if minor uncertainties arise, the probability remains high due to the strong existing indicators.\n\n**Probability:** **80%**",
