If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nSpirit Airlines, a deep discount airline which has been unprofitable from an operating standpoint since the start of the 2020 pandemic, recently had a buyout from JetBlue rejected by antitrust regulators. As of Q2 2024 results it continues to face declining revenues and negative earnings and cash flows.Spirit AIrlines recently had to [extend the deadline](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/spirit-airlines-shares-tick-down-on-deadline-extension-to-complete-debt-renegotiations-c5e29f61?mod=mw_quote_news) of some of its debt due.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Spirit Airlines filing for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Financial Situation\nSpirit Airlines is facing significant financial challenges, including over $3 billion in debt and an 11th consecutive quarterly loss. The airline has not turned an annual profit since before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Debt Refinancing\nSpirit Airlines has recently extended its deadline to refinance more than $1 billion in debt until December 23, 2024. This extension has temporarily alleviated some of the immediate financial pressure and led to a surge in the company's stock price.\n\n## Liquidity\nDespite the financial struggles, Spirit Airlines has utilized a $300 million revolving credit facility and expects to end 2024 with over $1 billion in available liquidity. This liquidity could help the airline navigate its current financial difficulties.\n\n## Failed Merger\nThe failure of the merger with JetBlue, blocked by a federal judge due to antitrust concerns, has exacerbated Spirit Airlines' financial woes. This merger was seen as a potential solution to ease the airline's financial struggles.\n\n## Bankruptcy Speculation\nThere has been ongoing speculation about a potential bankruptcy filing, but as of now, Spirit Airlines has avoided this step. The company's recent actions, such as extending the debt refinancing deadline and utilizing credit facilities, suggest efforts to avoid bankruptcy.\n\n## Time to Resolution\nThe critical deadline for refinancing or extending notes is December 23, 2024. If Spirit Airlines can successfully refinance its debt or secure additional funding by this date, it may avoid bankruptcy. However, if it fails to do so, the likelihood of a bankruptcy filing increases.\n\nGiven these points, while Spirit Airlines has taken steps to delay a potential bankruptcy filing, the outcome is not certain. The airline's ability to refinance its debt and maintain sufficient liquidity will be crucial in determining whether it can avoid bankruptcy before January 1, 2025.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- The airline industry has seen several bankruptcies in the past, especially during times of financial stress.\n- The success rate of debt refinancing and restructuring in the airline industry can vary widely.\n\n### Superforecaster Relevant Details\n- The December 23, 2024, deadline for debt refinancing is a critical milestone.\n- The airline's liquidity position and ability to secure additional funding will be key factors.\n- Historical examples of airlines navigating similar financial challenges could provide insight into potential outcomes.\n\nBased on the available information, it is not possible to definitively answer whether Spirit Airlines will file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, as the outcome depends on several variables, including the success of its debt refinancing efforts and its ability to maintain sufficient liquidity.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Spirit Airlines successfully refinanced or extended any of its major debt obligations as of October 2023?\nANSWER: YES\n\nAs of October 2024, Spirit Airlines has successfully extended its debt refinancing program. The company reached an agreement to extend the debt refinancing deadline until December 23, 2023, which is the second extension of the original deadline. This extension applies to its major debt obligations, providing temporary relief to the airline.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Spirit Airlines facing significant debt obligations maturing before January 1, 2025?\nANSWER: YES\n\nSpirit Airlines is facing significant debt obligations that are set to mature before January 1, 2025. Specifically, the airline has senior secured notes due in 2025, and it has been in discussions to refinance or extend these notes, with a deadline now extended to December 23, 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 2023, has the proposed merger between Spirit Airlines and JetBlue been approved by antitrust regulators?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, the proposed merger between Spirit Airlines and JetBlue has not been approved by antitrust regulators. In fact, a U.S. District Court judge blocked the proposed merger in January 2024, and although the companies initially planned to appeal, they later agreed to terminate the merger agreement in March 2024 due to the unlikelihood of meeting the necessary regulatory approvals.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 2023, has Spirit Airlines made public statements expressing concerns about its ability to continue as a going concern?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, Spirit Airlines had not made explicit public statements expressing concerns about its ability to continue as a going concern in the sources provided. However, the company did discuss various challenges and financial difficulties.\n\n- In the third quarter 2023 results, Spirit Airlines mentioned softer demand, discounted fares, higher fuel prices, and other financial challenges, but they also expressed confidence in their ability to return to profitability and make necessary strategic shifts.\n- There was no direct statement in these sources indicating doubt about continuing as a going concern as of October 2023.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: As of October 2023, has Spirit Airlines reported consecutive quarterly losses since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic?\nANSWER: As of October 2023, Spirit Airlines has indeed reported consecutive quarterly losses that date back to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are the key points:\n\n- Spirit Airlines reported a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2021, and this trend of losses has continued.\n- The company has faced significant financial challenges since 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and these challenges have persisted.\n- Recent reports indicate that Spirit Airlines has experienced 11 consecutive quarterly losses, highlighting the ongoing financial struggles.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have other major U.S. airlines filed for bankruptcy within one year of experiencing similar financial situations?\nANSWER: Yes, other major U.S. airlines have filed for bankruptcy within a relatively short period of each other, often due to similar financial situations.\n\n- In 2002, United Airlines filed for bankruptcy, and US Airways followed with its first bankruptcy filing in the same year. US Airways filed again in September 2004.\n- On September 14, 2005, both Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines filed for bankruptcy, citing high fuel costs and other financial pressures.\n- American Airlines, after avoiding bankruptcy for several years, finally filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2011, due to ongoing financial struggles and the inability to reduce costs through other means.\n\nThese bankruptcies were often driven by common factors such as high fuel costs, pension obligations, labor contract issues, and increased competition, which affected multiple airlines simultaneously.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Spirit Airlines accumulated over $3 billion in debt as of October 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, as of October 2024, Spirit Airlines has accumulated over $3 billion in debt. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- \"Spirit Airlines has been struggling for four years and is facing an imminent deadline or it may declare bankruptcy. The company\u2019s stock has lost 90% of its value this year. Spirit\u2019s market value is less than $200 million and it has more than $3 billion in debt.\"\n- \"The low-cost carrier is currently saddled with over $3 billion in debt after failing to turn an annual profit since before the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n- \"It owes more than $3 billion in debt.\"\n\nWhile these sources are from October 2024, the context suggests that the debt accumulation has been ongoing and was already significant by the end of 2023. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Spirit Airlines had accumulated over $3 billion in debt as of October 2023.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the overall U.S. airline industry experiencing declining revenues in 2023?\nANSWER: No, the overall U.S. airline industry is not experiencing declining revenues in 2023. According to the sources, the industry saw significant growth and recovery in 2023.\n\n- The U.S. mainline passenger airline industry recorded strong revenue and operating profitability in 2023, with passenger traffic and capacity growing significantly compared to 2022.\n- The industry's operating revenues were higher than expected, with the global airline industry revenues for 2023 reaching $896 billion, which is $93 billion higher than the previous forecast.\n- The U.S. passenger airlines saw their revenues increase, driven by strong demand for air travel, particularly in premium leisure and international travel segments.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any indications from financial analysts predicting a potential bankruptcy filing by Spirit Airlines before 2025?\nANSWER: Yes, there are indications from financial analysts and reports suggesting a potential bankruptcy filing by Spirit Airlines before 2025.\n\n- Spirit Airlines is facing significant financial challenges, including over $3 billion in debt and a need to refinance or extend its debt by December 23, 2024, to avoid potential bankruptcy.\n- Wall Street analysts have speculated that if Spirit is unable to refinance or extend its debt, bankruptcy could be a possibility. The airline is in active discussions with bondholders over the terms of a potential bankruptcy filing.\n- The airline's financial struggles, including operating losses since the pandemic and recent financial results, have led analysts to express concerns about its ability to avoid bankruptcy.\n\nThese points indicate that financial analysts are indeed considering the possibility of a bankruptcy filing by Spirit Airlines before 2025.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Spirit Airlines have over $1 billion in available liquidity as of October 2023?\nANSWER: No, Spirit Airlines does not have over $1 billion in available liquidity as of October 2023, based on the provided sources.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter 2023, Spirit Airlines had $1.3 billion in total liquidity, but this figure had narrowed by the end of the first quarter of 2024. However, the specific liquidity as of October 2023 is not directly stated in the sources.\n\nHowever, considering the liquidity at the end of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, it is reasonable to infer that the liquidity in October 2023 would be close to or slightly less than the $1.3 billion reported at the end of 2023. Here are the relevant points:\n\n- At the end of the fourth quarter 2023, Spirit had $1.3 billion in total liquidity.\n- By the end of the first quarter 2024, this had narrowed to $1.2 billion.\n\nGiven this trend, it is likely that in October 2023, the liquidity would be around or slightly below $1.3 billion, but the exact figure for October is not provided.\n\nThus, the answer is **NO**, based on the lack of specific data for October 2023 and the general trend of liquidity levels around that time.", "comment": "(a) **Time left until outcome is known**: There are approximately 70 days remaining until January 1, 2025.\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed**: If nothing changed, Spirit Airlines would face a critical debt refinancing deadline on **December 23, 2024**. Failure to refinance or extend their debt by this date would significantly increase the likelihood of filing for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left**: With only about 17 days remaining, the probability of Spirit Airlines filing for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025, would be **around 10%**, as it's less likely for such proceedings to unfold rapidly within that short period.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left**: If there were approximately 280 days left, the probability would increase to **about 50%**, providing more time for financial deterioration and increasing the chance of bankruptcy before the deadline.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale**:\n\nSpirit Airlines is currently facing significant financial challenges:\n\n- **Debt Obligations**: The airline has over **$3 billion in debt** and has extended its debt refinancing deadline to **December 23, 2024**. This date is crucial; failure to refinance or further extend debt obligations could lead to bankruptcy.\n  \n- **Financial Performance**: Spirit has reported **11 consecutive quarterly losses** since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting ongoing operational struggles.\n\n- **Liquidity**: Despite these challenges, Spirit expects to end 2024 with over **$1 billion in available liquidity**, which may help navigate immediate financial pressures.\n\n- **Failed Merger**: The blocked merger with JetBlue removed a potential avenue for financial relief, exacerbating Spirit's challenges.\n\n**Considerations**:\n\n- **Historical Precedent**: Other major U.S. airlines have filed for bankruptcy under similar circumstances, sometimes within a year of facing comparable financial stress.\n  \n- **Critical Deadline**: The December 23 deadline is just days before January 1, 2025. If refinancing fails, bankruptcy proceedings could be initiated swiftly.\n\n- **Time Constraints**: The limited time frame (70 days) reduces the window for both deterioration and rescue efforts. While bankruptcy is possible, it's not guaranteed within this period.\n\n- **Efforts to Avoid Bankruptcy**: Companies typically strive to avoid bankruptcy through negotiations, asset sales, or seeking additional financing.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nBalancing these factors, there is a **moderate probability** that Spirit Airlines will file for bankruptcy before January 1, 2025. The critical debt refinancing deadline and historical patterns in the airline industry suggest a tangible risk. However, the company's significant liquidity and potential for last-minute solutions temper this likelihood.\n\n**Probability: 30%**", "probability": 30}
