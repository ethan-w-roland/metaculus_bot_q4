    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Montana voters approve CI-128, which would add the right to abortion to the state's constitution?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-28\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Montana CI-128 is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reporting. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Montana CI-128, Right to Abortion Initiative (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Montana_CI-128,_Right_to_Abortion_Initiative_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo predict whether Montana voters will approve Constitutional Initiative 128 (CI-128), which aims to amend the Montana Constitution to include the right to make decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion, here are some key points and contextual information:\n\n## Current Legal Status\nAbortion is currently legal in Montana until fetal viability, based on a 1999 Montana Supreme Court decision in *Armstrong v. State* that interpreted the state constitution's right to privacy to include the right to abortion.\n\n## Initiative Details\nCI-128 would explicitly enshrine the right to abortion in the Montana Constitution, prohibiting the government from denying or burdening this right before fetal viability, except when medically indicated to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient.\n\n## Public Opinion and Debate\nThe initiative has sparked significant debate among voters, with strong opinions on both sides. Supporters argue that it is necessary to protect reproductive rights in the face of increasing restrictions, while opponents believe it goes too far and could lead to unchecked access to abortion.\n\n## Previous Voting Patterns\nIn 2022, Montana voters rejected LR-131, a measure that would have required medical care for infants born alive after an abortion or other procedures. This rejection suggests that voters may be cautious about measures that significantly alter abortion laws, although the context and specifics of each measure differ.\n\n## Campaign Finance\nSupporters of CI-128 have raised substantially more funds ($16.4 million) compared to opponents (just under $200,000), which could indicate stronger organizational and financial backing for the initiative.\n\n## State and National Context\nThe initiative is part of a broader national trend, with multiple states having abortion-related measures on their 2024 ballots. This national context may influence voter attitudes and engagement.\n\n## Information and Voter Education\nThere are concerns about the accuracy and reliability of voter information, particularly from the Montana Secretary of State's office, which could impact voter decision-making.\n\nGiven these factors, it is not immediately clear whether Montana voters will approve CI-128. The outcome will depend on various factors, including voter turnout, the effectiveness of campaign messaging, and the overall political climate in Montana.\n\n### Base Rates\n- Previous abortion-related measures in Montana have shown mixed results, indicating that voter sentiment can be divided.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The initiative will be decided on November 5, 2024, providing a clear timeline for resolution.\n\n### Current State of the World\n- The national debate on abortion rights is highly polarized, which could influence local voting decisions.\n\n### Reference Classes\n- Other states with similar ballot measures can serve as reference points, but local factors and previous voting patterns in Montana are crucial.\n\n### Special Considerations\n- The significant financial disparity between supporters and opponents, as well as the current legal status of abortion in Montana, are important factors to consider.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Montana voters reject a pro-life measure in the 2022 election?\nANSWER: YES\n\nIn the 2022 election, Montana voters rejected a ballot measure known as Legislative Referendum 131 (LR-131), which would have declared an embryo or fetus a legal person entitled to medical care if they were “born alive” at any stage of development, including after attempted abortions. The measure was opposed by about 53% of the voters.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there recent polls indicating that a majority of Montana voters support CI-128?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of recent polls indicating the level of support for CI-128 among Montana voters. The sources discuss the initiative, its implications, and the campaigns for and against it, but they do not provide any specific polling data.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Montana generally considered a conservative-leaning state in national elections?\nANSWER: Yes, Montana is generally considered a conservative-leaning state in national elections. Here are some key points that support this:\n\n- Montana has traditionally voted Republican in presidential elections, with former President Trump winning the state by significant margins in both 2016 and 2020.\n- The state's legislative and executive branches are currently controlled by Republicans, indicating a strong conservative presence.\n- Recent trends and voter migration patterns, such as the influx of center-right voters from other states, have further shifted the state's political landscape in a conservative direction.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest that Montana leans conservative in national elections.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are major Montana political figures or organizations actively opposing CI-128?\nANSWER: Yes, major Montana political figures and organizations are actively opposing Constitutional Initiative 128 (CI-128).\n\n- Various conservative Christian policy groups, such as the Montana Family Foundation and the Montana Catholic Conference, are actively campaigning against CI-128, leveraging their grassroots networks and faith-based messaging to oppose the initiative.\n- Pastors and priests are also involved in rallying their congregations to vote against CI-128, emphasizing the initiative's potential impact on abortion laws and other social issues.\n- The Gallatin County Republicans have expressed strong opposition to CI-128, highlighting concerns about its impact on abortion laws and the well-being of women and children.\n\nThese efforts indicate significant opposition from various segments of Montana's political and social landscape.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have other states recently approved constitutional amendments protecting abortion rights?\nANSWER: Yes, other states have recently approved constitutional amendments protecting abortion rights. Since the Supreme Court’s *Dobbs* decision overturning *Roe v. Wade*, voters in several states have approved measures to protect abortion rights in their state constitutions.\n\n- In California, Michigan, Ohio, and Vermont, measures amending the state constitution to protect the right to abortion were approved by voters.\n- Additionally, voters in Kansas and Kentucky rejected measures that sought to curtail the right to abortion, effectively protecting existing abortion rights in those states.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is abortion currently legal in Montana up to the point of fetal viability?\nANSWER: Yes, abortion is currently legal in Montana up to the point of fetal viability.\n\nThis is confirmed by multiple sources:\n- Montana CI-128 explains that abortion is currently legal until fetal viability, and this right is protected under the state's right to privacy provision.\n- The current law and court precedents, including the 1999 Armstrong decision, uphold that abortion is legal in Montana until the point of fetal viability.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous abortion-related ballot measures in Montana been approved by voters?\nANSWER: Previous abortion-related ballot measures in Montana have had mixed outcomes, but there are instances where voters have approved or rejected such measures.\n\n- In 2022, Montana voters rejected Legislative Referendum 131, which would have established penalties if a health care provider failed to provide medical care to an infant born alive, including after an abortion. This measure was rejected with 52.55% of voters in favor and 47.45% opposed, although the majority voted in favor, it was still considered a rejection since it did not meet the necessary threshold for passage in the context of the question asked.\n\n- In 2012, voters approved Legislative Referendum 120, which required notification of a parent or legal guardian of a pregnant minor under 16 years old at least 48 hours before performing an abortion. This measure was approved with 70.55% of voters in favor and 29.45% opposed.\n\nTherefore, while not all abortion-related measures have been approved, there have been instances where voters have supported such measures.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the national debate on abortion influencing voter attitudes in Montana?\nANSWER: The national debate on abortion is indeed influencing voter attitudes in Montana. Here are several points that support this conclusion:\n\n1. **National Context and State Response**: The overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 has led to a heightened national debate on abortion, and this has had a direct impact on Montana. Abortion rights advocates in Montana are pushing for Constitutional Initiative 128 (CI-128) to protect abortion rights, partly in response to the national landscape and the actions of other states.\n\n2. **Comparison with Other States**: The debate in Montana is mirrored in other states where similar ballot measures are being considered. The success of abortion rights advocates in other states since the overturning of Roe v. Wade is cited as a context for the current debate in Montana.\n\n3. **Legislative Actions and Voter Reactions**: Montana lawmakers have passed anti-abortion bills despite voter rejection of similar measures in the past, which has fueled the current debate. This back-and-forth between legislative actions and voter opinions reflects the broader national tensions around abortion.\n\n4. **Campaign Messaging and Funding**: The campaign for CI-128 is heavily influenced by national trends and funding. Advocates and opponents are using arguments and resources that reflect the broader national debate on abortion, including significant funding from out-of-state groups.\n\nGiven these points, it is clear that the national debate on abortion is shaping voter attitudes and the ongoing discussion in Montana.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have supporters of CI-128 raised significantly more campaign funds than opponents?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nSupporters of CI-128, led by the committee Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights, have raised significantly more campaign funds than the opponents. According to the sources, the supporters have raised nearly $16.5 million in contributions, while the opponents, primarily through the Montana Life Defense Fund and Defend Life, have reported only about $191,362 in contributions. This significant disparity in fundraising is clearly documented in the campaign finance data.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is voter turnout in Montana expected to be higher than average in the 2024 general election?\nANSWER: Based on the available sources, there are indications that suggest voter turnout in Montana for the 2024 general election could be higher than average, although the final outcome is not certain.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Montana has consistently had one of the highest voter turnout rates in the nation, as noted by the Montana Secretary of State website.\n\n2. **Previous Election Trends**: The 2020 general election in Montana saw an exceptionally high turnout, with 81% of registered voters participating, which was the highest since 1972.\n\n3. **Current Election Season**: Despite lower turnout in the 2024 primary elections, projections suggest that the general election could see an increase in voter participation due to highly contested races.\n\n4. **Absentee Ballots**: As of two weeks before the election, a significant percentage of absentee ballots had already been returned, indicating active voter engagement.\n\nGiven these points, it is reasonable to expect that voter turnout in Montana for the 2024 general election could be higher than average.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** 8 days (from October 28, 2024, to November 5, 2024).\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:** If nothing changed, the measure would likely be approved due to strong campaign support and recent voting patterns that favor abortion rights.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:** With only 2 days left, I would forecast a slightly higher probability of approval, as there would be minimal time for any significant shifts in public opinion.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4x the time left:** With 32 days left, I would forecast a slightly lower probability of approval, accounting for additional time for opposition campaigns to potentially influence voters.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Public Opinion and Voting Patterns:**\n  - In 2022, Montana voters **rejected** LR-131, a pro-life measure, indicating a willingness to oppose restrictive abortion laws.\n  - Historically, Montana has shown a nuanced approach to abortion-related measures, sometimes approving and other times rejecting them.\n\n- **Campaign Financing:**\n  - Supporters of CI-128 have raised **significantly more funds** (~$16.5 million) than opponents (~$191,000).\n  - The financial advantage may lead to more effective campaigning and voter outreach for the measure.\n\n- **State Political Leanings:**\n  - Montana is generally a **conservative-leaning** state in national elections.\n  - However, the state's libertarian values emphasize individual rights and privacy, which can translate into support for reproductive rights.\n\n- **National Context:**\n  - The **national debate on abortion** is influencing voter attitudes in Montana.\n  - Other states have recently approved constitutional amendments protecting abortion rights.\n  - Voters may be motivated by actions in other states and the overall national climate.\n\n- **Voter Turnout:**\n  - Voter turnout in Montana is expected to be **higher than average** in the 2024 general election.\n  - Higher turnout can benefit ballot measures that have strong grassroots support and resonate with a broader electorate.\n\n- **Absence of Recent Polls:**\n  - There is a lack of recent polling data on CI-128, adding uncertainty to the forecast.\n  - Without polling data, reliance is placed on other indicators like campaign financing and previous voting behavior.\n\n- **Opposition Factors:**\n  - Major political figures and organizations in Montana are **actively opposing** CI-128.\n  - The opposition might influence some voters, but their financial disadvantage could limit their reach.\n\n- **Time Factors:**\n  - With only 8 days left until the election, significant shifts in public opinion are less likely.\n  - Additional time (as in 4x the current time) could allow opposition efforts to gain traction.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 65%**",
