    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the World Health Organization prequalify moxidectin before 2025?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-01\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) adds moxidectin to its prequalification (PQ) list, according to official WHO announcements or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions). If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nNote that this question resolves **Yes** only if moxidectin achieves PQ approval for the treatment of onchocerciasis. If moxidectin achieves PQ approval for another indication, but not onchocerciasis, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAlthough Medicines Development for Global Health (MDGH) is developing moxidectin for potential WHO PQ, this question resolves regardless of which entity achieves the PQ.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nIn June 2024, GiveWell made a $637,549 grant to [Medicines Development for Global Health](https://www.medicinesdevelopment.com/) (MDGH), a not-for-profit pharmaceutical organization focused on developing medicines for neglected diseases in low- and middle-income countries, to complete the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) prequalification process for moxidectin.\n\nAccording to [the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis):\n\n>Onchocerciasis, commonly known as “river blindness”, is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. It is transmitted to humans through exposure to repeated bites of infected blackflies of the genus Simulium. Symptoms include severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions, and visual impairment, including permanent blindness. More than 99% of infected people live in 31 African countries. The disease also exists in some foci in two countries in Latin America (the Yanomani area in Brazil and Venezuela) and Yemen.\n\nAs of September 2024, the WHO [recommends](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis) annual ivermectin treatments for 10-15 years to treat onchocerciasis. Ivermectin works by killing the larval worms or microfilariae and by temporarily stopping the adult female worms from producing more.\n\nHowever, ivermectin has some limitations, according to the [WHO](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/367431/9789240071469-eng.pdf), including resistance in some places and adverse reactions among people who also have Loa loa infection. According to the WHO, moxidectin is a safe and effective alternative that is effective for longer and has been shown in trials to reduce skin microfilariae more than in people treated with ivermectin. It may also be a more cost-saving treatment.\n\nIn 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [approved](https://tdr.who.int/activities/moxidectin-a-new-drug-for-ntds) moxidectin for treatment of onchocerciasis in individuals 12 years and older, making it the first new drug for onchocerciasis to be approved in the US in 20 years and worldwide in 30 years. \n\nHowever, the WHO has [unexpectedly required](https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/priority-review-vouchers) extensive extra clinical trials for moxidectin, casting its near term WHO prequalification (PQ) status into a level of uncertainty. PQ status [would help](https://www.medicinesdevelopment.com/our-work/medicines) get the medicine approved and licensed for usage in many countries. In its internal forecasting, GiveWell has assigned a 80% likelihood of moxidectin being prequalified before 2027.\n\nAccording to the [Global Health Council](https://globalhealth.org/member-spotlight-medicines-development-for-global-health/):\n\n>Medicines Development for Global Health (MDGH) is an independent biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of affordable medicines for the people who need them most. MDGH is a not-for-profit company that uses all funds in excess of running costs to develop medicines that address important unmet medical needs but may have limited commercial opportunities. \n\n>In June 2018, the FDA approved moxidectin for the treatment of the Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness), a devastating and debilitating microfilarial disease that causes intense itching, severe dermatitis and skin depigmentation. As the disease progresses it can also cause blindness, and this condition is the second-most common cause of infectious blindness in the world. 200 million people are estimated to be at risk from this disease, and its elimination is a longstanding goal for the WHO.\n\nSee Also:\n\n- Kura et al. (2023) - [Can mass drug administration of moxidectin accelerate onchocerciasis elimination in Africa?](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.2022.0277) (PDF)\n- [Prequalification of medicines by WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/prequalification-of-medicines-by-who)\n- Global Health Council's member spotlight page for [Medicines Development for Global Health](https://globalhealth.org/member-spotlight-medicines-development-for-global-health/), Moxidectin's current license holder in the US.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nBased on the information available, moxidectin has already been through significant regulatory and approval processes. Here are some key points:\n\n- Moxidectin was registered in 2018 for the treatment of onchocerciasis in individuals aged 12 years and older.\n- The US FDA approved an 8 mg moxidectin dose for the treatment of onchocerciasis, and the drug has been licensed for use in endemic countries.\n\nGiven that moxidectin has already received regulatory approval from the US FDA and is being used in treatment programs, it is highly likely that the World Health Organization (WHO) has already prequalified moxidectin or has facilitated its registration in endemic countries through other mechanisms such as a positive 'Scientific Opinion' from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).\n\nTherefore, the question of whether the WHO will prequalify moxidectin before 2025 can be answered in the affirmative, as the necessary prequalification or equivalent regulatory approvals have already been achieved.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has moxidectin been approved for onchocerciasis treatment by regulatory agencies other than the US FDA?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not explicitly state that moxidectin has been approved for the treatment of onchocerciasis by regulatory agencies other than the US FDA. While they detail the FDA approval and ongoing efforts to expand its use, they do not mention approvals from other regulatory agencies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the WHO announced any expected timelines for prequalifying moxidectin for onchocerciasis?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specify any announcements from the World Health Organization (WHO) regarding expected timelines for prequalifying moxidectin for onchocerciasis. The sources discuss the FDA approval, ongoing studies, and the development process, but they do not mention any specific timelines for WHO prequalification.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Medicines Development for Global Health submitted all necessary documentation to the WHO for moxidectin’s prequalification?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether Medicines Development for Global Health (MDGH) has submitted all necessary documentation to the World Health Organization (WHO) for moxidectin’s prequalification.\n\nWhile the sources indicate that MDGH has been working with the WHO to support the necessary steps for national registrations and inclusion in the list of WHO prequalified medicines, they do not explicitly state that all the necessary documentation has been submitted for prequalification. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nUNCLEAR\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the WHO ever prequalified a medication for onchocerciasis within a two-month timeframe after receiving all required data?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not specify the exact timeframe for WHO prequalification of a medication for onchocerciasis after receiving all required data. While they discuss various aspects of drug approvals, prequalification, and the processes involved, they do not provide the specific information needed to answer whether the WHO has prequalified a medication for onchocerciasis within a two-month timeframe.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does the WHO require more than two months to complete the prequalification process after all documentation is submitted?\nANSWER: Yes, the WHO typically requires more than two months to complete the prequalification process after all documentation is submitted.\n\n- The target timeline for a full assessment is generally 270 calendar days, and for an abridged assessment, it is 100 calendar days.\n- Even in the most optimal scenarios, such as when the data presented are complete and demonstrate that the product meets all required standards, the process can still take longer than two months. For example, the minimum timeframe mentioned for a complete process is around three months, but this is under ideal conditions.\n\nTherefore, the process generally exceeds two months.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the World Health Organization prequalified moxidectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis as of November 1, 2024?\nANSWER: As of November 1, 2024, the sources provided do not explicitly state that the World Health Organization (WHO) has prequalified moxidectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis. However, they do mention several key points:\n\n- Moxidectin has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of onchocerciasis in individuals 12 years and older.\n- The WHO/TDR has been involved in the clinical development and studies of moxidectin, and there are ongoing efforts to provide additional data to inform WHO guidelines and country policies.\n\nGiven that the sources do not explicitly confirm WHO prequalification, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any known delays or obstacles in the WHO’s prequalification process for moxidectin?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information directly addressing delays or obstacles in the WHO’s prequalification process for moxidectin. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- The sources discuss the general process and potential delays in the WHO prequalification program, such as missing materials, the need for additional information, and inspection timelines.\n- However, these sources do not specifically mention moxidectin or any unique challenges related to its prequalification.\n- The information about moxidectin in the sources is more focused on its development, approval, and use rather than the prequalification process itself.\n\nGiven this, the answer to whether there are known delays or obstacles in the WHO’s prequalification process specifically for moxidectin is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is moxidectin currently being used to treat onchocerciasis in endemic countries without WHO prequalification?\nANSWER: Moxidectin is being considered and tested for use in endemic countries, but the current status of its implementation without WHO prequalification is not explicitly clear from the provided sources.\n\nHowever, it is mentioned that some onchocerciasis endemic countries and non-governmental organizations (NGDOs) are planning moxidectin pilot implementation projects to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in programmatic settings.\n\nSince moxidectin has been approved by the US FDA in 2018 for the treatment of onchocerciasis in individuals aged 12 years and older, and given that pilot implementation projects are underway, it suggests that moxidectin could be in the process of being used in some form, even if not yet widely implemented or prequalified by WHO.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the additional clinical trials required by the WHO for moxidectin’s prequalification been completed?\nANSWER: The information provided does not explicitly state that all additional clinical trials required by the WHO for moxidectin’s prequalification have been completed. Here are the key points:\n\n- The FDA approved moxidectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis based on a significant clinical trial (NCT00790998).\n- The WHO and other organizations are continuing to work on additional studies to inform WHO guidelines and country policies, including developing a pediatric formulation.\n- There is ongoing research and evaluation, such as the study to extend the indication for moxidectin and other uses, but it does not confirm the completion of all required trials for prequalification.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR** as the sources do not provide definitive information on the completion of all additional clinical trials required for WHO prequalification.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Medicines Development for Global Health received sufficient funding to complete the WHO prequalification process for moxidectin?\nANSWER: Yes, Medicines Development for Global Health (MDGH) has received sufficient funding to support the various stages of moxidectin's development, including the processes necessary for WHO prequalification.\n\n- MDGH leveraged the prospect of a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to raise funding for activities required for a New Drug Application (NDA) to the US FDA, which is a stringent regulatory authority whose approval facilitates WHO prequalification.\n- The company received significant funding from various sources, including the Global Health Investment Fund (GHIF), the Australian Government, the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trial Partnership (EDCTP), and other grants, which have supported the clinical development, regulatory approvals, and other necessary steps for moxidectin.\n- The U.S. FDA approved moxidectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis in 2018, which is a critical step towards WHO prequalification.\n\nThese funding sources and regulatory approvals indicate that MDGH has had the necessary resources to complete the WHO prequalification process for moxidectin.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\nThere are 2 months remaining until January 1, 2025. The question will resolve in 2 months.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\nIf nothing changed between now (November 1, 2024) and January 1, 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) would not prequalify moxidectin for the treatment of onchocerciasis. Therefore, the outcome would be **No**.\n\n---\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\nWith only 0.5 months (approximately 15 days) left until the resolution date, the probability of WHO prequalifying moxidectin would be even lower, considering the typical timelines for the prequalification process. My forecast would be **1%** probability of a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\n---\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left:**\n\nIf there were 8 months left (extending the deadline to July 1, 2025), the probability would increase due to the additional time for the necessary processes. My forecast in this scenario would be **20%** probability of a \"Yes\" outcome.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nMoxidectin is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 for the treatment of onchocerciasis (river blindness) in individuals aged 12 years and older. Despite FDA approval, moxidectin has not yet been prequalified by the WHO for this indication.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n1. **WHO Prequalification Process Timelines:**\n\n   - The WHO prequalification (PQ) process typically takes between 100 to 270 days, depending on whether it's an abridged or full assessment.\n   - Even under optimal conditions, the process generally exceeds 2 months.\n   - As of November 1, 2024, there is no public evidence that MDGH has completed all the necessary steps or that the WHO is in the final stages of prequalifying moxidectin.\n\n2. **Additional Clinical Trials and Data Requirements:**\n\n   - The WHO has unexpectedly required extensive extra clinical trials for moxidectin.\n   - It is unclear whether these additional trials have been completed and whether the data have been submitted to the WHO.\n   - Without the completion of these trials and submission of data, the PQ process cannot advance.\n\n3. **Funding and Support:**\n\n   - GiveWell awarded a grant in June 2024 to MDGH to support the completion of the WHO PQ process.\n   - While this funding is a positive step, the PQ process involves rigorous evaluations that take time.\n\n4. **Current Status and Lack of Announcements:**\n\n   - As of November 1, 2024, there have been no official announcements from the WHO regarding the prequalification of moxidectin.\n   - No information suggests that moxidectin is on the verge of being prequalified within the next 2 months.\n\n5. **Historical Precedent and Regulatory Processes:**\n\n   - Regulatory and prequalification processes tend to be lengthy due to the need for thorough review to ensure safety and efficacy.\n   - Expedited processes are rare and typically reserved for emergency situations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the limited time remaining, the typical duration of the WHO PQ process, and the lack of indications that prequalification is imminent, the probability that the WHO will prequalify moxidectin for onchocerciasis before January 1, 2025, is low.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
