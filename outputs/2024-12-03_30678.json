    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the average daily temperature for December 2024 recorded by the Barrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station (on the Arctic coast of Alaska) exceed the 1945-2023 average for December by ≥4 degrees F?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-03\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the average daily temperature for December 2024 recorded by the Barrow/Port Rogers National Weather Service weather station in Alaska exceeds the 1945-2023 average for December by ≥4 degrees Fahrenheit. Specifically, it will be the figure for December 2024 under \"Average Daily Temperature (high+low)/2 [F]\" listed at [this webpage](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/sites/monthlysum.php?station=PABR&network=AK_ASOS) by Iowa Environmental Mesonet.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that Iowa Environmental Mesonet is the only data provider that will be used for resolution. The specific link to the webpage within the resolution source's website is provided for convenience, but if the resolution data is at a different page at the resolution source, then that page will be used for resolution.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to the [Arctic Council](https://arctic-council.org/explore/topics/climate/), \"The temperatures in the Arctic continue to rise at three times the global annual average, driving many of the changes underway in the Arctic. Most prominently, snow and ice are melting at an increasing rate. This impacts both local ecosystems and the global climate system. It contributes to rising sea levels, and is likely to provoke extreme temperature events beyond the Arctic. The effects of a shifting Arctic climate are felt across the high latitudes and beyond – with global environmental, economic, and social implications.\"\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether the average daily temperature for December 2024 in Barrow, Alaska, will exceed the 1945-2023 average by ≥4 degrees F, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Historical Temperature Averages\n- The average temperature in December for Barrow, Alaska, is typically very cold. Historical data indicate average daytime maximum temperatures around -21°C (-6°F) and nighttime minimum temperatures around -27°C (-17°F)[1][2][4].\n\n## Current Forecast and Trends\n- The long-range weather forecast for December 2024 suggests that temperatures will be very cold, with periods of snowstorms and flurries. The forecast does not indicate any significant warming trend; instead, it suggests temperatures will be \"very cold\" and \"bitter cold\" during various parts of the month[3].\n- The Old Farmer's Almanac predicts that winter 2024-2025 will be \"not so cold as usual\" but still coldest in December and early January, with precipitation below normal. However, this does not imply a significant deviation from historical averages by ≥4 degrees F[3].\n\n## Polar Night Conditions\n- Barrow experiences polar night in December, which means the sun remains below the horizon for the entire month. This condition contributes to the extremely cold temperatures and does not suggest any unusual warming[1][4].\n\n## Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Historically, temperature deviations of ≥4 degrees F above the average are rare in such a cold and stable climate as Barrow's. The climate is characterized by extreme cold, and significant deviations from the mean are not common[2][4].\n\nGiven these points, it is unlikely that the average daily temperature for December 2024 will exceed the 1945-2023 average by ≥4 degrees F. The forecasts and historical data do not indicate any conditions that would lead to such a significant warming. However, without real-time data from December 2024, this cannot be definitively answered as a yes or no, but the likelihood based on current information is low.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have the daily temperatures in Barrow, Alaska, for December 2024 been recorded and are available?\nANSWER: No, the daily temperatures in Barrow, Alaska, for December 2024 have not been recorded and are not available. The sources provided offer forecasted or average weather conditions for December, but they do not include actual recorded temperatures for the specific month of December 2024[1][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant reductions in sea ice around Barrow, Alaska, in December 2024 compared to historical data?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not include specific data or analyses for sea ice conditions around Barrow, Alaska, in December 2024. The most recent information provided is up to September 2024, and there is no mention of December 2024 sea ice conditions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have average daily temperatures in Barrow, Alaska, for December 2024 been at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the 1945-2023 average?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data comparing the average daily temperatures for December 2024 to the historical average from 1945-2023.\n\nThe sources provide average temperature data for December in Barrow, Alaska, but they do not include a direct comparison to the 1945-2023 average. For example, sources [1], [3], and [4] describe the typical weather conditions and average temperatures for December, but they do not provide historical averages or comparisons to previous years.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have weather forecasts for December 2024 predicted unusually high temperatures for Barrow, Alaska?\nANSWER: No, the weather forecasts for December 2024 have not predicted unusually high temperatures for Barrow, Alaska. Here are the key points from the sources:\n\n- Daytime temperatures in December are expected to be around -21°C (or -6°F), and nighttime temperatures can drop to as low as -27°C (or -17°F)[1][2][4].\n- The climate is described as very cold, with average temperatures well below freezing[2][4].\n- There are no indications of temperatures being above normal or unusually high for the month of December in Barrow, Alaska[1][2][3].\n\nThese forecasts align with the typical cold winter conditions expected in Barrow during December.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any active El Niño or La Niña conditions affecting weather patterns in December 2024?\nANSWER: As of the latest updates, there are no active El Niño or La Niña conditions yet, but there is a high probability of La Niña emerging soon.\n\n- Current conditions as of mid-November 2024 are still ENSO-neutral[2][3][4].\n- However, there is a significant chance (57% to 60%) of La Niña emerging in the October-December 2024 period and persisting through January-March 2025[2][4][5].\n\nTherefore, as of December 2024, it is likely that La Niña conditions may be emerging or have just begun, but they are not yet confirmed as active.\n\n**UNCLEAR** (since the transition to La Niña is forecasted but not yet confirmed as active in December 2024).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the duration or intensity of polar night conditions in Barrow, Alaska, been altered in December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that the duration or intensity of polar night conditions in Utqiagvik (formerly known as Barrow), Alaska, has been altered in December 2024. The sources describe the typical duration and characteristics of polar night in this region, which remains consistent with previous years.\n\n- The polar night in Utqiagvik typically lasts from November 18 to January 22, and this pattern is expected to continue in 2024[3][4].\n- There is no mention of any changes or anomalies in the duration or intensity of polar night for December 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there an ongoing warming trend in the Arctic region in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe sources clearly indicate an ongoing warming trend in the Arctic region in 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- Arctic sea ice retreated to near-historic lows in the summer of 2024, continuing a decades-long trend of shrinking and thinning ice cover[1][2].\n- The Arctic's average temperature has risen at a rate of almost four times the global average, with temperatures in the Arctic increasing significantly more than elsewhere on Earth[1][2][5].\n- The ice thickness in the central Arctic has decreased significantly, from 8.8 feet (2.7 meters) in 1980 to 4.2 feet (1.3 meters) in 2024, indicating a substantial loss of the oldest, thickest ice[1][2].\n- The warming trend is further exacerbated by the ice-albedo feedback, where the loss of sea ice leads to more ocean water being exposed, which absorbs more sunlight and contributes to further warming[1][2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any recent climate reports indicating accelerated warming in Barrow, Alaska, during December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, there is no indication of accelerated warming in Barrow, Alaska, during December 2024. Here are the key points:\n\n- The sources describe December 2024 in Barrow as extremely cold, with daytime temperatures around -21°C and nighttime temperatures around -27°C[1][2][4].\n- The long-range weather forecast and climate data do not suggest any unusual warming trends for December 2024. Instead, they indicate that the period will be very cold, with temperatures below average in some cases[1][2][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are current greenhouse gas emission levels contributing to increased temperatures in the Arctic in 2024?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nThe sources provided clearly indicate that current greenhouse gas emission levels are contributing to increased temperatures in the Arctic in 2024.\n\n- The Arctic is warming at three to four times the global average, and this rapid warming is attributed to rising air and sea temperatures, which are driven by global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions[1][3][5].\n- Record-high temperatures in the Arctic, including northern Norway, Lapland, and Murmansk, are linked to persistent heat domes and the overall trend of Arctic amplification due to climate change[5].\n- The melting of sea ice, which is exacerbated by greenhouse gas emissions, leads to an ice-albedo feedback where open ocean water absorbs more sunlight, further increasing water temperatures and delaying sea ice growth[2][3].\n\nThese points collectively support the conclusion that current greenhouse gas emission levels are a significant factor in the increased temperatures observed in the Arctic in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any historical instances of Barrow, Alaska, experiencing a ≥4 degrees Fahrenheit increase in average daily December temperatures since 1945?\nANSWER: To determine if there have been any historical instances of Barrow, Alaska, experiencing a ≥4 degrees Fahrenheit increase in average daily December temperatures since 1945, we need to look at the historical temperature data.\n\n1. **Historical Temperature Data**: The sources provide some insights into the temperature variations in Barrow, Alaska. For instance, the average December temperatures are typically very cold, with daily high temperatures ranging from 0°F to -4°F[1].\n\n2. **Specific Years**: The source from Extreme Weather Watch mentions that 2017 was the warmest December in the history of Barrow, Alaska, with an average daily high temperature of 10.9°F and an average low of 0.5°F. This is significantly warmer than the usual averages[5].\n\n3. **Comparison**: To see if there was a ≥4°F increase, we need to compare the average temperatures of 2017 to the long-term averages. Given that the usual average daily high temperature is around 0°F to -4°F, the 2017 average of 10.9°F represents a significant increase, well above the 4°F threshold[1][5].\n\nTherefore, based on the data from 2017, there has indeed been a historical instance of Barrow, Alaska, experiencing a ≥4 degrees Fahrenheit increase in average daily December temperatures since 1945.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \nApproximately 28 days (from December 3, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf current conditions persist without any significant anomalies, the average daily temperature for December 2024 in Barrow/Port Rogers, Alaska, is expected to remain consistent with historical averages. Given the region's extreme cold and stable climate patterns, exceeding the 1945-2023 average by ≥4 degrees F is highly unlikely.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 7 days remaining, the forecast would remain cautious. Short-term weather patterns, such as cold spells or temporary thaws, could slightly influence daily temperatures, but a sustained increase of ≥4 degrees F above the historical average would still be improbable.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nIf there were around 112 days remaining, extending well into the next year, the prediction would still consider the short-term influence on December temperatures minimal. Seasonal variations and long-term climate trends might offer more data points, but for December specifically, the likelihood of surpassing the historical average by ≥4 degrees F remains low.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nBarrow/Port Rogers NWS weather station in Alaska is situated in a region characterized by exceptionally cold temperatures, especially during December when polar night conditions prevail. Historical data from 1945-2023 indicate that average daily temperatures are significantly below freezing, and deviations of ≥4 degrees F above the mean are rare. Current forecasts for December 2024 do not suggest any anomalous warming trends that would contribute to such a substantial temperature increase. While the Arctic region is experiencing a general warming trend, the specific conditions in Barrow during December, including prolonged periods of darkness and typical weather patterns, counterbalance broader climatic shifts. Additionally, the absence of any forecasts indicating unusual warmth or significant reductions in sea ice further diminishes the probability of the average daily temperature exceeding the historical average by the specified margin.\n\n**Probability: 5%**",
