    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill election night 2024 end without Dave Wasserman, Nate Silver, or Nate Cohn calling the 2024 presidential election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-30\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **No** if  Dave Wasserman, Nate Silver, and/or Nate Cohn on their Twitter acounts (currently at @Redistrict, @NateSilver538, and @Nate_Cohn, respectively) call the winner of the presidential election before November 6, 2024 at 4:00 AM Eastern. If none has called a winner before that time and date, this question resolves as **Yes**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nFor purposes of this question, election night is considered to go through 4 AM on Wednesday November 6, 2024.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAll three elections analysts are known for calling elections before official media sources such as the AP. For previous AP calls please see: [Here’s when past presidential elections were called](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4954203-heres-when-past-presidential-elections-were-called/)\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine whether election night 2024 might end without Dave Wasserman, Nate Silver, or Nate Cohn calling the 2024 presidential election, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Election Night Projections\n- Election night projections often depend on the availability and accuracy of polling data, voter turnout, and the efficiency of vote counting processes. If the election is closely contested or if there are significant delays in vote counting, it could be challenging for analysts to make definitive calls.\n\n## Analysts' Roles and Methods\n- **Dave Wasserman**: As an analyst for The Cook Political Report, Wasserman is known for his detailed forecasts and updates on election outcomes. He typically waits for substantial data before making a call. If the election is too close or if data is slow to come in, he might not make a definitive call by the early morning hours after the election.\n- **Nate Silver**: Silver, the editor-in-chief of FiveThirtyEight, uses statistical models to predict election outcomes. His predictions are often based on a wide range of polling data and historical trends. If the data is inconclusive or if there are significant uncertainties, Silver might not make a definitive call immediately.\n- **Nate Cohn**: Cohn, The New York Times' chief political analyst, also relies on polling data and electoral trends. Like Silver, he would need robust and clear data to make a confident call. If the election results are too close or if there are discrepancies in the data, Cohn might also hesitate to make an immediate call.\n\n## Historical Context\n- In recent elections, there have been instances where analysts delayed their calls due to close margins or slow vote counting. For example, the 2020 presidential election saw delays in calling certain states due to the high volume of mail-in ballots and close margins.\n\n## Current Election Dynamics\n- The 2024 presidential election is expected to be highly competitive, with polls indicating a close race, especially in swing states. This competitiveness could lead to delays in vote counting and analysis, making it harder for analysts to make definitive calls on election night.\n\nGiven these points, it is plausible that election night 2024 could end without a definitive call from Dave Wasserman, Nate Silver, or Nate Cohn if the election is closely contested, if there are delays in vote counting, or if the data is not conclusive by the early morning hours after the election. However, this cannot be determined with certainty without knowing the specific circumstances of the election night.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Dave Wasserman publicly stated any intentions regarding early election night calls for the 2024 presidential election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Dave Wasserman has publicly stated any intentions regarding early election night calls for the 2024 presidential election. The sources discuss his analysis and insights on the election, but they do not mention his plans or intentions for making early calls on election night.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Dave Wasserman call the winner of the 2020 presidential election before 4 AM on election night?\nANSWER: No, Dave Wasserman did not call the winner of the 2020 presidential election before 4 AM on election night. The election results, particularly in key states like Pennsylvania, took several days to be fully counted and verified. It was not until November 7, after the mail-in ballots were counted, that major news outlets and election analysts like Wasserman could confidently declare Joe Biden the winner.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Nate Silver call the winner of the 2020 presidential election before 4 AM on election night?\nANSWER: Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight did not call the winner of the 2020 presidential election before 4 AM on election night. Instead, they provided probabilistic forecasts and analyzed the likelihood of different outcomes, but the actual call of the winner was made by news organizations after the counting of votes had progressed further.\n\nFor example, the ABC News article mentions that as of Thursday morning after the election, ABC News had yet to project a winner in several key states, and Nate Silver discussed the ongoing vote counting and the narrowing margins in states like Georgia and Pennsylvania.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **NO**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Nate Cohn call the winner of the 2020 presidential election before 4 AM on election night?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific information indicating that Nate Cohn called the winner of the 2020 presidential election before 4 AM on election night. The sources discuss the complexities and uncertainties of election night projections, including the fluctuations in the Upshot’s probability needle and the challenges in predicting the outcome due to various factors such as mail-in ballots and voting rules. However, they do not provide a clear answer to whether Nate Cohn made a definitive call before 4 AM.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Nate Silver expressed caution about making early projections during the 2024 election night?\nANSWER: Yes, Nate Silver has expressed caution about making early projections and relying on instincts or initial predictions during the 2024 election.\n\nIn his writings and interviews, Silver has emphasized the importance of accepting that the current forecasts indicate a very close race, often describing it as a 50-50 scenario. He has cautioned against placing significant weight on anyone's instincts, including his own, and has stressed the need to remain open to the possibility that predictions could be incorrect.\n\nSilver also highlighted the potential for polling errors and the uncertainty inherent in polling results, especially in a tightly contested election. He advised against making definitive projections based on current data, given the historical context of polling errors and the complexities of electoral dynamics.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have mail-in ballots or early voting numbers increased significantly for the 2024 election compared to 2020?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that early voting numbers for the 2024 election may not have increased significantly compared to 2020. Here are the key points:\n\n- Early voting in the 2020 election surged due to the pandemic, leading to a massive increase in overall turnout.\n- For the 2024 election, early voting may not reach the levels it did in 2020, partly because more people feel comfortable voting in person on Election Day and because some states have made early voting more difficult.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nNO\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do the 2024 election forecasts show a clear and decisive leader in electoral votes?\nANSWER: NO.\n\nThe forecasts and polling data for the 2024 presidential election do not indicate a clear and decisive leader in electoral votes. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- The national polls show a tight race with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump within a couple of percentage points of each other, and this closeness is also reflected in the battleground states.\n- In the seven key battleground states, the polls are very tight, with neither candidate having a decisive lead. The margins in states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are less than one point.\n- There is significant uncertainty due to the potential for polling errors, as seen in previous elections, and the unpredictable nature of undecided voters.\n- Various scenarios are possible, including a narrow victory for either candidate or a divided outcome where the electoral votes are closely split.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have polls indicated that the 2024 presidential election is expected to be a close race?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe sources consistently indicate that the 2024 presidential election is expected to be a close race. Here are some key points:\n\n- CBS News polls show the race as \"exactly even across the Battlegrounds\" with key states such as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin being within the margin of error.\n- The New York Times reports that polls in seven key battleground states are very close, and flipping just a state or two could lead to either candidate’s victory.\n- FiveThirtyEight's polling averages also suggest a tight race, with the national polling average showing a small lead for Kamala Harris but with a high degree of uncertainty in the battleground states.\n- The stability in poll averages over the last month, despite the close margins, further emphasizes the tight nature of the race.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any anticipated legal challenges or disputes that could delay the announcement of the 2024 election results?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several anticipated legal challenges and disputes that could potentially delay the announcement of the 2024 election results.\n\n- Numerous lawsuits have already been filed by both Republicans and Democrats, many of which involve challenges to mail-in balloting, ballots from overseas voters, and claims of voting by non-U.S. citizens. These cases could come back after the votes are tallied to challenge the results in court.\n\n- There are ongoing legal battles over the certification of election results, particularly in states like Georgia, where new election rules have been challenged and ruled against by the courts. These disputes could lead to delays or attempts to refuse certification of results.\n\n- The updated Electoral Count Reform Act allows for a faster review process for certification disputes, which could be utilized by losing candidates to challenge the results, potentially leading to delays.\n\n- Republicans have been advocating for increased local authority in finalizing election results, which has led to contentious legal battles that could continue after the election, contributing to chaos and delays.\n\n- Experts have noted that multiple efforts to refuse to certify results simultaneously, along with a flurry of lawsuits, could make it more challenging for election officials and potentially delay the announcement of the results.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are key swing states expected to experience delays in vote counting during the 2024 election?\nANSWER: YES\n\nSeveral key swing states are expected to experience delays in vote counting during the 2024 election due to various factors such as absentee ballot procedures, mail-in voting rules, and high turnout.\n\n- In Wisconsin, delays are expected due to the central counting of absentee ballots, which cannot begin until 7 a.m. on Election Day, and the need to count nearly all ballots in close races.\n- Pennsylvania is anticipated to have delayed results because mail-in ballots cannot be processed until 7 a.m. on Election Day, and it may take days to count them, especially in close races.\n- Nevada's acceptance of mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day up to four days afterward is expected to delay final results.\n- Arizona's high volume of early ballots dropped off on Election Day, which require verification, is also expected to delay final results.\n- Michigan, while having streamlined processes, still faces potential delays due to the high volume of early and absentee voting, although it is expected to have results earlier than many other swing states.\n\nThese factors indicate that delays in vote counting are anticipated in several key swing states.",
    "comment": "(a) The time left until the outcome of the question is known is approximately **7 days**.\n\n(b) If nothing changed, the outcome would be that **election night ends without Dave Wasserman, Nate Silver, or Nate Cohn calling the 2024 presidential election**, so the question would resolve as **Yes**.\n\n(c) If there was only a quarter of the time left (about **1.75 days**), I would forecast a slightly higher probability that the question resolves as **Yes**, due to the reduced likelihood of unexpected events.\n\n(d) If there was 4 times the time left (about **28 days**), I would slightly lower the probability, acknowledging the increased chance of significant developments that could lead to an early call.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThe 2024 presidential election is projected to be a highly competitive and closely contested race, with polls indicating a tight matchup between the candidates. Historical precedents and several key factors inform the probability estimate:\n\n1. **Historical Context:**\n   - In the **2020 presidential election**, none of the analysts—Dave Wasserman, Nate Silver, or Nate Cohn—called the winner before 4 AM on election night due to delays in vote counting and the closeness of the race.\n   - Previous elections with tight margins or extensive mail-in voting have resulted in delayed projections.\n\n2. **Anticipated Delays in Vote Counting:**\n   - **Key swing states** such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona are expected to experience delays in vote counting due to mail-in ballots, absentee voting procedures, and high voter turnout.\n   - **Mail-in ballots** and early voting numbers remain substantial, and some states cannot begin processing these ballots until Election Day, contributing to slower result tabulation.\n\n3. **Analysts' Caution and Methodology:**\n   - **Dave Wasserman**, **Nate Silver**, and **Nate Cohn** are known for their analytical rigor and caution, often waiting for substantial and reliable data before making projections.\n   - **Nate Silver** has expressed caution about making early projections, emphasizing the uncertainty inherent in closely contested elections.\n\n4. **Potential Legal Challenges and Disputes:**\n   - Anticipated **legal challenges** and disputes over election results could further delay the ability of analysts to confidently call the election.\n   - Ongoing lawsuits and the potential for certification disputes may create additional uncertainty on election night.\n\n5. **No Clear Decisive Leader:**\n   - Current forecasts do not show a clear and decisive leader in electoral votes, increasing the likelihood that the outcome will not be immediately apparent on election night.\n\nGiven these factors, it is highly probable that election night will end without any of the three analysts calling the presidential election before 4 AM on November 6, 2024.\n\n**Probability: 80%**",
