    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nBefore January 1, 2025, will Tech Crunch report new layoffs at TikTok or ByteDance?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-12-10\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to Tech Crunch's tracker \"A comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs,\" which can be accessed [here](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/13/tech-layoffs-2024-list/), TikTok or ByteDance have layoffs following the launch of this question and before January 1, 2025, To resolve the question, a Metaculus Admin will go to the Tech Crunch link on or after January 1, 2025 and see if TikTok or ByteDance appears for the time in question. If TikTok or ByteDance are not listed as having a layoff event during that period, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nTech Crunch's \"comprehensive list of 2024 tech layoffs\" will be the sole source used for resolution of this question, regardless of information from other sources. If a layoff event appears in the time period listed, this question resolves as Yes, and if not, it resolves as No. \n\nAccording to Tech Crunch, \"Below youâ€™ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2024, to be updated regularly.\" Admins to resolve this question will only be looking to see what is on the page at the time of resolution. If Tech Crunch ceases to publish updates on the resolution source following the launch of this question (regardless of what can be found elsewhere on the Tech Crunch website), this question resolves as **No**. \n\nFor ease of resolution, in this series of questions, in order to count the Tech Crunch page must specifically list the company in question, which in this case is TikTok or ByteDance. This is true regardless of subsidiaries or ownerships. So for example, a question on Microsoft must specifically mention Microsoft, and a layoff event at LinkedIn will not count for purposes of this question (unless the subheading mentions Microsoft), even though LinkedIn is owned by Microsoft.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTikTok had a layoff event listed in January, April and May. ByteDance had an event in June.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of TechCrunch reporting new layoffs at TikTok or ByteDance before January 1, 2025, here are some relevant points:\n\n## Recent Layoff Trends\n- ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has recently undertaken significant layoffs. In November 2023, it announced the restructuring of its gaming division, Nuverse, which involved mass layoffs[1][2].\n- Additionally, in 2024, TikTok laid off hundreds of employees, primarily in Malaysia, as part of a shift towards AI-driven content moderation. There were also layoffs in other departments such as operations, marketing, sales, and advertising earlier in 2024[4].\n\n## Economic and Industry Context\n- The tech industry has been experiencing a wave of layoffs across various companies due to economic challenges, regulatory pressures, and strategic shifts. This trend is not unique to ByteDance but is part of a broader industry pattern[3][5].\n\n## Company Strategy and Adjustments\n- ByteDance has been reviewing its businesses and making adjustments to focus on long-term strategic growth areas. This includes divesting or restructuring less successful ventures, such as its gaming division and virtual reality endeavors[1].\n\nGiven these points, it is plausible that TechCrunch could report new layoffs at TikTok or ByteDance before January 1, 2025, especially if the company continues to adjust its operations in response to economic conditions and strategic priorities. However, without specific information about upcoming plans, it is not possible to definitively answer the question as a yes or no.\n\n### Reference Classes and Base Rates\n- The base rate of layoffs in the tech industry, particularly among large companies like ByteDance, is relatively high in the current economic climate.\n- The recent history of layoffs within ByteDance itself suggests a pattern of periodic workforce adjustments.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The timing of such reports would depend on when ByteDance makes any new decisions regarding layoffs and when TechCrunch becomes aware of these decisions.\n\nWhile the information provided does not guarantee new layoffs will be reported, it does indicate a context where such events are more likely. Therefore, a superforecaster should consider the recent trends and the broader industry context when making a prediction.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has ByteDance's revenue decreased in the second half of 2024?\nANSWER: The available sources do not provide specific data on ByteDance's revenue for the second half of 2024. They discuss the company's revenue and growth rates for the first half of 2024, but there is no information given about the second half of the year.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is TikTok investing more in AI-driven content moderation in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nTikTok is indeed investing more in AI-driven content moderation in 2024. The company has announced plans to shift towards AI-powered moderation, which includes investing $2 billion in trust and safety efforts this year, with a focus on enhancing efficiency through automated technologies[2][3][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has ByteDance announced any layoffs after June 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, ByteDance has announced layoffs after June 2024.\n\n- In October 2024, ByteDance announced the layoff of about 500 employees, as reported by Reuters[5].\n- Additionally, there were earlier reports of layoffs in the Indonesian e-commerce unit, but these were initiated in June 2024. However, the October announcement is clearly after June 2024[5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has TikTok announced any workforce reductions in departments other than AI moderation in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, TikTok has announced workforce reductions in departments other than AI moderation in 2024.\n\n- Layoffs began in March 2024, targeting TikTok's African team, which included reductions in marketing and operations teams[1].\n- In May 2024, TikTok announced global layoffs, focusing on its operations and marketing teams[1][4].\n- Additionally, in April 2024, the company cut over 250 jobs in Ireland, and in January 2024, it laid off 60 employees in sales and advertising[5].\n\nThese reductions were not limited to AI moderation but affected various other departments.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is TechCrunch actively updating its \"2024 tech layoffs\" list on a monthly basis?\nANSWER: Yes, TechCrunch is actively updating its \"2024 tech layoffs\" list on a monthly basis. The sources indicate that the list is updated regularly to include new layoff information as it becomes available.\n\n- The TechCrunch article mentions that the list will be \"updated regularly\" and provides breakdowns of layoffs by month throughout 2024[1][2].\n- The updates include specific details on layoffs for each month, such as the number of employees laid off and the companies involved[1][2].\n\nThis suggests that TechCrunch is continually monitoring and updating the list to reflect the latest information on tech layoffs.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the tech industry experiencing ongoing layoffs in late 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThe sources provided indicate that the tech industry is indeed experiencing ongoing layoffs in late 2024. Here are some key points:\n\n- In October 2024, companies like Dropbox, Meta, and Tidal announced significant job cuts[2][4].\n- In November 2024, companies such as 23andMe, AMD, and others also announced layoffs[4].\n- Updates as recent as December 5, 2024, include layoff announcements from companies like Lightspeed Commerce, AlphaSense, and Ola Electric[5].\n- These layoffs are part of a broader trend of job cuts in the tech sector that has continued from 2023 into 2024[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has TikTok expanded its operations in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nTikTok has indeed expanded its operations in 2024. Here are some key points from the sources:\n\n- TikTok aims to expand its U.S. e-commerce business tenfold by 2024, targeting $17.5 billion in revenue[1][3].\n- TikTok Shop has seen significant growth, with brands experiencing substantial sales increases after joining the platform[3].\n- There has been an expansion of TikTok Shop into various regions, including the progressive opening of cross-border e-commerce in Southeast Asia and the opening of local shops in the United States[3].\n- Plans are in place to launch small shops in additional countries such as Brazil, Spain, France, Italy, Australia, and New Zealand after the start of 2024[3].\n\nThese points indicate active expansion and growth of TikTok's operations in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there new regulatory pressures on ByteDance in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nIn 2024, there are significant new regulatory pressures on ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Here are some key points:\n\n- The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill that requires ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations or face a nationwide ban, citing national security concerns and the potential for data sharing with the Chinese government[1][3][5].\n- A recent court ruling has upheld this law, mandating that ByteDance sell TikTok to a U.S. entity by January 19, 2025, or face a ban from U.S. app stores[2][4].\n- The Chinese government has also signaled its intention to intervene in any potential sale of TikTok, potentially blocking the transaction under export control regulations and national security concerns[1].\n\nThese developments indicate heightened regulatory scrutiny and pressure on ByteDance in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has TechCrunch reported layoffs at other major tech companies in 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, TechCrunch has reported layoffs at several major tech companies in 2024.\n\n- Companies like Tesla, Amazon, Google, TikTok, Snap, and Microsoft have conducted sizable layoffs in the first months of 2024[2].\n- Specific examples include:\n  - Amazon laying off around 9,000 staff in March 2024[3].\n  - Meta laying off around 10,000 staff in March 2024[3].\n  - Dropbox cutting 20% of its workforce, impacting 528 employees, in October 2024[2].\n  - TikTok laying off hundreds of employees, mainly in Malaysia, as it turns to AI for content moderation[2].\n  - Intel laying off 15,000 employees, accounting for 15% of its total staff, in October 2024[2].\n  - Other companies such as iRobot, AMD, and Coursera have also been reported to have made significant layoffs in November 2024[1][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is ByteDance currently undergoing financial restructuring?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that ByteDance is undergoing significant restructuring, although the term \"financial restructuring\" might be slightly nuanced.\n\n- ByteDance is restructuring its gaming business, involving the cancellation of in-development projects, divestment from its gaming segment, and layoffs of around 1,000 employees[1].\n- The company is also cutting jobs globally, including content moderation teams, as part of a broader cost-cutting strategy and to refine its operational costs[4].\n- These actions are part of ByteDance's efforts to focus on long-term strategic growth areas, such as its TikTok and Douyin businesses, and to adapt to economic challenges and regulatory pressures[1][4].\n\nWhile these actions involve significant organizational and operational changes, they can be seen as part of a broader restructuring effort rather than a traditional financial restructuring like debt restructuring or bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\n21 days (from December 10, 2024, to January 1, 2025)\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nNo. If current conditions remain unchanged, there would be no new layoffs reported at TikTok or ByteDance by TechCrunch before January 1, 2025.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith approximately 5 days remaining, the probability of new layoffs being reported would be low. **Probability: 15%**\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nWith around 84 days until resolution, the probability increases significantly due to ongoing economic pressures and recent layoff trends. **Probability: 70%**\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the current date of December 10, 2024, there are 21 days remaining until the question resolves on January 1, 2025. Over the past year, both TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have engaged in multiple layoffs, indicating a pattern of periodic workforce adjustments in response to economic challenges and strategic shifts. The tech industry as a whole continues to experience a high frequency of layoffs, further increasing the likelihood of additional workforce reductions.\n\nTechCrunch has been consistently updating its \"2024 tech layoffs\" list on a monthly basis, demonstrating active monitoring and reporting of such events. The recent layoffs in October 2024 suggest that ByteDance is still undergoing significant restructuring efforts, which may lead to further layoffs as the company continues to adapt to regulatory pressures and economic conditions.\n\nHowever, the remaining time of 21 days is relatively short, which somewhat limits the window for new announcements. If only a quarter of the time (approximately 5 days) were left, the probability of new layoffs being reported would be quite low, as companies typically require more time to announce and implement such changes. Conversely, if there were 84 days left, the probability would be higher due to the extended period during which additional layoffs could be planned and executed.\n\nBalancing these factors, with 21 days remaining, there is a moderate likelihood of new layoffs being reported, influenced by recent trends and ongoing economic pressures.\n\n**Probability: 55%**",
