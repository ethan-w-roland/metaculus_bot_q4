{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill US airline passenger volume for the Veterans Day weekend of 2024 be up year over year, according to the TSA?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-21\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if total passenger volume for the Veterans Day travel weekend of 2024, which we define as the sum of the passenger figures for the five day period of Friday November 8, 2024, through Tuesday November 12, 2024 exceed the equivalent Veterans Day travel weekend of 2023, which we define as the five day period of Friday, November 10, 2023 through Tuesday November 14, 2023. The resolution source is the TSA checkpoint travel numbers, which can be found at [this link](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes) for 2024. The archived 2023 TSA passenger volume numbers can be found [here](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes/2023).\n\nThe five days of November 10, 2023 through November 14, 2023, had respective passenger numbers of 2,591,818, 2,025,517, 2,683,745, 2,533,300, and 2,035,761, for a total of 11,870,141. Therefore, this question resolves as **Yes** if passenger volume for the five-day Veterans Day travel period for 2024 exceeds 11,870,141 and resolves as **No** if it is less than or equal to 11,870,141.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe question will resolve as soon as the data is posted and accessed by Metaculus Admins. However, if there are delays then resolution will wait up to the end of the quarter to be posted for the time in question. If it has not been posted as of January 7, 2025, when accessed by Admins, this question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nVeterans Day in the US is [federal holiday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States) and is a celebrated on November 11th, regardless of the day of the week upon which it falls. In 2023 it fell on a Saturday, and in 2024 it will fall on a Monday.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess whether US airline passenger volume for the Veterans Day weekend of 2024 will be up year over year according to the TSA, here are some relevant points to consider:\n\n## Current Trends\n- The TSA has been reporting record-breaking passenger volumes in 2024, particularly around holidays such as Memorial Day and the Independence Day weekend. For example, on July 7, 2024, the TSA screened over 3 million passengers in a single day, a new record.\n\n## Historical Context\n- Passenger volumes have been increasing steadily since mid-2023, with several days surpassing 2.5 million passengers, a threshold that was rarely crossed in previous years. This trend suggests a strong recovery in air travel demand.\n\n## Economic and Travel Demand Factors\n- Low unemployment rates and a strong economy are driving consumer spending, which in turn is fueling high air travel demand. Experts predict this trend to continue through the rest of 2024.\n\n## Holiday Travel Patterns\n- Holidays like Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Thanksgiving typically see the highest volumes of air passengers. While Veterans Day may not be as peak as these holidays, it still represents a significant travel period. Given the overall increase in travel demand, it is plausible that Veterans Day weekend could see higher passenger volumes compared to the previous year.\n\n## TSA Preparedness and Efficiency\n- The TSA has improved its efficiency and recruitment, which has helped in managing the increased passenger volumes without significant delays. This suggests that the TSA is better equipped to handle higher passenger numbers.\n\nGiven these points, while the specific data for Veterans Day weekend 2024 is not yet available, the general trend and factors suggest that passenger volumes are likely to be up year over year. However, the exact numbers would need to be confirmed by the TSA's future reports.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Will Veterans Day 2024 fall on a Monday?\nANSWER: Yes, Veterans Day 2024 will fall on a Monday. Although the actual date of Veterans Day is November 11, which in 2024 falls on a Saturday, the federal observation date for 2024 is designated as Monday, November 11, to allow for a weekday observance.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the TSA report record-breaking passenger volumes in 2024 for other holidays?\nANSWER: The sources provided focus primarily on the record-breaking passenger volumes around the Independence Day (Fourth of July) holiday in 2024. There is no mention of record-breaking passenger volumes for other holidays in the sources.\n\n- The records mentioned were set on June 23 and July 7, both of which are associated with the Independence Day holiday travel period.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided sources, it is unclear if the TSA reported record-breaking passenger volumes for other holidays in 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the number of airlines operating during Veterans Day weekend increase in 2024 compared to 2023?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not contain information about the number of airlines operating during Veterans Day weekend in 2023 or 2024. They discuss various ways airlines honor veterans, discounts and benefits offered to military personnel, and general travel trends, but they do not provide specific data on the number of airlines operating during these periods.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current unemployment rate in the US low as of 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, the current unemployment rate in the US is relatively low as of 2024.\n\n- The national unemployment rate in the second quarter of 2024 was 4.0%, which is historically low compared to the long-term average of 5.69%.\n- As of September 2024, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 4.10%, still lower than the long-term average.\n- This rate is described as part of one of the strongest labor markets in recent memory.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the US economy considered strong in 2024?\nANSWER: YES\n\nMultiple sources indicate that the US economy is considered strong in 2024. Here are some key points:\n\n- The U.S. economy has shown solid economic growth, low unemployment, and a trend towards achieving the 2% inflation target, despite some delays in moderation.\n- The IMF described the U.S. economy as \"remarkably strong\" with activity and employment exceeding expectations and a disinflation process that has been less costly than feared.\n- The GDP growth for the second quarter of 2024 was revised upward to 3%, indicating robust growth fueled by strong consumer spending and business investment.\n- Despite challenges, the economy has demonstrated resilience, with consumer spending and business investment continuing to drive growth.\n\nThese points collectively support the conclusion that the US economy is strong in 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did similar holidays in 2024 experience higher passenger volumes compared to previous years?\nANSWER: Yes, similar holidays in 2024 experienced higher passenger volumes compared to previous years.\n\n- The Labor Day weekend in 2024 is expected to be the busiest ever, with 17 million passengers planned to fly, which is a record for the holiday.\n- The summer travel season, including Memorial Day and Independence Day, saw record-breaking passenger volumes. For example, June 2024 was the busiest month ever at U.S. airports, with an average of 2.73 million passengers per day passing through TSA checkpoints.\n- The TSA forecasted that the Memorial Day weekend would see a 6.4% increase in passenger volumes compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nThese indicators show that passenger volumes during these holidays in 2024 were higher than in previous years.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have passenger volumes been increasing steadily since mid-2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is clear that passenger volumes have been increasing, but the specific trend since mid-2023 can be inferred from the following points:\n\n- Global passenger numbers in 2023 were close to pre-pandemic levels, with some regions already surpassing 2019 levels. For example, the US domestic market was ahead of 2019 levels for every month in 2023.\n- By the end of 2023, passenger numbers had nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels, with some regions and markets already exceeding those levels.\n- The trend indicates a steady recovery throughout 2023, and projections suggest continued growth into 2024. For instance, the IATA report mentions that global demand for air travel remained strong in 2023 and is expected to continue growing.\n\nGiven this information, it can be concluded that passenger volumes have indeed been increasing steadily since mid-2023 as part of the broader recovery trend.\n\nYES\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have consumer spending levels increased in 2024 compared to 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the answer to whether consumer spending levels have increased in 2024 compared to 2023 is generally affirmative, though with some nuances.\n\n- Deloitte forecasts that real consumer spending will increase by 2.4% in 2024, which is slightly more than the 2.2% increase recorded in 2023.\n- Goldman Sachs notes that while the pace of consumer spending growth has slowed from above 3% in the second half of 2023 to around 2% in 2024, this is still considered a normalization rather than a weakening. They forecast real disposable income growth of 2.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, indicating continued growth.\n- Brown Advisory also acknowledges that consumer spending has been strong, although they expect softer consumer spending and disposable income growth in 2024, particularly affecting lower-income households. However, they still recognize that overall consumer spending remains a significant driver of the economy.\n\nTherefore, the overall indication is that consumer spending levels have increased in 2024 compared to 2023, albeit with some variations and potential softening in certain segments.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the TSA improved its efficiency and recruitment in 2024 compared to 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the information about improvements in efficiency and recruitment is largely focused on the changes and outcomes observed in 2023, but there are some indications of continued improvements extending into 2024.\n\n### Efficiency\n- The sources do not provide specific details on new efficiency improvements in 2024, but they do mention that the technologies and processes implemented in 2023, such as the deployment of new screening technologies and cybersecurity measures, are ongoing.\n\n### Recruitment and Retention\n- The pay increase implemented in 2023, which was continued through 2024, has led to a significant reduction in staff attrition rates and an increase in recruitment. As of 2024, TSA has reported more interest in job openings and a 9% drop in staff attrition rates compared to before the pay increase.\n\nGiven this information, while the sources do not provide detailed new initiatives specifically for 2024, they indicate that the positive trends in recruitment and retention observed in 2023 have continued into 2024.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe TSA has maintained and built upon the improvements in recruitment and retention from 2023 into 2024, although specific new efficiency improvements for 2024 are not detailed in the sources.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any major events or disruptions expected during the Veterans Day weekend of 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several major events and activities planned for the Veterans Day weekend of 2024, which could result in some disruptions, particularly in areas where these events are held.\n\n## Arlington National Cemetery\n- The Veterans Day National Ceremony will be held on November 11, 2024, at Arlington National Cemetery, starting at 11:00 a.m. with a wreath laying at the Tomb of the Unknowns and continuing with a parade of colors and remarks from dignitaries.\n\n## New York City\n- The New York City Veterans Day Parade, the nation's largest Veterans Day event, will take place on November 11, 2024, with an estimated 20,000 participants marching up Fifth Avenue. This event is likely to cause significant traffic and crowd disruptions in Manhattan.\n\n## Other Locations\n- Various parades and ceremonies are scheduled across the country, including in cities like Denver, Colorado; Hot Springs, Arkansas; Orlando and Tampa, Florida; and Loveland, Colorado. These events may cause local traffic and crowd disruptions.\n\n## Special Events\n- Additional events such as the Stand Up for Heroes at the Lincoln Center in New York City, the Veterans Day Concert in Parker, Colorado, and special programming at various museums and memorials in Washington, D.C., will also attract large crowds and may cause some disruptions.\n\nThese events are part of the widespread observances to honor veterans and are likely to draw significant attention and participation, leading to potential disruptions in the areas where they are held.", "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n25 days (from October 21, 2024, to approximately November 15, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \n**No.** If passenger volumes remained unchanged from 2023, the total would be 11,870,141, which does not exceed the 2024 threshold.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \n**65%** probability that passenger volumes are up year over year.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \n**80%** probability that passenger volumes are up year over year.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Current Trends and Historical Context:**  \n   - **Record-Breaking Volumes:** The TSA has reported record-breaking passenger volumes in 2024, especially around major holidays like Memorial Day and Independence Day. For instance, on July 7, 2024, over 3 million passengers were screened, setting a new record.\n   - **Steady Recovery:** Passenger volumes have been increasing steadily since mid-2023, with several days surpassing 2.5 million passengers\u2014 a significant rise from previous years. This indicates a robust recovery in air travel demand.\n\n2. **Economic Factors:**  \n   - **Strong Economy:** The US economy remains strong in 2024, characterized by low unemployment rates (4.0% in Q2 2024) and high consumer spending. A strong economy typically correlates with increased discretionary spending, including travel.\n   - **Consumer Spending:** Real consumer spending is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2024 compared to 2.2% in 2023, sustaining the upward trend in travel demand.\n\n3. **Holiday Travel Patterns:**  \n   - **Comparison with Similar Holidays:** Other major holidays in 2024, such as Labor Day and Memorial Day, experienced higher passenger volumes compared to previous years. This trend suggests that Veterans Day weekend is likely to follow suit.\n   - **Veterans Day Specifics:** While Veterans Day may not reach the peak levels of some other holidays, the overall upward trend in travel demand supports the likelihood of increased passenger volumes.\n\n4. **TSA Preparedness:**  \n   - **Improved Efficiency and Recruitment:** The TSA has enhanced its efficiency and recruitment efforts, resulting in better management of increased passenger numbers without significant delays. This improvement mitigates potential bottlenecks that could deter travelers.\n\n5. **Potential Disruptions:**  \n   - **Events and Celebrations:** While major events during Veterans Day weekend (e.g., parades in New York City and Arlington National Cemetery) may cause local disruptions, the overall impact on national passenger volumes is expected to be minimal given the strong demand.\n\n6. **Time-Based Forecast Adjustments:**  \n   - **With Only a Quarter of Time Left (Approximately 6 Days):** Based on the strong current trends and economic indicators, there's a 65% probability that passenger volumes have increased year over year.\n   - **With 4x the Time Left (Approximately 12 Weeks):** Extended time would likely provide additional data reinforcing the upward trend, increasing the probability to 80%.\n\nConsidering the steady increase in passenger volumes since mid-2023, strong economic indicators, successful management by the TSA, and higher passenger numbers during comparable holidays in 2024, it is reasonable to forecast a higher likelihood that Veterans Day weekend 2024 passenger volumes will exceed those of 2023.\n\n**Probability: 75%**", "probability": 75}
