    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Missouri voters approve Missouri Amendment 7, which would prohibit ranked-choice voting in the state?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-31\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if [Missouri Amendment 7](https://www.sos.mo.gov/elections/petitions/2024BallotMeasures) is approved in the 2024 general election, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that this question is looking only at whether the state's voters approve the ballot measure. Therefore such factors as its effectiveness date, funding, repeal, litigation, enforcement, or other such issues will not be considered when resolving this question.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Missouri Amendment 7, Require Citizenship to Vote and Prohibit Ranked-Choice Voting Amendment (2024)](https://ballotpedia.org/Missouri_Amendment_7,_Require_Citizenship_to_Vote_and_Prohibit_Ranked-Choice_Voting_Amendment_(2024))\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo predict whether Missouri voters will approve Missouri Amendment 7, which aims to prohibit ranked-choice voting in the state, here are some key points and context that could influence the decision:\n\n## Ballot Measure Details\n- Missouri Amendment 7 seeks to amend the Missouri Constitution to prohibit ranked-choice voting, limit voters to a single vote per candidate or issue, and ensure that only the plurality winner of a political party primary advances to the general election.\n- The amendment also includes language to clarify that only U.S. citizens can vote, although this is already prohibited by state law.\n\n## Current Use of Ranked-Choice Voting\n- Currently, ranked-choice voting or approval voting is not widely used in Missouri, except in the city of St. Louis, which adopted approval voting for citywide primary races in 2020 and is exempt from this amendment.\n\n## Arguments For and Against\n- Supporters of ranked-choice voting argue that it makes politics less polarized, forces candidates to represent a broader range of voter views, and reduces the strategy of voting for the \"lesser of two evils\".\n- Opponents argue that the amendment is necessary to prevent potential issues with noncitizen voting (despite this already being illegal) and to maintain traditional voting methods. They also question the clarity and effectiveness of ranked-choice voting.\n\n## Public Opinion and Campaigning\n- There is significant campaigning on both sides, with groups like Better Ballot KC and Show Me Integrity opposing the amendment, while others like Americans for Citizen Voting support it. The opposition argues that the amendment is misleading and aims to trick voters by emphasizing the noncitizen voting aspect, which is already illegal.\n\n## Electoral Context\n- Missouri tends to lean Republican in statewide elections, while cities like Kansas City and St. Louis tend to lean Democratic. This could influence how different regions of the state vote on the amendment.\n\nGiven these points, it is not immediately clear whether Missouri voters will approve or reject Amendment 7. The outcome will depend on various factors, including voter awareness of the issues, the effectiveness of the campaigns on both sides, and the general political leanings of the state.\n\n### Base Rates and Reference Classes\n- Ranked-choice voting is not widely adopted in the U.S., but it is gaining traction in some states and cities. This could influence voter perceptions of its viability and benefits.\n- Previous ballot measures related to electoral system changes have had varied outcomes across different states, which might provide some context but do not directly predict the outcome in Missouri.\n\n### Time to Resolution\n- The election is scheduled for November 5, 2024, so the resolution of this question will be determined within the next few weeks.\n\nWithout specific polling data or more detailed public opinion surveys, it is challenging to make a definitive prediction on whether Missouri voters will approve Amendment 7. The decision will likely be influenced by a combination of the arguments presented, voter education, and the broader political climate in Missouri.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is ranked-choice voting currently used extensively in Missouri?\nANSWER: NO\n\nRanked-choice voting is not currently used extensively in Missouri. While the city of St. Louis has implemented approval voting (a related but distinct system) for citywide primary races, there is no widespread use of ranked-choice voting at the state or federal levels in Missouri.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are influential political groups in Missouri campaigning in favor of Missouri Amendment 7?\nANSWER: Yes, influential political groups in Missouri are campaigning in favor of Missouri Amendment 7.\n\nGroups such as Freedom Principle MO, led by its president Byron Keelin, and the Liberty Alliance, a Kansas City-based conservative group, are actively campaigning to vote yes on Missouri Amendment 7.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do Missouri voters tend to follow the recommendations of their political leaders on ballot measures?\nANSWER: The available sources do not provide direct evidence to determine whether Missouri voters tend to follow the recommendations of their political leaders on ballot measures.\n\n- The sources detail various ballot measures, their outcomes, and the financial backing behind them, but they do not analyze the influence of political leaders' recommendations on voter decisions.\n- There is no specific data or study mentioned in the sources that correlates voter choices with the recommendations of political leaders.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether Missouri voters tend to follow the recommendations of their political leaders on ballot measures is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have previous measures against ranked-choice voting been proposed and failed in Missouri?\nANSWER: Yes, previous measures against or related to ranked-choice voting have been proposed and failed in Missouri.\n\nIn 2022, a bipartisan group attempted to introduce ranked-choice voting in Missouri through an initiative petition. This proposal aimed to change the voting process for general elections for state offices, allowing voters to rank candidates in the general election. However, this initiative failed to gather enough signatures to go to the voters.\n\nTherefore, there has been a previous attempt to implement ranked-choice voting that did not succeed.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are prominent Missouri politicians publicly supporting Missouri Amendment 7?\nANSWER: Yes, prominent Missouri politicians are publicly supporting Missouri Amendment 7.\n\n- State Rep. Adam Schwadron (R-106) and Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe, who is also the Republican nominee for governor, have expressed support for the amendment. Kehoe endorsed the measure, emphasizing the need to secure elections in Missouri and respect the rights of naturalized citizens.\n- The Republican nominee for Secretary of State, State Sen. Denny Hoskins, also supports the amendment, citing concerns about voter eligibility in other states.\n\nThese endorsements indicate that there is significant support for the amendment among some of Missouri's prominent politicians.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have similar amendments prohibiting ranked-choice voting been approved in other conservative states?\nANSWER: Yes, similar amendments or laws prohibiting ranked-choice voting (RCV) have been approved in several conservative states.\n\nAs of April 2024, states such as Montana, Idaho, South Dakota, Tennessee, Florida, Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Oklahoma have banned RCV through various legislative or ballot measures.\n\nThese bans indicate a trend in some conservative states to reject the implementation of ranked-choice voting in their electoral systems.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have Missouri voters historically approved ballot measures that restrict voting methods?\nANSWER: The available sources do not provide a comprehensive history of Missouri voters' decisions on ballot measures specifically related to restricting voting methods. However, they do discuss current and recent proposals:\n\n- Missouri Amendment 7, which is on the ballot for November 2024, aims to restrict ranked-choice voting and ensure only U.S. citizens can vote. However, this has not yet been voted on.\n- There is no historical data provided in the sources regarding past ballot measures that specifically restricted voting methods.\n\nGiven the lack of historical data in the sources, the answer to whether Missouri voters have historically approved such measures is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Missouri generally a Republican-leaning state?\nANSWER: Yes, Missouri is generally considered a Republican-leaning state.\n\n- Since 2000, Missouri has voted Republican in every presidential election, with Donald Trump winning the state by over 15% in 2020.\n- The state has consistently voted for Republican presidential candidates in recent decades, marking a shift from its historical role as a bellwether state that often voted for the winning presidential candidate.\n- The suburbs and rural areas of Missouri are particularly conservative, contributing to the state's overall Republican lean.\n- Missouri's voting trends and electoral history indicate a strong Republican bias in recent years.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant opposition among Missouri voters to ranked-choice voting?\nANSWER: The information available does not provide a clear picture of the level of opposition among Missouri voters specifically, but it does indicate various perspectives and actions related to ranked-choice voting in Missouri.\n\n- There was a petition drive in 2022 to implement ranked-choice voting in Missouri, but it did not make the ballot. This suggests some level of support, but also indicates that it did not garner enough support to be put to a vote.\n- An attempt in the Missouri General Assembly to block the use of ranked-choice voting passed the House but died in the Senate, showing opposition from some lawmakers.\n- The current Missouri Amendment 7, which includes the elimination of ranked-choice voting, is a subject of debate. While this amendment has both supporters and opponents, the sources do not provide specific polling data or widespread voter sentiment on ranked-choice voting itself.\n\nGiven the lack of direct evidence on voter sentiment, the answer to whether there is significant opposition among Missouri voters to ranked-choice voting is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant public confusion or misunderstanding about what ranked-choice voting entails among Missouri voters?\nANSWER: YES\n\nThere is significant public confusion or misunderstanding about what ranked-choice voting entails among Missouri voters, as indicated by several sources:\n\n- Amendment 7 combines multiple issues, including the elimination of ranked-choice voting and ensuring only U.S. citizens can vote, which can make it harder for voters to understand the implications of their choices[4|.\n- Critics argue that the amendment's language could obscure the conversation about what voters really want in terms of representation and electoral fairness, suggesting confusion about the voting process[4|.\n- Proponents and opponents of ranked-choice voting highlight different aspects of the system, with some arguing it is confusing and cumbersome, while others explain it as a simple process. This divergence in explanations indicates a lack of clear understanding among voters.\n\nThese points suggest that there is indeed significant public confusion or misunderstanding about ranked-choice voting among Missouri voters.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:** Approximately 5 days (election on November 5, 2024).\n\n(b) **If nothing changed, the outcome would be:** Missouri voters approve Missouri Amendment 7.\n\n(c) **If there was only a quarter of the time left:** I would forecast a slightly higher probability of approval due to decreased time for opposition campaigns to influence voters.\n\n(d) **If there was 4x the time left:** I would maintain a similar forecast but with slightly increased uncertainty due to more time for campaigning and potential shifts in public opinion.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nMissouri is a Republican-leaning state, having consistently voted for Republican presidential candidates since 2000. Conservative values tend to influence statewide decisions, and similar measures prohibiting ranked-choice voting have been approved in other conservative states such as Montana, Idaho, Tennessee, and Florida.\n\nProminent Missouri politicians, including Lt. Gov. Mike Kehoe and State Sen. Denny Hoskins, are publicly supporting Amendment 7. Their endorsements could sway voters who align with their views. Additionally, influential political groups like Freedom Principle MO and the Liberty Alliance are campaigning in favor of the amendment.\n\nThe amendment includes language ensuring only U.S. citizens can vote, which, while already established by law, may resonate with voters concerned about election integrity. This aspect could increase support for the amendment, even if voters are not fully aware of the current legality.\n\nThere is significant confusion among voters about ranked-choice voting (RCV). Lack of widespread understanding may lead voters to prefer the status quo over a system they perceive as complex or unfamiliar. The combination of limited use of RCV in Missouri and the potential for misunderstandings may contribute to voters approving the prohibition.\n\nOpposition groups exist but may not have the same influence as the proponents. Without clear polling data indicating strong opposition, and considering the tendencies of Missouri voters to align with conservative measures, it is reasonable to predict that Amendment 7 will pass.\n\n**Probability: 80%**",
