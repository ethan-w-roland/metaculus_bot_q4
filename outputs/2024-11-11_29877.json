    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the new Prime Minister of Iceland belong to the Progressive Party after the 2024 parliamentary elections?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-11\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question will resolve **Yes** if the new prime minister belongs to the Progressive Party at the time of receiving the mandate to form a government by the President.\n\nIf, for any reason, no one has received the mandate before 1 January 2025 (including that the election is postponed or the coalition talks are ongoing), this question will resolve as **No**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe [2017 parliamentary elections in Iceland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Icelandic_parliamentary_election) resulted in an unusual governing coalition of the left-wing [Left-Green Movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-Green_Movement), the centre [Progressive Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_(Iceland)), and the centre-right [Independence Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Party_(Iceland)). Despite the Independence Party being the largest party in the coalition, the new prime minister was [Katrín Jakobsdóttir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katr%C3%ADn_Jakobsd%C3%B3ttir), the chairperson of the Left-Green Movement.\n\nIn [2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Icelandic_parliamentary_election), the three-party coalition maintained its majority and remained governmend under the lead of Katrín Jakobsdóttir. However, Jakobsdóttir resigned in April 2024 to contest the [presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Icelandic_presidential_election), which she lost. She was succeeded as prime minister by [Bjarni Benediktsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarni_Benediktsson_(born_1970)), the leader of the Independence Party, who had previously been the prime minister in 2017 and who was the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs of the current government.\n\nOn 13 October, Benediktsson [announced](https://apnews.com/article/iceland-snap-election-coalition-government-9d170f37de3228506de93444668c416a) that the government had collapsed due to disputes over foreign policy, asylum seekers, and energy, prompting him to call for new elections and ask President Halla Tómasdóttir the next day to dissolve the Althingi and set the elections for 30 November.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of the new Prime Minister of Iceland belonging to the Progressive Party after the 2024 parliamentary elections, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Political Landscape\n- The current Prime Minister, Bjarni Benediktsson, is from the Independence Party and has dissolved the ruling three-party coalition due to internal disagreements. This coalition included the Independence Party, the Progressive Party, and the Greens[3].\n\n## Reasons for Coalition Dissolution\n- The dissolution was prompted by disagreements on policy issues such as asylum seekers and energy efficiency. This indicates significant internal conflicts within the coalition[3].\n\n## Upcoming Elections\n- Fresh parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place on 30 November 2024, following the dissolution of the current parliament. The outcome of these elections will determine the composition of the new government[3].\n\n## Historical Context and Base Rates\n- The Progressive Party has been part of the coalition government since November 2021 but has not held the prime ministership during this period. Historically, the Independence Party and the Progressive Party have alternated in power, but recent coalition dynamics have been complex[3].\n\n## Public and Economic Factors\n- The country is facing economic challenges such as high inflation and rising interest rates, compounded by recent volcanic eruptions. These factors could influence voter sentiment and the election outcome[3].\n\nGiven these points, it is not immediately clear whether the new Prime Minister will belong to the Progressive Party. The outcome depends on various factors including voter preferences, the performance of each party in the elections, and potential coalition formations post-election.\n\n### Key Considerations for Superforecasters:\n- **Base Rates**: Historical performance of the Progressive Party in Icelandic elections.\n- **Current State**: The impact of recent political and economic events on voter sentiment.\n- **Reference Classes**: Similar scenarios in Icelandic political history where coalition dynamics led to changes in government leadership.\n- **Time to Resolution**: The elections are scheduled for 30 November 2024, providing a clear timeline for resolution.\n\nWithout additional data on current polling, voter trends, and specific campaign strategies, it is challenging to predict with certainty whether the Progressive Party will secure the prime ministership.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there significant public dissatisfaction with the Independence Party that could benefit the Progressive Party in the elections?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not mention the Independence Party or the Progressive Party specifically, so it is impossible to determine from the given information whether there is significant public dissatisfaction with the Independence Party that could benefit the Progressive Party.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Progressive Party expected to gain more seats than any other party in the upcoming elections?\nANSWER: UNCLEAR.\n\nThe sources provided do not offer a comprehensive prediction or analysis of the overall seat gains for the Working Families Party (WFP) in comparison to other parties in the upcoming elections. While they discuss the WFP's strategies, endorsements, and past performances, they do not provide a clear forecast of whether the WFP will gain more seats than any other party[3][5][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Progressive Party currently leading in opinion polls for the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary elections?\nANSWER: NO\n\nThe Progressive Party is not leading in the opinion polls for the 2024 Icelandic parliamentary elections. According to the latest polls, the Social Democratic Alliance is currently polling the highest, while the Progressive Party is expected to receive significantly fewer votes, with some polls indicating they might only scrape together enough support to win a small number of seats[3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Progressive Party publicly declared its intention to seek the Prime Minister position after the elections?\nANSWER: The question pertains to the Progressive Party in Iceland, so we need to look at sources related to that specific party.\n\nBased on the information provided in the Wikipedia article about the Progressive Party of Iceland, there is no explicit mention of the party publicly declaring its intention to seek the Prime Minister position after a specific election. The article discusses various coalition governments and the party's participation in them, but it does not address the party's public declarations regarding seeking the Prime Minister position[1].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Progressive Party's popularity increased significantly since the last election?\nANSWER: The sources provided do not directly address the popularity of a \"Progressive Party\" as a distinct political party, but they do discuss the influence and popularity of progressive ideologies and groups within the Democratic Party.\n\n- The Pew Research Center and other sources highlight the increasing influence of progressive groups within the Democratic Party, such as the Progressive Left, and their high levels of political engagement and support for liberal policies[1][4].\n- However, these sources do not indicate the existence or growth of a separate \"Progressive Party\" as an independent entity.\n- The focus is on progressive movements and ideologies within the Democratic Party and their impact on local and national politics[2][4].\n\nGiven this, the question about the popularity of a \"Progressive Party\" as a separate entity remains unclear based on the provided sources.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the Progressive Party historically provided the Prime Minister in previous coalition governments?\nANSWER: Yes, the Progressive Party in Iceland has historically provided the Prime Minister in previous coalition governments.\n\nFor example, after the 1971 parliamentary election, Ólafur Jóhannesson of the Progressive Party served as prime minister in a coalition government[2].\n\nIn the 1980s, Steingrímur Hermannsson, the leader of the Progressive Party, became prime minister in coalition with the Independence Party and other parties[2].\n\nAdditionally, in the 2000s, Halldór Ásgrímsson of the Progressive Party took over as prime minister from Davíð Oddsson in 2004[2].\n\nAnd more recently, Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson of the Progressive Party was Prime Minister of Iceland from 2013 to 2016[2].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the leader of the Progressive Party favored by the public to become Prime Minister?\nANSWER: The query appears to be confusing because it mixes historical and current contexts. Here are the clarifications:\n\n- The Progressive Party mentioned in the historical context, particularly in the United States, was active in the early 20th century, with Theodore Roosevelt as its most notable figure. This party is not currently active or relevant to modern political leadership polls[4].\n\n- The current political landscape in Canada or other countries does not involve a prominent Progressive Party in the same historical sense. The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, for example, merged with the Canadian Alliance in 2003 to form the Conservative Party of Canada[1][3].\n\nGiven the information, there is no contemporary Progressive Party leader being considered or polled for the position of Prime Minister in the current political context.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**, as the question seems to conflate historical and current political scenarios without a clear reference to a specific, active Progressive Party.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have recent economic challenges increased public support for the Progressive Party's policies?\nANSWER: The information available suggests that recent economic challenges have indeed led to increased public support for policies aligned with progressive ideals, even if not specifically attributed to the historical Progressive Party.\n\n1. **Post-Great Recession**: The economic downturn of the late 2000s led to a resurgence in demand for progressive economic policies. The Occupy Wall Street movement and the rise of politicians like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who advocate for progressive taxation, universal healthcare, and other social welfare policies, indicate a growing public support for these ideas[3].\n\n2. **Current Progressive Agenda**: The contemporary Progressive Caucus in the U.S. Congress continues to advocate for policies aimed at reducing income inequality, expanding social services, and regulating industries, which aligns with the historical Progressive Party's goals. The ongoing support for these policies suggests that public sentiment remains favorable towards progressive reforms[2].\n\nWhile the historical Progressive Party itself is not directly mentioned in these contexts, the principles and policies it advocated for are seeing renewed support in response to current economic challenges. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a high likelihood that the Progressive Party will form a coalition with other parties to achieve a majority?\nANSWER: The likelihood of the Progressive Party forming a coalition to achieve a majority can vary depending on the specific context and the party in question.\n\n### Serbian Progressive Party\nIn the case of the Serbian Progressive Party, the recent local elections indicate that the party-led coalition already holds a significant majority in many cities and towns, including Belgrade and Novi Sad. Given their strong performance, there is less immediate need for them to form new coalitions to achieve a majority[1].\n\n### Democratic Progressive Party (Taiwan)\nFor the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan, the situation is different. While the party has recently lost its majority in the Legislative Yuan in the 2024 elections, historical contexts show that the party has formed coalitions as part of the Pan-Green Coalition. However, the current situation does not explicitly indicate a high likelihood of forming new coalitions immediately to regain a majority[3].\n\n### General Context on Coalitions\nIn general, parties may form coalitions to prevent other parties from gaining an absolute majority or to increase their electoral chances, especially in systems where proportional representation is used. However, the specific likelihood depends on the electoral context, the party's current position, and the willingness of other parties to form alliances[4].\n\nGiven the specific contexts provided, it is not clear that there is a high likelihood of the Progressive Party (either in Serbia or Taiwan) forming new coalitions to achieve a majority at this moment.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are the major parties, such as the Independence Party and the Left-Green Movement, experiencing a decline in support?\nANSWER: The query mentions the \"Independence Party\" and the \"Left-Green Movement,\" but these parties are not relevant to the context of the sources provided, which focus on the political landscape in the United States, specifically discussing the Democratic, Republican, and independent voter identifications.\n\nIn the context of the U.S. political parties discussed in the sources:\n\n- The Democratic Party is experiencing a decline in support, with a record-low 27% of voters identifying as Democrats in 2023[1][2].\n- The Republican Party also has a stable but not increasing support, with 27% of voters identifying as Republicans, which is not a decline but rather a stable figure compared to the Democrats' decline[1][2].\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question about the major parties in the U.S. context is:\n\n**YES**, the Democratic Party is experiencing a decline in support. However, the question's mention of the \"Independence Party\" and \"Left-Green Movement\" is unclear in this context, as these are not U.S. parties discussed in the sources.\n\nFor clarity, the answer is based on the U.S. political parties (Democratic and Republican) discussed in the sources. If the question is about different parties (Independence Party and Left-Green Movement), it would be **UNCLEAR** because these parties are not mentioned in the provided sources.",
    "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known:**\n\n- Today is **November 11, 2024**.\n- The parliamentary elections in Iceland are scheduled for **November 30, 2024**, which is in **19 days**.\n- According to the resolution criteria, if no new prime minister has received the mandate by **January 1, 2025**, the question will resolve as **No**.\n- This means the maximum time left until the outcome is known is approximately **50 days**.\n\n---\n\n(b) **What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\n\n- Current opinion polls indicate that the **Social Democratic Alliance** is leading the race.\n- The **Progressive Party** is not leading and is expected to secure a smaller number of seats.\n- Historically, while the Progressive Party has provided prime ministers in coalition governments, their current standing suggests this is unlikely.\n- Therefore, if nothing changed, the outcome would likely be **No**—the new prime minister will not belong to the Progressive Party.\n\n---\n\n(c) **What I would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\n\n- With approximately **12 days** left (a quarter of the 50-day maximum time frame), there would be minimal time for significant shifts in voter sentiment or party standings.\n- Given the current information, I would forecast a **probability of 10%** that the new prime minister will belong to the Progressive Party.\n\n---\n\n(d) **What I would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\n\n- With approximately **200 days** left (four times the 50-day maximum time frame), there would be more opportunity for political developments and changes in public opinion.\n- However, unless there are indications of a significant shift toward the Progressive Party, the probability might not increase substantially.\n- In this scenario, I would forecast a **probability of 20%** that the new prime minister will belong to the Progressive Party.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Current Polls and Party Standings:** The latest opinion polls show the **Social Democratic Alliance** leading. The Progressive Party is trailing and may only secure a small number of seats in the Althingi (Icelandic Parliament).\n\n- **Historical Context:** The Progressive Party has historically been influential and has provided prime ministers in previous coalition governments. However, their current lower polling numbers reduce the likelihood of their leader becoming prime minister.\n\n- **Coalition Dynamics:** Iceland's political system often requires coalition governments due to proportional representation. While it is possible for a party not leading in the polls to secure the prime ministership through coalition agreements, this is less likely if they have a significantly smaller number of seats.\n\n- **Economic and Political Factors:** Economic challenges such as high inflation and rising interest rates could sway voter sentiment. However, there is no clear indication that these factors are significantly boosting support for the Progressive Party over other parties.\n\n- **Time for Change:** With limited time before the election, significant changes in party popularity are less probable. Major shifts in public opinion typically require more time or significant events.\n\n---\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
