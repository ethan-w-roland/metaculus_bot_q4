    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the year-over-year increase in prices of homes in Dallas, TX in November 2024 be greater than or equal to 0.0%, according to Zillow?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Zillow reports in its [Housing Data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) resource page that its Zillow Home Value Index, Raw  for Dallas, TX has risen by â‰¥0.0% for November 2024. If this does not occur, then this resolves as **No**. The figure can be accessed either through observing the Zillow Zillow Home Value Index, Raw (ZHVI) chart or through the CSV file. To download the CSV, under HOME VALUES, make sure Data Type is set to \"ZHVI All Homes (SFR, Condo/Co-op) Time Series, Raw, Mid-Tier ($)\" and Geography is set to \"Metro & U.S.\" The RegionName \"Dallas, TX\" in the CSV will be used, specifically by looking at the year-over-year increase from November 2023 to November 2024. (First divide current value by prior value, then subtract one, then multiply by 100%.)\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nPlease note that the instructions on how to access the CSV are provided for convenience only; according to Zillow, \"We make frequent changes to the download paths for CSVs.\" In the event the location of the data has changed, the question resolves based on the new location. The question will resolve as soon as the data is accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after the resolution date and the data has been reported. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to January 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. In the event the chart and CSV report different figures, the CSV will take precedence.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAccording to Zillow, housing data is updated on the 12th of each month. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo determine if the year-over-year increase in home prices in Dallas, TX in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 0.0% according to Zillow, here are some relevant points from the available sources:\n\n## Current Trends and Forecasts\n- As of July 2024, Zillow reported that the average home value in Dallas, TX had increased by 1.4% over the past year[4].\n- However, more recent forecasts and reports suggest a moderation or slight decline in home price growth. For example, one report indicates a slight dip in home values, with an expected 0.2% decrease by October 2024 and further declines projected into 2025[5].\n\n## Specific Data for November 2024\n- There is no specific data provided for November 2024 in the sources. The latest data available is up to October 2024 or earlier.\n\n## General Market Conditions\n- The Dallas housing market is experiencing a slowdown in growth compared to previous years. While single-family homes are holding their ground, other segments like townhomes and condos are seeing a decline in sales[5].\n\nGiven the lack of specific data for November 2024 and the general trend of moderating growth or slight declines, it is not clear whether the year-over-year increase in home prices in Dallas, TX in November 2024 will be greater than or equal to 0.0% according to Zillow. The answer cannot be definitively determined from the available information.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Dallas, TX experienced a population growth of more than 1% between November 2023 and November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data available for the population growth of Dallas, TX between November 2023 and November 2024. The sources provide population estimates and growth data up to 2023 and some projections or estimates for early 2024, but they do not include the specific time frame from November 2023 to November 2024.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have construction permits for new homes in Dallas, TX increased year-over-year as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is not enough information to determine whether construction permits for new homes in Dallas, TX have increased year-over-year as of November 2024.\n\n- The sources provide data for specific months (June 2024 and January 2024) but do not offer a year-over-year comparison or data for November 2024[1][2].\n- Therefore, the answer to whether construction permits have increased year-over-year as of November 2024 is UNCLEAR.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did Zillow report a year-over-year increase in home prices in Dallas, TX in July 2024?\nANSWER: No, Zillow did not report a year-over-year increase in home prices in Dallas, TX in July 2024. According to the sources, Dallas, TX experienced a year-over-year decrease or very slight increase, but not a significant increase.\n\n- One source indicates that the average home value in Dallas, TX was up 1.4% over the past year as of July 31, 2024, but this is a relatively small increase[1].\n- Another source specifies that Dallas, TX saw a year-over-year home price decline of -0.3% over the past 12 months[5].\n\nTherefore, the year-over-year change was either a small increase or a slight decrease, but not a significant increase.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the median household income in Dallas, TX increased year-over-year as of November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no specific data or update as of November 2024 that directly addresses the year-over-year change in median household income for Dallas, TX, for the current year.\n\n- The most recent data provided in the sources is from 2023 and earlier years, and it does not include updates or comparisons for the year 2024[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether the median household income in Dallas, TX has increased year-over-year as of November 2024 is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the unemployment rate in Dallas, TX decrease between November 2023 and November 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if the unemployment rate in Dallas, TX decreased between November 2023 and November 2024, we need to compare the unemployment rates for these two periods.\n\n## November 2023:\n- The unemployment rate for Dallas, TX in November 2023 was 3.70%[1].\n\n## November 2024:\n- The most recent data provided shows the unemployment rate for Dallas, TX as of October 2024 was 4.00%, but it does not provide the exact rate for November 2024. However, the trend and nearby data points suggest stability or slight variations. Since the exact November 2024 rate is not provided, we cannot definitively say it decreased, but based on the nearby months, it seems to be around the same level or slightly higher than the previous year[1][4].\n\nGiven the lack of specific data for November 2024, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did any major economic events occur in Dallas, TX between November 2023 and November 2024 that significantly impacted the housing market?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there are several economic and related events listed in Dallas, TX, between November 2023 and November 2024, but none of them specifically mention a significant impact on the housing market.\n\nHere are some relevant events from the sources:\n\n- **Not Your Typical Cycle: Where Does Real Estate Go From Here?** on May 8, 2024, at the Dallas Fed, which discusses real estate but does not specify any significant impact on the housing market during this period[2].\n- **Texas Economic Outlook 2024** on February 9, 2024, which is a general economic outlook and does not specifically focus on the housing market[2].\n- Other events listed are more general or do not directly address the housing market.\n\nGiven the information, it is unclear if any of these events significantly impacted the housing market.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the housing inventory in Dallas, TX higher in November 2024 compared to November 2023?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here are the relevant points:\n\n- The number of homes for sale in Dallas increased from September 2024 to October 2024, with 5,741 homes for sale in October 2024, which is a 13.5% increase from September 2024[1].\n- The overall trend shows an increase in housing inventory, with active listings in the Dallas-Fort Worth area increasing significantly. For example, in October 2024, the active listings were up by 35.16% year-over-year[2].\n- While the sources do not provide a direct comparison between November 2024 and November 2023, they consistently indicate that the housing inventory has been increasing over the past year. This suggests that the inventory in November 2024 is likely higher than in November 2023 due to the ongoing trend of increasing inventory levels.\n\nGiven this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the housing inventory in Dallas, TX is higher in November 2024 compared to November 2023.\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Did the average time on market for homes in Dallas, TX decrease between November 2023 and November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the information about the average time on market for homes in Dallas, TX, between November 2023 and November 2024 is not directly comparable, but here are some relevant points:\n\n- In December 2023, the median time homes spent on the market in the Dallas metro area was 62 days, which was a decrease by one day year over year[1].\n- By September 2024, the average days to sell a property had increased slightly to 86 days, up from 76 days in September 2023[4].\n- In October 2024, homes in Dallas were selling after an average of 45 days on the market, compared to 31 days the previous year[2].\n\nSince the specific data for November 2023 and November 2024 is not provided, and the available data shows mixed trends at different times of the year, it is unclear whether the average time on market decreased specifically between these two months.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have mortgage interest rates in the United States increased between November 2023 and November 2024?\nANSWER: To determine if mortgage interest rates in the United States have increased between November 2023 and November 2024, we need to compare the rates from these two periods.\n\n### November 2023:\n- While the specific mortgage rates for November 2023 are not provided in the sources, we know from the context that the Federal Reserve had maintained the federal funds rate at its peak level since July 2023, and mortgage rates had been influenced by the Fed's rate increases over the preceding years. However, the exact mortgage rates for November 2023 are not specified[2].\n\n### November 2024:\n- As of November 2024, the average 30-year mortgage rate was around 6.88%[2][3].\n- It is mentioned that rates had surged after a dip in September 2024, when the 30-year average had plunged to a 2-year low of 5.89%[2].\n\nGiven the information:\n- In September 2024, rates were at a 2-year low, but they have since surged back up to around 6.88% by November 2024.\n- There is no direct comparison provided between November 2023 and November 2024, but it is clear that rates had been high in 2023 due to the Fed's rate increases and were still elevated in November 2024.\n\nSince the sources do not provide a direct comparison of the exact rates in November 2023 to those in November 2024, but indicate that rates were high and influenced by Fed actions in both periods, we cannot definitively conclude the direction of change.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any significant policy changes affecting the housing market in Dallas, TX between November 2023 and November 2024?\nANSWER: Between November 2023 and November 2024, there have been several policy initiatives and changes that could impact the housing market in Dallas, TX, although some of these may have been in the works or announced prior to this period. Here are the key points:\n\n## Federal Housing Policies\n- The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced updates to Fannie Mae and Freddie Macâ€™s Equitable Housing Finance Plans in 2023, which aim to provide equitable access to affordable and sustainable housing. These plans include actions to remove barriers for Latino renters and homeowners, support for locally-owned modular construction in communities of color, and the inclusion of rental payments and cash flow in automated underwriting systems. While these changes were announced in 2023, they would likely continue to influence the housing market in 2024[2].\n\n## State and Local Policies in Texas\n- The Texas legislature introduced several new bills to address the housing affordability crisis. These proposals include allowing builders to use less land for single-family homes, easing city housing regulations, and creating a state housing tax credit to supplement the federal program. Additionally, there are proposals to set up a state fund to finance housing for middle-income workers like teachers and healthcare workers. These initiatives are aimed at speeding up the construction of new homes and apartments[2].\n\n## Government Incentives and Financing Options\n- While there are no new significant direct incentives for homebuyers in Dallas specifically mentioned, federal programs like FHA loans or USDA loans continue to be available for first-time homebuyers with lower down payments or more lenient credit requirements. The absence of a state income tax in Texas also remains a attractive factor for new residents[4].\n\nIn summary, while the specific period between November 2023 and November 2024 does not see the introduction of entirely new policy changes, ongoing and previously announced federal and state initiatives continue to shape the housing market in Dallas.\n\n**YES**",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**\nAs of today's date, November 25, 2024, Zillow typically updates its Housing Data on the 12th of each month. Therefore, the data for November 2024 would have been released on November 12, 2024. This means that the outcome is either already known or will be available within the next few days if not yet accessed by Metaculus Admins.\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**\nIf the current trends continued without any significant changes, the year-over-year increase in home prices in Dallas, TX for November 2024 would likely hover around 0.0%. Given the slight increases observed in mid-year and the moderating trends leading up to November, it's reasonable to expect that the percentage change would be marginally positive or neutral.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**\nWith only a quarter of the time left, the data would still trend towards a slight increase or stabilization. The probability of a year-over-year increase being â‰¥0.0% would be higher due to the limited time for any adverse factors to influence the outcome.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**\nIf there were four times the time left, there would be more opportunities for market fluctuations, economic changes, or policy impacts to affect home prices. This increased uncertainty would likely decrease the probability of a year-over-year increase being â‰¥0.0%.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe Dallas housing market has shown signs of slowing growth, with slight increases in mid-year followed by forecasts of moderation or minor declines approaching November 2024. Factors such as rising mortgage interest rates (averaging around 6.88%), increasing housing inventory, and ongoing policy changes aimed at addressing housing affordability contribute to a stabilized or slightly declining market. Although the average home value saw a 1.4% increase in July 2024, subsequent data indicated a potential dip. Given these mixed indicators, the likelihood of the year-over-year increase being at least 0.0% is moderately favorable but not overwhelmingly so.\n\n**Probability: 55%**",
