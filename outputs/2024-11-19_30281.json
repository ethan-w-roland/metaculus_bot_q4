    "prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill the number of active US oil drilling rigs exceed 590 on December 27, 2024?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-11-19\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of active oil drilling rigs exceeds 590 on December 27, 2024, according to the Baker Hughes North American Rotary Rig Count, which can be accessed at [this](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_rotary_rigs) Ycharts link. \n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nThe link will be accessed by Metaculus Admins on or around December 28, 2024. In case of its inaccessibility, the secondary resolution source will be from Baker Hughes itself at [this link](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count). If both resolution links remain inaccessible by the end of the tournament, the question will be **annulled**.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBaker Hughes [issues](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/) US oil rig counts every Friday, and issued oil rig counts to the petroleum industry since 1944. \n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo make an informed prediction about whether the number of active US oil drilling rigs will exceed 590 on December 27, 2024, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Current Rig Count\nAs of the latest data available up to November 8, 2024, the US rig count stands at 585, which is down from 618 a year ago[1].\n\n## Recent Trends\nThe rig count has been relatively stable in recent weeks, with minor fluctuations. For example, the count remained unchanged at 585 for several weeks leading up to November 8, 2024[1].\n\n## Historical Context\nThe US rig count has experienced significant fluctuations in response to oil prices and technological advancements. In the mid-2010s, the count dropped to a low of 404 in May 2016 but rebounded as oil prices rose and drilling technology improved[1].\n\n## Regional Activity\nDifferent regions have shown varying levels of activity. For instance, Texas leads with 274 rigs, while other states like New Mexico, North Dakota, and Louisiana also have significant numbers. Some regions, such as the Permian Basin, have seen slight increases or stability in rig counts[2][4].\n\n## Predictive Questions\nSimilar predictive questions on Metaculus regarding the rig count on November 29, 2024, have been annulled, indicating that the actual outcome was not determined or reported within the context of those questions[3][5].\n\n## Base Rates and Time to Resolution\nGiven the current stability and the historical context, predicting a significant increase to exceed 590 rigs within a short period (from November 8 to December 27) would require substantial changes in market conditions, such as a sharp rise in oil prices or significant technological breakthroughs.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile it is possible for the rig count to increase, the current trends and historical data do not strongly suggest a rapid increase to exceed 590 rigs by December 27, 2024. However, this question cannot be clearly answered as yes or no based on the available information, as it depends on future market and economic conditions. Therefore, forecasters should consider the current stability, historical trends, and potential future factors that could influence the rig count.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Texas currently the state with the highest number of active oil drilling rigs in the US?\nANSWER: YES.\n\nAccording to the latest Baker Hughes rig report, as of November 18, 2024, Texas has the highest number of active drilling rigs, with a total of 279 rigs[3]. This confirms that Texas continues to dominate the rig count in the U.S.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US oil rig count exceeded 590 at any point in the past year?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is evidence that the US oil rig count did exceed 590 at some point in the past year.\n\nIn the source from OK Energy Today, it is mentioned that \"Nationally, the count increased by 8 rigs, reaching a total of 590\" in a report from September 2024[3].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**YES**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the current US oil rig count greater than 580?\nANSWER: Based on the most recent data provided:\n\n- The US Oil Rig Count as of November 8, 2024, is 479[5].\n- The total US rig count, which includes both oil and gas rigs, is 585 as of November 8, 2024[4].\n\nSince the specific question is about the US oil rig count, the current count of 479 is less than 580.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has there been any significant policy change affecting oil drilling in the US since November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no clear evidence of significant policy changes affecting oil drilling in the US specifically since November 2024.\n\n- The sources discuss policies and changes up to 2024, including the Biden administration's actions and proposed changes by the upcoming Trump administration, but they do not provide information on new policy changes implemented after November 2024[1][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has the US oil rig count increased in the last four weeks?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, here is the analysis:\n\n- As of November 8, 2024, the US oil rig count was 479, and it remained unchanged from the previous week[1][3][5].\n- By November 15, 2024, the US oil rig count had decreased by one rig to 478[4].\n\nThere is no indication that the US oil rig count has increased over the last four weeks; instead, it has either remained stable or decreased slightly.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any major natural disasters impacting oil drilling operations in the US recently?\nANSWER: YES\n\nRecent sources indicate that hurricanes have had a significant impact on oil drilling operations in the US. For example:\n\n- Hurricane Francine made landfall on the Louisiana coast and took some energy infrastructure offline, affecting offshore oil and natural gas production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico[2].\n- Hurricane Beryl, although it weakened quickly, still had effects on energy infrastructure along the U.S. Gulf Coast[2].\n- The forecast for an especially active Atlantic hurricane season in 2024 raises concerns about weather-related disruptions in the US oil and natural gas sector, including the potential for evacuations and temporary halts in production[4][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have oil prices risen by more than 10% since November 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the answer is NO.\n\nAs of mid-November 2024, the Brent crude oil price was around $71-72 per barrel[3][5].\n\nBy the forecasts and data provided, there is no indication that oil prices have risen by more than 10% since then. In fact, the prices have remained relatively stable or have seen minor fluctuations. For example, the Brent crude oil price was expected to rise to an average of $78 per barrel in the first quarter of 2025, but this does not represent a more than 10% increase from the mid-November 2024 prices[5].\n\nTherefore, the evidence does not support a rise of more than 10% in oil prices since November 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the Permian Basin projected to add more active drilling rigs by the end of 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the projection for the number of active drilling rigs in the Permian Basin by the end of 2024 is not positive.\n\n- According to East Daley, the Permian Basin is expected to drop another 10 rigs by the end of 2026, and the rig count is anticipated to level off at around 280 rigs. For 2024, the average rig count is expected to be around 292, but there is no indication of an increase by the end of the year; instead, there is a mention of a decrease in rig count[2].\n\n- The EIA report also discusses the efficiency and productivity gains but does not indicate an increase in the number of active rigs. It mentions that despite a decline in the number of active rigs since late 2022, production has been increasing due to other factors such as well productivity and completion of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs)[4].\n\nTherefore, the evidence suggests that the Permian Basin is not projected to add more active drilling rigs by the end of 2024.\n\n**NO**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any expected geopolitical events that could influence US oil prices by December 2024?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several geopolitical events and factors that could influence US oil prices by December 2024:\n\n1. **Concerns about a war between Israel and Iran**: This potential conflict is mentioned as a source of oil price uncertainty and could disrupt global oil exports, affecting oil prices[1].\n\n2. **OPEC+ production decisions**: OPEC+ has announced delays in production increases until December, which could impact global oil supply and prices. Any changes or decisions made by OPEC+ can significantly influence oil prices[1][5].\n\n3. **Global access to Russian oil**: Efforts to tighten the G7 price cap and Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil infrastructure could disrupt oil supplies and impact prices[1].\n\n4. **Political instability in major oil-producing regions**: Geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, can lead to supply disruptions and affect oil prices[3].\n\n5. **Sanctions on countries like Iran**: These sanctions can reduce global oil supply, driving up prices[3].\n\nThese factors indicate that geopolitical events are expected to continue influencing oil prices through the end of 2024.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have there been any recent technological advancements in oil drilling in the US?\nANSWER: Yes, there have been several recent technological advancements in oil drilling in the US.\n\n1. **Hydraulic Fracturing (Fracking) and Horizontal Drilling**: These technologies have revolutionized the industry by enabling access to previously untapped oil and gas reserves, particularly in shale formations like the Permian Basin and the Bakken Formation[3][4].\n\n2. **Big Data and Advanced Analytics**: The use of big data and machine learning algorithms has improved operational efficiency, predictive maintenance, and the identification of new oil and gas reserves[1][4].\n\n3. **Robotics and Automation**: Robotic systems and automated drilling rigs have enhanced safety, precision, and efficiency in drilling operations, reducing the need for human intervention in hazardous environments[1][2].\n\n4. **Seismic Imaging**: This technology allows for more accurate exploration and identification of oil and gas deposits by generating images of rock formations using sound waves[1].\n\n5. **Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Drones**: These are used for inspections, maintenance, and data collection in both onshore and offshore operations, improving safety and reducing costs[1][2].\n\n6. **Deepwater Drilling Innovations**: Advances such as dynamic positioning systems, advanced blowout preventers, and real-time data analytics have improved the efficiency, safety, and environmental sustainability of deepwater drilling operations[5].\n\nThese advancements have significantly contributed to the increase in US crude oil production and have transformed the oil and gas industry in terms of efficiency, safety, and sustainability.",
    "comment": "**(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n38 days (from November 19, 2024, to December 27, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \n**No.** If current conditions remain stable without any significant changes in oil prices, policies, or technological advancements, the number of active US oil drilling rigs is likely to remain around 585 or possibly decrease slightly, staying below 590.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith approximately 9-10 days remaining, there would be limited opportunity for substantial increases in rig counts. **Probability would be lower**, likely around 20%.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith approximately 152 days (over five months) remaining, there would be ample time for changes in oil prices, policies, or other factors to influence rig counts significantly. **Probability would be higher**, potentially around 60%.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nGiven the current rig count of 585 as of November 8, 2024, and observing recent trends of stability or slight decreases, the likelihood of exceeding 590 rigs by December 27, 2024, appears modest. Several factors influence this probability:\n\n1. **Recent Trends:** The rig count has been stable or slightly declining in the weeks leading up to November 19, 2024. For an increase to over 590 rigs, a notable uptick in oil prices or favorable policy changes would be required within the relatively short 38-day window.\n\n2. **Oil Prices:** There has not been a significant rise (over 10%) in oil prices since November 2024. While geopolitical events could influence prices, the current outlook suggests moderate or stable price levels, which may not sufficiently incentivize a substantial increase in rig counts.\n\n3. **Geopolitical and Environmental Factors:** Recent hurricanes have disrupted drilling operations, and ongoing geopolitical tensions (e.g., potential conflicts involving major oil producers) introduce uncertainty that could either hamper or momentarily boost rig activity depending on developments.\n\n4. **Technological Advancements:** While technological improvements can enhance drilling efficiency, they typically contribute to sustained or gradual changes in rig counts rather than sharp increases within short time frames.\n\n5. **Regional Dynamics:** The Permian Basin, a significant contributor to US rig counts, is not projected to add rigs by the end of 2024. Other regions show similar stability, limiting the potential for overall rig count increases.\n\n6. **Subquestion Insights:** Notably, the rig count has not shown recent increases and has even decreased slightly, reinforcing the likelihood that significant growth to exceed 590 rigs is unlikely without unexpected changes.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of the US oil rig count exceeding 590 by December 27, 2024, stands at a moderate level, balancing the potential for slight increases against prevailing trends and constraints.\n\n**Probability: 35%**",
