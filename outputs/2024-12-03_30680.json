However, it has since evolved to include a for-profit subsidiary, OpenAI Global, LLC, and other entities like OpenAI LP, a for-profit limited partnership[1][3].\n\n## Nonprofit and For-Profit Components\nThe nonprofit component, OpenAI, Inc., is still in existence and controls the for-profit entities through its board and ownership structures. However, the for-profit components, such as OpenAI Global, LLC and OpenAI LP, are not exempt entities in the traditional sense[1][3].\n\n## Public Benefit Corporation Plans\nOpenAI is planning to restructure into a public benefit corporation, which is a different legal structure from a traditional nonprofit. This restructuring does not necessarily imply an exempt status in the same way a nonprofit would have[2].\n\n## Delaware Corporation Listings\nDelaware's Division of Corporations typically lists entities based on their legal status, such as corporations, LLCs, or limited partnerships. Exempt status is usually associated with nonprofit organizations that meet specific federal and state tax-exempt criteria. Given that OpenAI's primary operating entities are transitioning towards for-profit and public benefit corporation structures, it is unlikely that the entire organization would be listed as an \"Exempt\" entity[4][5].\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the current structure and the planned restructuring, it is unlikely that the state of Delaware's Division of Corporations would list OpenAI as an \"Exempt\" entity on December 31, 2024, given the significant for-profit components and the transition towards a public benefit corporation model. However, the exact listing would depend on the specific legal status of each entity within the OpenAI structure at that time.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI announced plans to restructure into a public benefit corporation?\nANSWER: YES\n\nOpenAI has announced plans to restructure into a public benefit corporation. This is reported in multiple sources, including articles from Maginative, Business Insider, and Complex Discovery, which all confirm that OpenAI is transitioning from its current nonprofit structure to a for-profit public benefit corporation[1][2][4].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI publicly disclosed its intent to seek or maintain \"Exempt\" status with the Delaware Division of Corporations?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that OpenAI has publicly disclosed its intent to seek or maintain \"Exempt\" status with the Delaware Division of Corporations. The sources discuss OpenAI's plans to restructure into a public benefit corporation and the implications of Delaware's public benefit corporation law, but they do not mention anything about seeking exempt status[1][3][5].\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is OpenAI, Inc. currently registered as a nonprofit organization in Delaware?\nANSWER: OpenAI, Inc., the original entity, is still registered as a nonprofit organization in Delaware, although its structure has evolved to include for-profit components.\n\n- OpenAI started as a tax-exempt, nonprofit company organized in Delaware and is still controlled by a nonprofit board[1][3][5].\n- Despite the creation of for-profit subsidiaries like OpenAI LP and OpenAI Global, LLC, the nonprofit element of OpenAI, Inc. continues to exist and retains control over the overall mission and structure[1][4][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is **YES**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Delaware's Division of Corporations updated its criteria for \"Exempt\" status for entities in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication that Delaware's Division of Corporations has updated its criteria for \"Exempt\" status for entities in 2024. The sources outline the existing requirements and processes for forming and maintaining a nonprofit corporation in Delaware, but they do not mention any changes or updates to the criteria for exempt status in 2024[2][3][4].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI filed for a change in its corporate structure with the Delaware Division of Corporations in 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it is unclear whether OpenAI has formally filed for a change in its corporate structure with the Delaware Division of Corporations in 2024.\n\nWhile the sources indicate that OpenAI is considering a corporate restructure, including the possibility of becoming a public benefit corporation or a for-profit entity[1][2][3], they do not specify that the necessary filings have been made with the Delaware Division of Corporations.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are OpenAI's subsidiaries, such as OpenAI Global, LLC and OpenAI LP, classified as for-profit entities in Delaware?\nANSWER: Yes, OpenAI's subsidiaries, such as OpenAI Global, LLC and OpenAI LP, are classified as for-profit entities in Delaware.\n\n- OpenAI Global, LLC was introduced in 2019 as a for-profit subsidiary, allowing the company to attract investment and grant employees stakes in the company[5].\n- OpenAI LP is a for-profit limited partnership, which was created to allow for private investments while still being governed by the nonprofit OpenAIâ€™s board and operated in accordance with its charitable purposes[1][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Does Delaware law currently permit public benefit corporations to be listed as \"Exempt\" entities?\nANSWER: No, Delaware law does not permit public benefit corporations to be listed as \"Exempt\" entities in the context of tax exemption. Public Benefit Corporations (PBCs) in Delaware are for-profit corporations that do not qualify for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status. They are required to pay taxes on their profits, just like any other for-profit corporation, and they file tax returns using Form 1120[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has OpenAI applied for or received any tax-exempt status recognition from Delaware in 2024?\nANSWER: OpenAI's tax-exempt status is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) at the federal level, but the question specifically asks about recognition from Delaware in 2024.\n\nDelaware, as the state of incorporation, does not grant tax-exempt status in the same way the IRS does. Instead, Delaware requires nonprofits to comply with state laws and regulations. The sources provided do not indicate that OpenAI has applied for or received any new tax-exempt status recognition specifically from Delaware in 2024. They discuss ongoing regulatory scrutiny and potential changes in OpenAI's corporate structure, but do not mention a new application or recognition from Delaware[1][3][5].\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is OpenAI, Inc. actively maintaining its compliance with nonprofit requirements as of December 2024?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, it appears that OpenAI, Inc. is facing significant questions and challenges regarding its compliance with nonprofit requirements.\n\n- There are allegations and concerns that OpenAI, Inc. has abandoned its nonprofit mission and is instead being controlled by its for-profit affiliate, which raises questions about its compliance with nonprofit obligations[1][2][3].\n- Elon Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI, Inc. also highlights issues related to the company's adherence to its nonprofit purpose[1][2].\n- The potential conversion of OpenAI, Inc. from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity is under scrutiny, with concerns about whether the process will comply with tax laws and protect public interests[2][3].\n\nGiven these points, it is unclear whether OpenAI, Inc. is actively maintaining its compliance with nonprofit requirements as of December 2024.\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Are there any pending legal actions or disputes involving OpenAI that could affect its exempt status in Delaware?\nANSWER: Yes, there are several pending legal actions and disputes involving OpenAI that could have implications for its status in Delaware.\n\n1. **Copyright Infringement Suits**: OpenAI is facing multiple lawsuits, including those from the New York Times, Alternet, Raw Story, and others, alleging copyright infringement related to the training of its large language models. While these suits do not directly target its corporate status, they could influence public and regulatory perception[3].\n\n2. **Breach of Contract and Unfair Competition**: Elon Musk has sued OpenAI and its founder Sam Altman, alleging that OpenAI breached a founding agreement by transitioning from a non-profit to a for-profit model. This dispute could impact how OpenAI's governance and mission are viewed by regulators[3].\n\n3. **Delaware Attorney General Inquiry**: The Delaware Attorney General has sent a letter to OpenAI's lawyers seeking more information about the company's plan to convert from a non-profit to a for-profit public benefit corporation. This inquiry suggests that there is scrutiny over how this change might affect OpenAI's compliance with Delaware's corporate laws[5].\n\n4. **Potential Charter Revocation**: There is an argument made by some experts that Delaware could revoke OpenAI's corporate charter due to the potential risks posed by its AI models, including the creation of bioweapons. While this is not a current legal action, it highlights a potential risk to OpenAI's charter in Delaware[2].\n\nThese ongoing disputes and inquiries indicate that there are indeed legal and regulatory challenges that could affect OpenAI's status in Delaware.",
    "comment": "**(a) Time left until the outcome to the question is known:**  \n28 days (from December 3, 2024, to December 31, 2024).\n\n**(b) What the outcome would be if nothing changed:**  \nIf OpenAI's organizational structure and corporate filings remain unchanged, OpenAI would **not** be listed as an \"Exempt\" entity. This is because the existing for-profit subsidiaries and the transition to a public benefit corporation do not qualify for \"Exempt\" status under Delaware's criteria.\n\n**(c) What you would forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left:**  \nWith only 7 days remaining, the likelihood of significant structural changes or filings that would alter OpenAI's status to \"Exempt\" is minimal. Therefore, the probability that OpenAI is listed as \"Exempt\" remains very low, around **10%**.\n\n**(d) What you would forecast if there was 4x the time left:**  \nWith approximately 112 days, there would be ample time for OpenAI to make necessary filings or adjustments to attain \"Exempt\" status if they chose to pursue it. However, given the current trajectory towards a public benefit corporation and existing for-profit structures, the probability remains low but slightly higher, around **20%**.\n\n**Rationale:**  \nOpenAI's transition from a nonprofit to a structure that includes for-profit entities and potentially a public benefit corporation suggests that attaining \"Exempt\" status in Delaware is unlikely. The presence of for-profit subsidiaries like OpenAI Global, LLC and OpenAI LP, coupled with ongoing legal inquiries and the lack of public disclosures regarding seeking \"Exempt\" status, further diminish the chances. While organizational changes could theoretically influence their status, the current direction and regulatory scrutiny make it improbable that OpenAI would be listed as \"Exempt\" by December 31, 2024.\n\n**Probability: 15%**",
