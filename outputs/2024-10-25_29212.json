{"prompt": "QUESTION:\nWill Republican Congressman David Schweikert be re-elected in Arizona's 1st Congressional District in the 2024 election?\n\nTODAY'S DATE:\n2024-10-25\n\nRESOLUTION CRITERIA:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if David Schweikert wins the election to the House of Representatives from Arizona's 1st Congressional District in the 2024 US general election. If any other candidate wins, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nADDITIONAL CRITERIA:\nResolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) including media projections.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nBallotpedia: [Arizona's 1st Congressional District](https://ballotpedia.org/Arizona%27s_1st_Congressional_District). The 2024 US general election is scheduled for November 5, 2024.\n\nADDITIONAL BACKGROUND:\nTo assess the likelihood of Republican Congressman David Schweikert being re-elected in Arizona's 1st Congressional District in the 2024 election, here are some key points to consider:\n\n## Competitive District\nArizona's 1st Congressional District is considered a battleground district. Following redistricting after the 2020 census, the district's voting demographics shifted, making it a closely contested area. In the 2020 presidential election, this district would have voted for President Joe Biden (D) 50.1%-48.6%, indicating a narrow margin.\n\n## Recent Election History\nIn the 2022 election, Schweikert won the district by a very narrow margin of just 3,200 votes against a relatively unknown Democratic candidate who received minimal national support.\n\n## Current Election Dynamics\nFor the 2024 election, Schweikert is facing Amish Shah, a physician and former Arizona state representative who emerged from a crowded Democratic primary. The House Majority PAC is planning to spend more than $6 million on ads in support of Shah, while the Congressional Leadership Fund is spending about $4.9 million in support of Schweikert.\n\n## Election Forecasts\nAs of recent updates, major election forecasters have rated this election as either a toss-up or leaning slightly towards the Republicans. Specifically, two forecasters rate it as a toss-up, one as Tilt Republican, and one as Lean Republican.\n\n## Base Rates and Historical Context\nSchweikert has been in Congress since 2010 and has a history of winning close elections, particularly in the 2012 primary against fellow GOP incumbent Benjamin Quayle and in the 2022 general election. However, the district's new boundaries and increased Democratic spending could impact the outcome.\n\nGiven these factors, while it is difficult to predict the outcome with certainty, the election is highly competitive and could go either way. The narrow margins in previous elections and the significant spending by both parties indicate that the result will likely be close. Therefore, the answer to whether David Schweikert will be re-elected is not immediately clear and depends on various factors that will play out in the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nRELEVANT SUBQUESTIONS:\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Amish Shah overtaken David Schweikert in recent polling for Arizona's 1st Congressional District in the 2024 election?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not include specific recent polling data that shows Amish Shah overtaking David Schweikert in the 2024 election for Arizona's 1st Congressional District. The sources describe the race as highly competitive and a toss-up, but they do not provide the latest polling numbers that would indicate whether Shah has taken the lead.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has Amish Shah received significant endorsements from prominent Democratic figures or organizations for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Yes, Amish Shah has received significant endorsements from prominent Democratic figures and organizations for the 2024 election.\n\n- He has been endorsed by MoveOn, a prominent progressive organization.\n- He has received endorsements from the New Democrat Coalition Action Fund, which is a significant Democratic coalition.\n- He has also been endorsed by other notable organizations such as the American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists, the Arizona Police Association, and the Arizona Medical Political Action Committee.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Have voter registration numbers in Arizona's 1st Congressional District increased significantly for Democrats since the last election?\nANSWER: The provided sources do not offer direct comparisons of voter registration numbers for Democrats in Arizona's 1st Congressional District between the last election and the current period. The sources provide details on election results, candidate information, and some voter registration statistics, but they do not specifically compare the voter registration numbers over time for Democrats in this district.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether voter registration numbers for Democrats in Arizona's 1st Congressional District have increased significantly since the last election is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is Amish Shah outpacing David Schweikert in fundraising for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, the information about the current fundraising standings between Amish Shah and David Schweikert for the 2024 election is not up-to-date or clear.\n\n- The sources provide details about the primary and early fundraising figures. For example, in Q1, Amish Shah raised over $530,000, but this does not reflect the current or total fundraising for the entire election cycle.\n- There is no recent data in the sources provided that compares the total fundraising amounts for both candidates as of the latest period.\n\nTherefore, the answer is **UNCLEAR**.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has David Schweikert received significant endorsements from prominent Republican figures for the 2024 election?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no mention of significant endorsements from prominent Republican figures specifically for the 2024 election. Here are the key points:\n\n- The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has endorsed David Schweikert, but this is an organization rather than a prominent Republican figure.\n- The Humane Society Legislative Fund has also endorsed him, but again, this is an organization and not a Republican figure.\n- There is no mention of endorsements from prominent Republican figures such as other politicians or party leaders.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Has David Schweikert been involved in any scandals or ethics investigations since 2022 that could affect his re-election chances?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no evidence of new scandals or ethics investigations involving David Schweikert that have occurred since 2022. The sources primarily discuss the ethics violations and fines that were already resolved by 2022, including the $50,000 fine from the House Ethics Committee and the $125,000 fine from the Federal Election Commission.\n\nHowever, there is mention of a settlement in 2024 related to litigation over campaign materials from the 2022 campaign, but this does not constitute a new ethics investigation or scandal since 2022.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR** (as there are no new scandals or ethics investigations mentioned since 2022).\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Do major election forecasters rate the 2024 Arizona's 1st Congressional District election as leaning Democratic?\nANSWER: No, major election forecasters do not rate the 2024 Arizona's 1st Congressional District election as leaning Democratic.\n\n- The Hill's Election Center forecast gives David Schweikert (R) a 70% chance of winning and Amish Shah (D) a 30% chance, indicating the election is leaning Republican.\n- The Cook Partisan Voter Index also shows the district as R+2, suggesting a slight Republican lean.\n- Polling averages and forecasts from other sources similarly do not indicate a Democratic lean.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is there a significant third-party candidate in the 2024 election for Arizona's 1st Congressional District that could affect the outcome?\nANSWER: Based on the provided sources, there is no indication of a significant third-party candidate in the 2024 election for Arizona's 1st Congressional District that could notably affect the outcome.\n\nThe sources primarily focus on the Democratic and Republican candidates, David Schweikert and Amish Shah, respectively. While there are mentions of independent and third-party candidates in other districts, there is no specific mention of a significant third-party candidate in the 1st Congressional District that could influence the election outcome.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n**UNCLEAR**, but leaning towards **NO** based on the lack of information about any significant third-party candidates in this specific district.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is David Schweikert currently leading in polls for Arizona's 1st Congressional District in the 2024 election?\nANSWER: The current polling data and forecasts for the 2024 election in Arizona's 1st Congressional District do not definitively indicate that David Schweikert is leading. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- The district is described as highly competitive, with some forecasters rating the election as a toss-up, others as Tilt Republican, and one as Lean Republican.\n- There is no specific mention of current polling numbers that show Schweikert leading. Instead, the forecasts highlight the competitive nature of the race.\n\nGiven this information, the answer is **UNCLEAR** because the sources provided do not specify current polling numbers that would indicate whether Schweikert is leading or not.\n\n---\n\nSUBQUESTION: Is the national political climate in October 2024 favoring Democratic candidates?\nANSWER: Based on the sources provided, the national political climate in October 2024 does not appear to be strongly favoring Democratic candidates. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Party Identification and Economic Confidence**: Gallup polls indicate that more U.S. adults identify as Republican or lean toward the Republican Party (48%) compared to those who identify as or lean Democratic (45%). Additionally, the Economic Confidence Index is negative, reflecting Americans' dissatisfaction with the economy, which is typically favorable to the Republican Party.\n\n2. **Polling and Voter Expectations**: While some polls show Kamala Harris with a slight edge over Donald Trump, the race is described as fiercely competitive and neck-and-neck, both nationally and in key battleground states. The margins between Harris and Trump in these states are often within the polling error range, indicating a virtual tie.\n\n3. **Political Environment**: The overall political environment, as measured by Gallup, favors the Republican Party in terms of party identification, handling of key issues, and economic perceptions. This suggests that the environment is not particularly favorable to Democratic candidates.\n\nGiven these points, the answer is:\n\n**NO**", "comment": "(a) **Time left until the outcome is known**: 11 days remain until the November 5, 2024, general election.\n\n(b) **Outcome if nothing changed**: If the current conditions persist, David Schweikert is slightly favored to win re-election in Arizona's 1st Congressional District.\n\n(c) **Forecast if there was only a quarter of the time left (approximately 3 days)**: With less time for any significant changes, Schweikert's chances of winning would be marginally higher due to incumbency and current leanings.\n\n(d) **Forecast if there was 4 times the time left (approximately 44 days)**: With more time, uncertainties increase, and the probability of an upset by Amish Shah would be slightly higher due to potential shifts in campaign dynamics.\n\n---\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n- **Incumbency Advantage**: David Schweikert has been in Congress since 2010 and has a history of winning close elections. Incumbents generally have an advantage due to name recognition and established voter bases.\n\n- **District Lean**: Arizona's 1st Congressional District has a slight Republican lean (Cook PVI of R+2). In the 2020 presidential election, the district narrowly voted for Joe Biden, indicating it is competitive but not heavily leaning toward either party.\n\n- **Election Forecasts**: Major election forecasters rate the race from Toss-up to Lean Republican. None rate it as leaning Democratic. This suggests that, while competitive, Schweikert has a slight edge.\n\n- **Campaign Funding**: Both parties are heavily investing in this race. The House Majority PAC plans to spend over $6 million for Shah, while the Congressional Leadership Fund is spending about $4.9 million for Schweikert. The substantial support on both sides indicates the race's competitiveness but doesn't necessarily give a decisive advantage to either candidate.\n\n- **Polling Data**: There is no clear recent polling data indicating that Amish Shah has overtaken Schweikert. The lack of definitive polling benefits the incumbent, as challengers typically need to demonstrate momentum.\n\n- **National Political Climate**: The current national mood does not strongly favor Democrats. Party identification and economic indicators suggest a slight Republican advantage, which could benefit Schweikert.\n\n- **Absence of New Scandals**: Schweikert has not been involved in any new scandals or ethics investigations since 2022 that could negatively impact his re-election chances.\n\n- **Voter Registration and Turnout**: There is no clear evidence of a significant increase in Democratic voter registration in the district since the last election. Without a surge in new Democratic voters, the incumbent's base remains relatively secure.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while the race is competitive, the slight advantages lean toward David Schweikert being re-elected.\n\n**Probability:  sixty-five  percent (65%)**", "probability": 65}
